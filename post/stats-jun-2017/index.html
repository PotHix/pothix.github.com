          <p>I&rsquo;m ready to review my stats for June and share them with you! Are
you? Hope so! :D</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>Last month I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2sNBJQs">Deep Work</a> again because I
was preparing to work for a new company. The new company
is <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>, but this is a topic for a another post. It
proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From
their reading list I also
took <a href="http://amzn.to/2ubyLXo">The score takes care of itself</a>
and <a href="http://amzn.to/2syNucX">Start with Why</a>. Both are great books on
how to think your products and leadership, highly recommended!</p>
<p>Before joining I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2sz4oIx">The secrets of story</a>,
a great book on how to write novels and keep your reader turning
pages. There are many great tips there, I really recommend if you want
to write a novel someday.</p>
<p>The other one is <a href="http://amzn.to/2tBTV42">Louder than words</a>. It&rsquo;s all
about how we deal with meaning. It was interesting to think about
meaning as a concept beyond words, for computer scientists, think
about words as being pointers to a meaning. :)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, 4 books in a month, I&rsquo;m proud of myself :P</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
968
708
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>968 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>708 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (861 unread and
662 read), I got around <strong>11% more unread articles</strong> and only <strong>6.5%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>It was a lot more unread articles and not so much read ones. I will
have to work on it again.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Looks like my coding productivity is back to normal. Hope to improve
my deep working this month.</p>
<p>Much of what I did was related to improve static pages and
documentation projects, so I have a lot of <code>bash</code> and <code>Markdown</code> as
most used languages.</p>

<p>Editors are pretty much the same as last month&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eventials.com/Globalcode/quarta-a-tarde-tdconline-floripa-2017-stadium">HTML5 Game development</a> at <a href="www.impacta.com.br">Impacta Tecnologia</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Here is the current status of my goal for presentations this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>A good progress this month and I have three more scheduled for next month. Go go go!</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>1 day and 23 hours</strong> of podcast time. It&rsquo;s a lot less than last
month, but that&rsquo;s common as I listened to many audiobooks instead.</p>
<p>I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just for the record, this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. It&rsquo;s less
than what I&rsquo;m used to see but it&rsquo;s OK since I left my previous job and
took some days &ldquo;off&rdquo; (not exactly off, but that&rsquo;s it).</p>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>Almost <strong>4x more than April</strong>. :D</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>For the first time (I think&hellip;) I reached my goal! New job + deep work FTW.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
<strong>10.6k</strong> steps (318/30), a lot more than next month (it was <strong>8.3k</strong>) \o/.</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>11.7km</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>My weight is almost the same:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>My sleep data:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Less average sleeping and less deep sleeping for this month. It&rsquo;s not
so much (around 10min avg for both), but I should keep an eye on it.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 35 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of <strong>Better call saul</strong>, two seasons of <strong>Sense
8</strong>, and <strong>Mr. Robot</strong> (finally! :D).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit confusing to calculate how many days I spent on TV shows
this month, but I now reached the mark of 1 month of time spent (or
wasted, pick your side) watching TV. =/</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>My stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>34156</strong> words written (<strong>26914</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>634</strong> corrections made (<strong>243</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>10332</strong> unique words (<strong>11478</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 8k words written compared to last month but also almost 3x more corrections made :(.
Unique words are less than next month but not so much.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>For some reason 1 country and 1 city is gone from my timeline, maybe I
did some cleanup but didn&rsquo;t remember. In the other hand, the amount of
places I visited increased by <strong>55</strong>! I&rsquo;m not sure why that happened,
since I did not traveled this month. It was probably some cleanup made
by Google Maps folks.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>I also decided to add the amount of time spent in a vehicle this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>9 hours in the whole month! In contrast, I walked 111km, which is
probably part of my daily dog walking / Gym routine. <strong>Remote work
FTW</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents a small portion of 17% of net income</strong>, the
rest is being invested. Yeah, but again this was atypical month. I
know it&rsquo;s being repetitive already but as I&rsquo;m changing jobs, I
received some money related to Brazilian work law stuff (yeah, it&rsquo;s
complicated) and almost everything was invested. Part of this money
will be used in the next month, because I will not be able to generate
invoices yet, thanks to the very slow Brazilian processes to have your
own company.</p>
<p>I had to change my portfolio because of this changes in my
professional life and also because of the current state of economics
and politics in Brazil.</p>
<p>This month I increased my total savings by <strong>5.2%</strong> and reached
<strong>72.46%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.</p>
<p><strong>It took 4 hours and 03 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<p>Almost the double comparing to last month. As I had to change a lot of
things on my investment portfolio, it took some time to organize
everything again.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I feel great this month. :)</p>
<p>The new job is amazing and I can focus on my deep working routine to
actually do real stuff. I&rsquo;m still getting used to the new workflow and
software I have to support, but it&rsquo;s being an awesome experience.</p>
<p>Hope to have more good news next month.</p>

                            I've added three different RSS feeds here based on categories. The idea was to help you the tech guy that don't want to see what kind of motorcycle I have, or the english speaker that don't want to see portuguese posts on his feed reader.
                            <br /><br />
                            So, I have a feed for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix">all my posts</a>, for the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix">English posts</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech">Tech related posts</a>. Choose one and be happy! :)
