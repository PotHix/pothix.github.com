          <p>From time to time, I receive questions about my productivity workflow, so I
decided to write it down here. Keep in mind it&rsquo;s a living thing and may change
with time, but what I&rsquo;m documenting here is what I&rsquo;m using right now.</p>
<h2 id="tool">Tool</h2>
<p>As you probably know, <a href="/post/doist-pothix">I work for Doist</a> for some time now,
and I&rsquo;m a Todoist user since 2007, so the my tool of choice is quite obvious.</p>
<p>I love how <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> brings simplicity to creating and
managing tasks. Things become even better when you add filters to the mix. 😉</p>
<p>The organization for my top level projects looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal</strong>: Anything personal like money, investments, random thoughts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>MyCompany</strong>: Bureaucracy of having a BR company, things to pay, people to reach, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: Everything related to my full time job. It&rsquo;s probably the one with more sub-projects and tasks</li>
<li><strong>Hobbies</strong>: I have many, so I have a project for each. Examples: Drums, MTG, Cardistry, Photography, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Me &amp; Wife</strong>: A shared project with my wife. Anything we do together we add there.</li>
<li><strong>Others</strong>: projects I could not fit in any other category. Example: todoist integrations</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these top level projects have have their own sub-projects.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>I use due dates to guide my life inside todoist. Every day I open Todoist and
find what I have to do during that day.</p>
<p>When I have something in mind it goes to my <code>Inbox</code> project. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
if I&rsquo;m at the computer or walking on the street, I just open todoist and add it
there so I can do the triage later.</p>
<p>I try to apply the <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> idea,
but my own version of GTD looks like <a href="https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/">Zen To
Done</a>
to be honest. The principles are the same in the end, but the methods differ.</p>
<p>Both methods say you have to process your <code>Inbox</code> at least once a day, and
that&rsquo;s exactly what I do. Every task I add to my <code>Inbox</code> in project on Todoist
will be processed and added to the right project with a possible due date so it
will pop up in my Today list in the future.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter much if I will finish all of the tasks or not, but they are
there to remember me what I planned for that day and what is important to keep
focused on. If I can&rsquo;t finish at the end of the day I postpone for the next or
find a due in the future where this task will it makes more sense to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Everything</strong> I have to do is added to Todoist. I don&rsquo;t keep anything in my
mind because I don&rsquo;t want anything asking for attention when I have to focus.
If there&rsquo;s something to do on Monday, I can rest assured that Todoist will
notify me about that in the right day and time.</p>
<h2 id="routine">Routine</h2>
<p>I love routines, but it&rsquo;s important that I&rsquo;m able to have full control over
them, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I have. I built my current routine based on my
schedule, my wife&rsquo;s schedule, the times I feel more productive, and other
studies I did to myself through the years.</p>
<p>Every weekday I have at least 8 tasks that are fixed and define my routine:</p>
<ul>
<li>[06:00] Wake up and prepare breakfast
<ul>
<li>I have some notes on this one. Sometimes I want to prepare a different
breakfast and never remember how to do it, so it&rsquo;s there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[08:00] Walk the dog</li>
<li>[10:30] Start the deep work session</li>
<li>[12:30] Go to the Gym</li>
<li>[14:00] Record body data
<ul>
<li>I try to quantify myself as much as possible. This is just a reminder to add my weight to the tracking app</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[17:00] Start the deep work session</li>
<li>[19:00] Relax after a good day of work</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the things <strong>I want to do</strong>. Sometimes people say things like: &ldquo;You
let your task app say what you have to do&rdquo;, but is quite the opposite. I plan
what I want for my days and I use my task list to keep me focused on what I
want.</p>
<p>Some of these tasks trigger integrations that help me get laser focused on what
I want to do. A good example is the <code>Start the deep work session</code>, as it
triggers the &ldquo;Focus time&rdquo; of <a href="https://rescuetime.com">rescuetime</a> and block
sites I consider not productive.</p>
<h2 id="reccuring-tasks">Reccuring tasks</h2>
<p>I have some recurring tasks that are not part of my routine and they are not
related to work. It&rsquo;s also important to make time for the things you care
about, not just work-related tasks.</p>
<p>Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check a Slack group of friends I want to keep in touch</li>
<li>Check the Discord of the conference/community I&rsquo;m currently a core organizer</li>
<li>Remember to track my progress on Goodreads and write reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Track my reading progress help me to stay on track. Writing reviews help me to
retain more information by reviewing it to myself.</p>
<h2 id="filtering-to-avoid-distractions">Filtering to avoid distractions</h2>
<p>I use Todoist filters a lot!</p>
<p>Filters are very useful to&hellip; hm&hellip; filter non-important tasks from your current
focus mode i.e. if you&rsquo;re doing deep work, you don&rsquo;t need to know your routine.</p>
<p>I like to consume books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15679564.Willian_Molinari">my average is 30 books a
year</a>, and
every time I consume a book that mentions productivity I try the method with
filters.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break down my filters and explain their usage 🙂</p>
<h3 id="peak-trough-recovery">Peak, trough, recovery</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peak &ndash; <em><code>@peak &amp; today &amp; (assigned to: me | !assigned)</code></em></li>
<li>Trough &ndash; <em><code>(@trough | (!@peak &amp; !@recovery)) &amp;  today &amp; (assigned to: me | !assigned)</code></em></li>
<li>Recovery &ndash; <em><code>(@recovery | @peak) &amp; today &amp; (assigned to: me | !assigned)</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I also rely on Todoist labels to mark the tasks I want to have
in each of these chunks.</p>
<p>These filters came from the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2254843906">When</a>.
I used the <a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf">Daily when tracker</a> to check when was my peak, trough, and recovery times:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png" alt="A sheet of paper with something that looks like a chart showing the times I feel more productive"></p>
<p>I also use the concept of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243">Deep work</a> described by the book with the same name.</p>
<p>This is the reason why I have the task &ldquo;<em>Start the deep work session</em>&rdquo; in the
morning and at the end of the afternooon.</p>
<h3 id="deep-work-filters">Deep work filters</h3>
<p>Based on the same <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243">Deep work</a>
book mentioned above, I also use <code>@deepwork</code> labels on Todoist so I can filter
the right tasks depending on my current mode.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the concept, it basically tells you to reserve chunks of your
day to work on things without distractions. It means: no cellphones, no social
media, no chatting, no email, etc.</p>
<p>I usually have the following filters as favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep @ Work &ndash; <em><code>(today | overdue)  &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; @deep_work &amp; ##Work</code></em></li>
<li>Shallow @ Work &ndash; <em><code>(today | overdue)  &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; !@deep_work &amp; ##Work</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;<code>Deep @ Work</code>&rdquo; filter gets all tasks from projects under my &ldquo;<code>Work</code>&rdquo;
project that should be done <code>today</code> and have the &ldquo;<code>@deepwork</code>&rdquo; tag.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<code>Shallow @ Work</code>&rdquo; filter is almost the same but it takes everything
<strong>without</strong> the &ldquo;<code>@deepwork</code>&rdquo; label. Everything else without this label is
considered shallow work.</p>
<h3 id="priority-filters">Priority filters</h3>
<p>I also have some filters based on the tasks I set priorities, so I can quickly
see what should be a priority for my day instead of just reacting to what is
going on. It doens&rsquo;t work all the time because <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/1*tDk8uelQtJnpx33rIQVjjA.png">urgent and
important</a>
things sometimes pop up, but it gives me a clear view of what my priorities
are.</p>
<p>Here are the filters I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority today &ndash; <em>``(today | overdue) &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; p1</em></li>
<li>Priority @ Work &ndash; <em><code>(today | overdue) &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; (p1 | p2 | p3) &amp; ##Work</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>These two helps me when I just want to focus on the work I have to do today.
Sometimes I have personal things that are also priority, so I keep both
together, but I mostly use the <code>Priority @ Work</code>.</p>
<h2 id="integrations-and-automation">Integrations and automation</h2>
<p>I mentioned the trigger I have for rescuetime&rsquo;s Focus mode but it&rsquo;s not the only automation I have. Here are some others:</p>
<h3 id="shopping-list">Shopping list</h3>
<p>I keep a shopping list in Todoist shared with my wife. Every time we see that
something is missing and have to be bought, we try to add it there right away.</p>
<p>I have the location reminder enabled for Todoist in on my phone, so it reminds
me to check that list every time I&rsquo;m nearby a local supermarket, which happens
almost every day because of my daily routine.</p>
<p>Every time I check a task, IFTTT sends a message to a group chat in Telegram,
informing my wife that it&rsquo;s done so she will not buy it again. Sometimes we
forget to check the list, so it&rsquo;s helpful to get a reminder that it was bought
already.</p>
<h3 id="weekly-snippets">Weekly snippets</h3>
<p>Every week at Doist, we post a list of important tasks we did during the past
week and what we plan to do during the next.</p>
<p>I add a &ldquo;<code>@snippet</code>&rdquo; label to every task I want to report. When a task with a
&ldquo;<code>@snippet</code>&rdquo; label is completed, IFTTT creates a new task in a project called
&ldquo;<code>Snippets</code>&rdquo; with the completion date and the task project in the task title.</p>
<p>When I want to report that, I go the the &ldquo;<code>Snippets</code>&rdquo; project, click on the menu,
<strong>Export as a Template</strong>, and <strong>Export as file</strong>. I have a note in the same
project with a command the does the job of formatting that:</p>
<pre><code>cat ~/Downloads/Snippets.csv | grep -v project_note | grep &quot;task,&quot; | awk -F &quot;,&quot; '/1/ {print &quot;- &quot; $2}'; rm /home/pothix/Downloads/Snippets.csv
</code></pre><p>So I can just post it to <a href="https://twist.com">Twist</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-tipical-day-looks-like">How a tipical day looks like</h2>
<p>I wake up early (because that&rsquo;s what I want for myself, I don&rsquo;t have to),
prepare the breakfast, and take some time to eat and chat with my wife. We try
to not waste our time together looking at cellphones.</p>
<p>After breakfast I check my Todoist and what has to be done for the day, just to
be sure there&rsquo;s nothing pressing for the next 1-2 hours. If it&rsquo;s OK, I take
these 1-2 hours for myself. I&rsquo;m now writing this blog post. ;)</p>
<p>After that, the <a href="#routine">routine I described</a> starts. There are many other
tasks that are not part of my routine, so I use filters to focus on what I
think fits better for that time.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I postpone my tasks (if any) or just let them become
overdue to be postponed quickly via Todoist on the next day. I usually don&rsquo;t
have anything pressing from 6-8 a.m. so I don&rsquo;t have to check my plans for
tomorrow every night.</p>
<h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2007, when I started looking for a productivity tool
and found Todoist. It&rsquo;s a lot of practice to have a working system/process.</p>
<p>I used different tools along the way (Remember the milk, Toodledo, Habitica,
Thingking Rock, Google keep, and the list goes on) but I always came back to
Todoist because I really like it. It&rsquo;s not by coincidence that I&rsquo;m working for
Doist, I think about that since the beginning, but decided to apply for it in
2017.</p>
<p><strong>I love Todoist and I recommend it, but keep in mind that it&rsquo;s not about the
tool, but your mindset, and how you organize your process.</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>persistence is important</strong>. Your process will certainly
fail (as the one I described do), but you will improve it and make it (and
yourself!) better in the process. If it&rsquo;s not working, just think about it and
adjust it to match your way of doing things.</p>
<p>Stay focused and productive 😉</p>

                            I've added three different RSS feeds here based on categories. The idea was to help you the tech guy that don't want to see what kind of motorcycle I have, or the english speaker that don't want to see portuguese posts on his feed reader.
                            <br /><br />
                            So, I have a feed for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix">all my posts</a>, for the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix">English posts</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech">Tech related posts</a>. Choose one and be happy! :)
