          <p>Okay, here we go for the first full month working in my new job. :)</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>This month I read
<a href="http://amzn.to/2hrZ7Cu">Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman</a>,
which was recommended by the other <a href="https://doist.com">Doisters</a>. It&rsquo;s a great
book by the guy who built the company <a href="www.patagonia.com">Patagonia</a>, a
bootstrapped company, from scratch. Their way of thinking looks a lot like the
way we think at Doist.</p>
<p>The second one is
<a href="http://amzn.to/2v2fElh">Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better</a>. I
bought this book on Audible daily deal and it surprised me in a good way. It was
made for teachers in the beginning but was changed for the general public. You
can still feel the education background but it is not a bad thing for me. I
found some good strategies my teachers used on me when I was on college.</p>
<p>The 7th season of Game of Thrones just started and I decided to
read
<a href="http://amzn.to/2v1YcgJ">A Game of Thrones, the fist book of A Song of Ice and Fire</a>. After
reading it I found the 1st season to be really loyal to the books, which is
really nice. If you, like me, enjoys the TV show a lot, I really recommend
reading. There are some background and feelings you understand better when
reading the books. I hope to start the next one soon.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1044
777
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1044 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>777 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (968 unread and
708 read), I got around <strong>8% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>9%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>It improved a little bit compared to last month but the unread count is still
growing which means I will probably never read many of those articles. =/</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new here. I have one big peak of almost 7 hours of coding but the rest
is stable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still fixing some docs and get all the projects up and running, so I still
have a lot of <code>bash</code> and some <code>markdown</code>, but <code>Python</code> is growing.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Editors are pretty much the same as last month&rsquo;s.</p>

</ul>
<p>Six presentations in one month. Three of them were in the same day. This month
is a personal record for me. 🎉</p>
<p>It was also a huge step towards my goal:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>Hm&hellip; I kinda finished the yearly challenge in July. 😬</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how far I can go! :D</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>I want to add the amount of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>554 tasks</strong> completed this month. :D</p>
<p>I also included my streaks but I think I will have to improve my daily goals,
they are too small for me.</p>
<p>I have plans to create a better way to extract data from my Todoist account, but
I will need some time to work on it.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days and 18 hours</strong> of podcast time, that&rsquo;s a lot. :)</p>
<p>I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just for the record, this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<p><a href="http://castalio.info/">Castalio Podcast</a> is going up every month. I was a guest <a href="http://castalio.info/episodio-110-willian-molinari-desconstruindo-a-web.html">on their podcast</a>, btw! :D</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. My full-time job is
taking all my energy currently and there is not so much time spent working as a
freelancer this month. The good part is that I&rsquo;m working a lot less
than <a href="/post/stats-may-2017/#working-hours">the previous months</a> but I&rsquo;m
exhausted in the same way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed the way I&rsquo;m tracking my projects and now I can see the difference
between Deep Work and Shallow work in a better way:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that I&rsquo;m spending 1/3 of my time in Deep Work state. :)</p>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>It was really hard to work on personal projects this month. This 11 hours was my
presentations. I did not consider the whole day speaking at TDC though. :)</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>Another month reaching my productivity goal! :D</p>
<p><strong>The only month I reached my goal before joining Doist was March</strong>, the month
right after my vacations, and now it&rsquo;s the second month in a row. Hope to keep
it.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
<strong>8k</strong> steps (249/31), it came back to my previous average.</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>8.3km</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Some more weight but not so much:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>MiFit app interface for sleep data changed a little bit but here is my data for
this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>A bit more average sleeping (<strong>7h29m</strong> for the last month) and <strong>a lot</strong> more
deep sleeping for this month \o/ (last month was <strong>1h04</strong>).</p>
<p>I bought the Mi band 2, it may have some better monitoring. Let&rsquo;s see how it
goes for the next month. :)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new feature comparing my stats to the user base:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep_stats.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep_stats.jpg" alt="Stats about my sleep data" title="Stats about my sleep data"></a></p>
<p>I liked it. :)</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 24 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of the two seasons of <strong>Mr. Robot</strong> (really recommended for
programmers, BTW), <strong>American Gods</strong>, and <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>.</p>
<p>I spent <strong>20 hours</strong> watching TV this month.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>51018</strong> words written (<strong>34156</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>1272</strong> corrections made (<strong>634</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>10485</strong> unique words (<strong>10332</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all my work conversations are in English, I have a lot more data here.
Less unique words than last month (🤔) but almost 1/3 more words. The bad part
is the corrections made, <strong>2x more</strong> than last month. =/</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Again, for some reason 1 city is gone from my timeline, that&rsquo;s weird. In the
other hand, the amount of places I visited increased by <strong>14</strong>. I&rsquo;m not sure if
I can trust on this data from Google Maps.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>I also decided to add the amount of time spent in a vehicle this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>My presentations increased the time spent on transport, I think. I don&rsquo;t know if
I can trust on the distance walking.</p>
<p>But still, 16 hours in transport for the whole month! <strong>Remote work FTW</strong>!</p>
<p>Here is a funny metric:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<p>The time I have to walk to &ldquo;get to the moon&rdquo;, LOL.</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this
month</strong>. <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">As predicted last month</a>, I did not receive
anything because I was still waiting for the whole process to get my company
ready to generate invoices. It took almost two months to complete but I think
it&rsquo;s done and I can finally generate new invoices to receive my payment.</p>
<p>Most part of my expenses goes to &ldquo;Despesas do trabalho&rdquo; (work expenses), since I
had to pay a lot of taxes to get my own company ready.</p>
<p>It was amazing to find that I still increased my total savings by <strong>0.5%</strong> (not
so much compared to <strong>5.2%</strong> of the last month, but it&rsquo;s positive!) and reached
<strong>72.83%</strong> of my goal. It happened thanks to my wife supporting our expenses. ❤️</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours to write this post</strong></p>
<p>1 hour less than last month but I will still work to improve this time.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>My new job is taking a lot of my energies. There is a lot of work to do and new
stuff to learn. I&rsquo;m doing my best to make the software I love since 2007 become
a great platform to developers build their stuff on top of it.</p>
<p>I was not expecting to be so tired at the end of the day, I had to put some
personal projects aside for some months.</p>
<p>Aside of that, the company and my co-workers are great, I&rsquo;m really enjoying the
experience of building a great product.</p>

                            I've added three different RSS feeds here based on categories. The idea was to help you the tech guy that don't want to see what kind of motorcycle I have, or the english speaker that don't want to see portuguese posts on his feed reader.
                            <br /><br />
                            So, I have a feed for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix">all my posts</a>, for the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix">English posts</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech">Tech related posts</a>. Choose one and be happy! :)
