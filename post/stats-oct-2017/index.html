<p>This month was very unusual because I was traveling through Portugal and Spain
for work and tourism, so it will probably affect my stats a lot. With that said,
let&rsquo;s see how it is. 😄</p>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<p>I read some pages from <a href="http://amzn.to/2ztCDZU">Elixir in Action</a>, but
unfortunately did not finish any book this month. I usually don&rsquo;t read that
much when traveling, so it&rsquo;s sad but expected. 😞</p>

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>
and the same script to calculate the amount of articles I read:</p>

<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1230
905
</code></pre>

<p>It means I have <strong>1230 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>905 articles Read</strong>. Comparing
with my results from the last month (<strong>1214 unread</strong> and <strong>898 read</strong>), I got around
<strong>1.5% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1% more read articles</strong>.</p>

<p>I think it was a good think to not read my Feedly in a daily basis but weekly
instead. I was adding a lot of articles to my Pocket account but was not reading
them so it was wasted time. By checking weekly, I can still catch good articles
without dedicating daily time for it.</p>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" /></a></p>

<p>The empty days are related to the days-off I took to walk around Lisbon,
Barcelona, Madrid, and Toledo. The first half of the month I was working from
the Doist office in Porto and the second half I was working home. It was almost
the same, excluding that Tuesday when I worked more than people usually do in
the office. :P</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" /></a></p>

<p>And not it makes sense for me. <code>Bash</code> first and <code>Python</code> right after. :)</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" /></a></p>

<p><code>Emacs</code> before <code>bash</code>, that&rsquo;s nice. It&rsquo;s kinda contradictory with the previous
metric but it&rsquo;s acceptable given that I can run many commands at once. I&rsquo;m not
sure if it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep <code>bash</code> here, maybe I will just remove this
plugin.</p>

<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MrNQeQDK-U">Snake game using Python and PyGame</a> at <a href="https://gurusp.org">Porto Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It was really nice to speak at Porto Python in Portugal. It was kinda funny
because of the Portuguese differences that I don&rsquo;t know, so I probably mixed up
many words. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/rdotpy">Roman Imankulov</a> for inviting
me to speak.</p>

<p>Here is the chart comparing to my goal for this year:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/presentations.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations" /></a></p>

<p>The new (bonus) goal is to reach 25 this year. Not sure if I can do that. :)</p>

<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>

<p>This is the amount of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month" /></a></p>

<p><strong>387 tasks</strong> completed this month (<strong>22 more</strong> than last month).</p>

<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>

<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" /></a></p>

<p><strong>2 days and 17 hours</strong> of podcast time, 1 day more than last month. It happened
because I decided to catch up to the unheard episodes when I got home. 😄</p>

<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" /></a></p>

<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>

<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>

<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl" /></a></p>

<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. As you can see, I
took many days totally off. :)</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work" /></a></p>

<p>I tried to use Toggl when I was in the office just to compare with my
productivity at home. It was almost the same as if I&rsquo;m working from home, so
kudos to the Porto office. :)</p>

<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-personal-projects.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" /></a></p>

<p>As expected, just the time related to my talk at Porto Python.</p>

<p>I will not post my data related to <strong>rescuetime</strong> this month because I was
working in the fix for my problem and their team fixed the problem. Rescuetime
stats will be back next month. :)</p>

<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/activity.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" /></a></p>

<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of <strong>11.6k</strong>
steps (<sup>359</sup>&frasl;<sub>31</sub>). I think <code>mean</code> is not a good aggregation function for this data
because when I was traveling I had days like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/walking-toledo.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/walking-toledo.jpg" alt="Walking around Toledo" title="Walking around Toledo" /></a></p>

<p>Well&hellip; I really like to walk when I&rsquo;m traveling. :)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my Google fit is missing some data, so I will not post all charts
as usual.</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/physical-activity-steps.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month" /></a></p>

<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month" /></a></p>

<p>Almost the same as the last month but 10 minutes more for <strong>avg sleep</strong> and
<strong>avg deep sleep</strong>. There are some comparisons with their database:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" alt="Deep sleep comparison" title="Deep sleep comparison" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so bad after all. :)</p>

<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 15 episodes this
month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/tvshows.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" /></a></p>

<p>When I got back, we decided to watch <strong>Stranger Things (season 2)</strong> and get back
to <strong>Orphan Black (season 3)</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still difficult to calculate how much time I spent watching TV this month
(because I could not track last month in a good way) but I think I watched 17
hours of TV. I used <a href="http://tii.me">tii.me</a> to calculate the second season of
stranger things and calculated 40 min for each of the 5 episodes of Orphan
black.</p>

<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>

<p>My stats for this month:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>49657</strong> words written (last month was <strong>73969</strong>), <strong>26487</strong> of them written
in the last week of October</li>
<li><strong>1212</strong> corrections made (last month was <strong>1826</strong>), <strong>772</strong> of them made in
the last week of October</li>
<li><strong>12725</strong> unique words (last month was <strong>17139</strong>), <strong>5806</strong> of them written in
the last week of October</li>
</ul>

<p>This month is really atypical and should not be compared with the previous month
but it has its own interesting facts. The last week of October was really
interesting. I had a lot of material to compile and write down for my team. For
this reason there is a lot of words written.</p>

<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>

<p>This section is really nice! 😁
As I said, I visited two new countries:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-countries.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-countries.png" alt="New countries" title="New countries" /></a></p>

<p>And 5 new cities:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-cities.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-cities.png" alt="New cities" title="New cities" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the email sent by Google timeline was not so descriptive this
time. But the other 2 cities are <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GWf9vcDakNB2">Toledo</a>
and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/THiztuMChqs">Lisbon</a>.</p>

<p>So, in summary:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-general.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data" /></a></p>

<p>It was almost 100 new places visited 😱.</p>

<p>Here is the time spend in vehicles:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-time-distance.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance" /></a></p>

<p>I was expecting more time than that, but it looks accurate in case it&rsquo;s not
considering airplanes. I took a train from Lisbon to Porto (3.5 hours) and a
train from Madrid to Toledo and back (1.5h maybe).</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-moon.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon" /></a></p>

<p>Hope to reach the moon some day.</p>

<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>

<p>My expenses for this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/expenses.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month" /></a></p>

<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described in
<a href="/post/stats-jul-2017">the</a> <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">last</a> <a href="/post/stats-aug-2017">four</a> <a href="/post/stats-sep-2017">months</a> still
persists, for this reason, there&rsquo;s no money coming yet. :(</p>

<p>Part of the problem seems to be solved and now I&rsquo;m back to the normal
process. Hope to have everything set up this month.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this every month, you already know that my wife is paying all
of our bills until my situation gets back to normal and I&rsquo;m really glad to have
someone to rely on when things like these happen. ❤</p>

<p>I traveled to Europe last month and part of the expenses were paid by me to
receive the reimbursement for it later. As I&rsquo;m not able to receive my payment
for some time now, it caused a negative impact in my savings.</p>

<p>My total savings <strong>decreased by 1.31%</strong>, which means that I have <strong>73.26%</strong> of my
goal. 😢</p>

<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>

<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>

<p><strong>It took 4 hours and 10 minutes to write this post</strong></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>It was a great month. I forgot about the whole problem of not being able to
receive any money and took the whole month to meet new people and places. 😄</p>

<p>It was really nice to meet 12 people (from 8 different countries) of the team in
person and also represent the company at <a href="https://hackupc.com/">hackUPC</a>.</p>

<p>During this trip I decided to say in hostels most of the time to talk to people
from different cultures (and also because I had to pay for it&hellip; 😄). I talked
to people from Germany, Poland, Spain, Scotland, Colombia, Canada, Lithuania,
Czech Republic, Japan, Brazil, Uruguay, Australia, Russia, Ireland, Portugal,
India, Belgium, Bosnia, France, Argentina, and Netherlands. It was not just a
&ldquo;Hi, where are you from?&rdquo;, most of them were 30min+ conversations and some of
them took more then 2 hours.</p>

<p>I also bought a sword (a replica of Andúril), but that&rsquo;s a story for a different
post. :D</p>

<p>So&hellip;mission accomplished for this month. o/</p>

                            I've added three different RSS feeds here based on categories. The idea was to help you the tech guy that don't want to see what kind of motorcycle I have, or the english speaker that don't want to see portuguese posts on his feed reader.
                            <br /><br />
                            So, I have a feed for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix">all my posts</a>, for the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix">English posts</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech">Tech related posts</a>. Choose one and be happy! :)
