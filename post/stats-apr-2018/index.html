<p>It&rsquo;s time for April metrics! 📊</p>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my Goodreads account</a>.</p>

<p>Again, just one book this month, and again, a 5 stars one!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2KgEAKE">A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</a>. This book was on my reading list for many months now. After reading it, I realized I&rsquo;m practicing a fraction of Stoicism for many years. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2355647662">Here is my review</a> if you want to read my thoughts on it.</p>

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from
<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and a script that look like the one I
used last month. Here is the script with the actual data:</p>

<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1446,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:1.8,&quot;read&quot;:1050,&quot;read_pct&quot;:2.86}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1501,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:3.66,&quot;read&quot;:1096,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.2}
</code></pre>

<p>It means I have <strong>1501 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1096 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1446 unread</strong>
and <strong>1050 read</strong>), I got around <strong>3.6% more unread articles</strong> and
<strong>4.2% more read articles</strong>.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m reading more than adding, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m happy with
this situation. It&rsquo;s been some months since I&rsquo;m complaining about my
<em>read it later</em> but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big problem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m experimenting with an integration between <a href="https://ifttt.com/p/pothix">Pocket + Google Sheets
via IFTTT</a>. The idea is to count the
number of articles read and maybe we will have something new next month.</p>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" /></a></p>

<p>Nothing new here, 70-30 between Vim and Emacs.</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" /></a></p>

<p>I had some national holidays + days off this month. Also, I had some
non-coding tasks (mostly writing) and it obviously impacted my hours
of coding.</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" /></a></p>

<p><code>Python</code>, <code>Markdown</code>, and <code>Ruby</code> are the most used languages, as
usual. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no mention of <code>Rust</code> or <code>Elixir</code> this
month, but at least I have a small percentage of <code>Golang</code>.</p>

<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>

<p>Again, no speaking this month. I was thinking about it, and I think it
is a hangover from the 21 presentations from last year.</p>

<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>

<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month" /></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month" /></a></p>

<p>Things are back to normal, I guess. 🙃</p>

<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>

<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" /></a></p>

<p><strong>3 days and 6 hours</strong> of podcast time. It seems that 3 days is
becoming average for me. As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and
their times:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title" /></a></p>

<p>Remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear as
&ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>

<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>

<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl" /></a></p>

<p>I had 19 work days tracked this month, and I worked for 157 hours,
which mean that <strong>I worked 5 hours more than I should</strong> (it was 11 in
the last month, so it&rsquo;s improving! 😀).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work" /></a></p>

<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meetings are stable (and productive), considering two 1-1 meetings
(1 hour each) and four weekly meetings (around 40 minutes each)</li>
<li>The Shallow work task (the most generic I have) is still the big
black box. I mentioned to split the lunch time (lunch and break) but
forgot to do that last month. Maybe I will start doing it this
month (from April 15th).</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo; is still consuming a lot of time, more than 2 hours
every day. Let&rsquo;s break Twist usage down by hour:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day" /></a></p>

<p>It seems that my strategy of reading Twist in the morning is working,
but it&rsquo;s not fixing the problem of keep looking to it throughout the
day. I should probably just skim it in the morning and get back to it
at the end of the day. Still trying to improve this process though.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" /></a></p>

<p>Again, that&rsquo;s not much to compare here, but at least it seems stable. 👍</p>

<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" /></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-pulse.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worst than February and March 😞. I had a pulse of 62 on February and 54 on March, and it&rsquo;s now 43. It concerns to see that, so I decided what was causing such different. When looking at the chart for the entertaining category, I saw this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-distracting.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-distracting.png" alt="RescueTime distracting chart" title="RescueTime distracting chart" /></a></p>

<p>It seems that my new (and old, at the same time) hobby Magic the
Gathering is taking a lot of my spare time. I let rescuetime track all
my time, not just working hours, and all MTG websites are considered
as very distracting. Maybe I should configure rescuetime to monitor
only &ldquo;working hours&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not sure what time should I use. 🤔</p>

<p>Still following my Telegram usage, here is the comparison from the
previous month to the current one:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime" /></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still too high for me. I have an alert of my time spent using
Telegram. The goal is not to receive this alert, but I&rsquo;m currently
failing at it. I have to improve this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to understand if I have a particular moment where I
use Telegram the most, here is the difference from the last month to
the current one:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime" /></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime" /></a></p>

<p>Hm, Telegram usage is spread throughout the day, that&rsquo;s not a good
thing. I have to keep working on it.</p>

<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" /></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity-comparison.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity_comparison.jpg" alt="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" /></a></p>

<p>This month I have <strong>8k steps</strong> compared to 10.5k from the previous
month. This change is expected since I had two weeks to move around because
of the retreat and my vacation in Santiago last month.</p>

<p>I was expecting a big change in my weight, but it was not that bad. I&rsquo;m expecting an increase next month though 😅:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/physical-activity-weight.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month" /></a></p>

<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/sleep.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month" /></a></p>

<p>Not that bad, the same as March. Hope to improve it in May. 👍</p>

<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 8
episode this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/tvshows.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" /></a></p>

<p>We finished <strong>The punisher</strong> this month. Now looking for a new TV show
to watch.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to try <a href="https://trakt.tv">trakt.tv</a>, so I can try the
movies I watch along with the TV shows. Unfortunately, tvshowtime only
tracks TV shows. Maybe we will have some new charts next month. 😉</p>

<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>

<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>61385</strong> words written ( <strong>50348</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>934</strong> corrections made (<strong>825</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>16473</strong> unique words (<strong>10944</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s expected to have a better value since last month had almost two
weeks off because of Doist retreat + vacations. Nothing outstanding
though.</p>

<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added some places to the list:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-places.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-places.png" alt="Places I visited" title="Places I visited" /></a></p>

<p>Went to two different cities this month, one of them is 450km+ from my
hometown. ✌</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the difference between last month and this month. Last
month first and <strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month" /></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data this month" title="General view of my locations data this month" /></a></p>

<p>And again, One new country according to Google. It&rsquo;s quite unstable to rely on their country count, but I think they got it right now. The number of cities did not increase for some reason. 🤷‍♂</p>

<p>As expected the amount of time commuting increased a lot this month (due to the travel I mentioned above):</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-time-distance.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month" /></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance this month" title="Location time and distance this month" /></a></p>

<p>Still many kilometers to &ldquo;reach the moon&rdquo;:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-moon.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon" /></a></p>

<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💰</p>

<p>My earnings this month were different from what I usually receive. All of this thanks to the profit sharing I receive from my previous employer. Considering that, I spent only 17% of the money earned this month.</p>

<p>From this 17%, we have the following percentages:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/expenses.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month" /></a></p>

<p>I was expecting much more from <em>Viagem</em> (traveling, the orange piece),
but it&rsquo;s good enough. <em>Transport</em> is the biggest one, but part of it
will probably be reimbursed, as it&rsquo;s my wife&rsquo;s work expenses. With that said, <em>Moradia</em> (housing?) is my most significant expense.</p>

<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m not considering the money in transit from my company to
my personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant
payment, etc.). So, without considering it, and keeping in mind that
Easynvest (one of my brokers) has a crappy system that doesn&rsquo;t work,
making me waste my time trying to retrieve the latest information
about my investments, my total savings <strong>increased by almost 4% (!!)</strong>
and now I have <strong>94.06%</strong> of my goal.</p>

<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>

<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>

<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 31 minutes</strong></p>

<p>It is quite stable since I spent 3 hours and 30 minutes last month. That
number considers the whole process of organizing my data (I usually
review my investment portfolio as well), taking screenshots, and
writing this post.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>It was a standard month. Some outliers were found because of my
Magic The Gathering hobby and 20+ hours commuting because of my
travels is not that common, but other than that, everything is just
fine.</p>

<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>

                            I've added three different RSS feeds here based on categories. The idea was to help you the tech guy that don't want to see what kind of motorcycle I have, or the english speaker that don't want to see portuguese posts on his feed reader.
                            <br /><br />
                            So, I have a feed for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix">all my posts</a>, for the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix">English posts</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech">Tech related posts</a>. Choose one and be happy! :)
