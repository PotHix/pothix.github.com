          <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I&rsquo;m working on something I really believe is good
at <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a> and I feel great.</p>
<p>As I mentioned on <a href="/post/7-anos-de-locaweb-e-a-saida/">this post</a> (in pt-BR) I
left the company I was working for the last year to join a new company. The new
company is <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a> and I&rsquo;m working for them since July.</p>
<p>Some time ago a friend asked me why I joined Doist and I realized it&rsquo;s kind of a
love story so I decided to write the post. üòÑ</p>
<p>For those who are not aware of Doist, it&rsquo;s the company
behind <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>
and <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>. Twist is a communication tool that
aims to make remote communication work better for remote teams and
Todoist is the best task manager I know.</p>
<p>I joined the company in July as I said
but
<a href="https://br.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/gtdbr/conversations/messages/4354">I&rsquo;m a Todoist user since 2007</a> (this
link requires yahoo groups membership, it&rsquo;s free but required) and I always
recommended my friends to use it. I tried many task managers in these 10 years
but I always get back to Todoist.</p>
<p>When I started my career as a software engineer in 2006, I decided to also look
for a better way to deal with my tasks. My memory is not very good, so I decided
to look for a system to help me with that and found GTD. For some time I was one
of the moderators of gtd-br, probably the biggest GTD mail list in Brazil at the
time and was looking for an application to manage my tasks.</p>
<p>I was looking for something clean, lightweight, simple, and with support to
keyboard shortcuts. Tried Toodledo, Remember the milk, thinking rock, and some
others but none of them were good enough. I was about to create my own when I
found Todoist, it was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>As an active user, I was always following the new features and the usage of new
technologies in the product. I remember when they started using HTML5 for their
mobile application, it was really great to see it.</p>
<p>At some point I found that a company called Doist appeared as the creator of
Todoist (it was just Todoist before that) and I started looking to their job
board. There were not so many positions and all of them required a good level of
Python. My focus was always Ruby and I didn&rsquo;t have any experience with large
Python projects at the time.</p>
<p>Some years passed and I had the chance to work on some Python projects at work
and gained some experience. I even created a personal project in Python to do
some scrapping for some financial data I wanted, it became a big project but it
was abandoned after Google Finance implemented my main feature. :P</p>
<p>When the time for a change came I decided to apply for companies I admire and
who believe in the same things I do. I also changed my mindset and decided to
not look for technology anymore but for products I believe are really good and
can recommend to my friends and family.</p>
<p>I worked for 5 companies in the past and none of their products were something I
can really recommend to everyone. Most of them don&rsquo;t even exist anymore. Others
are relatively good in one specific use case and country. I was working for
these companies because there were great people, good salary/benefits, or great
technology.</p>
<p>When I saw the position to &ldquo;API &amp; Integrations&rdquo; developer at Doist I decided to
apply. I was kind of insecure about the platform change (Ruby -&gt; Python) but I
believe languages are just tools to build stuff and I had enough experience to
be proficient with Python. I also love to create tools for developers and did
that in the past many times already, so it would be a great fit.</p>
<p>During the interviewing process I found that it was a <strong>perfect</strong> match of beliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote working</li>
<li>Async working (not fixed hours, we believe you will do you job and will follow
your metrics)</li>
<li>Chance to travel and meet different people/cultures</li>
<li>We read nice books and actually apply their concepts (radical candor, the
score takes care of itself, let my people go surfing)</li>
<li>Bootstrapped company</li>
<li>Amazing perks for remote working</li>
<li>Almost the same salary I had</li>
</ul>
<p>I was already doing remote work 70% of the time for my previous company and I
also have a freelance job for a company in Netherlands, so I&rsquo;m used to remote
working already. With that said, I took the job. :)</p>
<p>Of course not everything is rainbows and unicorns, as everything in life, but
the overall experience is really great. At this moment, I&rsquo;m writing this blog
post in the airplane (airplanes are the bad part :P), coming back from a trip
where I met 12 members of the team (we&rsquo;re 50+ at the moment) in two different
countries. I also was the person of contact for all hackers doing our challenge
at the HackUPC hackathon in Barcelona, which helped me a lot to collect feedback
of our APIs.</p>
<p>The whole thing about the &ldquo;love story&rdquo; I mentioned in the beginning of this
post is that Todoist helps me since the beginning of my career and now, after
almost 10 years, I have the change to work for the company behind it. What is
even greater is that the company has the same mindset and beliefs I have.</p>
<p>For this particular case, instead of using technology to retain talent, Doist
built the best product ever, which made me consider applying to make it even
better.</p>
