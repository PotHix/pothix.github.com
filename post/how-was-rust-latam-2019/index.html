<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a proud core organizer of the <a href="https://rustlatam.org">Rust
LATAM conference</a>. üéâ The conference happened
on March 29 and 30, and this post describes how it was to organize the
whole thing.</p>

<p>Even with the small problems we had (as any other big conference), the
feedback we received so far were very positive. We were able to bring
amazing speakers to the conference, which brought high-level content
even for beginners.</p>

<h2 id="organizers">Organizers</h2>

<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-organizersb.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-organizers.jpg" alt="All organizers in the corridor of our rented AirBnb place" title="Almost all Rust LATAM organizers" /></a></p>

<p>This post does not name people because I don&rsquo;t know how much they
feel comfortable to be mentioned here, but there&rsquo;s someone that
needs to be mentioned, and this person is <a href="https://twitter.com/spastorino">Santiago
Pastorino</a>. As the conference happened
in Montevideo (Uruguay), Santiago was the main organizer and main
contact to everything local to the place. He was the one doing the
heavy lifting for most of the things related to this conference, and he
has my full respect for that (and many other things).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we (other organizers) did some hard work too and I
would mention others by name. We joined in different stages of
the conference organization and committed ourselves in different
levels, Santiago was the only one who started it and was there until
we delivered it with the same level of commitment, that&rsquo;s why I
decided only to mention him by name.</p>

<p>I made some new friends while organizing this conference. It&rsquo;s great
to see how you become friends with someone after you spend some days
doing hard work and feeling the same pains and joys. At the end of the
conference, I felt I knew these people for years already, and it was
just 4-5 days working together. Of course, we had many interactions via
internet, but it didn&rsquo;t happen to all of them, and it was less
intense. I would say that the level of commitment to the same cause is
proportional to the bonding of the friendship.</p>

<h2 id="attendees">Attendees</h2>

<p>We generated a chart about the demographics using the data from
everyone who attended the conference. Here&rsquo;s the data we have for
that:</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-demographics.png"><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-demographics.png" alt="A pie chart showing the demographics of the conference" title="Demographics" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Errata:</strong> After the conference someone noticed that Mexico was not
included in the legend of the demographics chart when we presented in
the opening speech, so I&rsquo;m posting the right data now. It was my
fault, sorry Mexico! The Rust LATAM community loves you! üá≤üáΩ</p>

<p>60%+ of the participants were Uruguayans. We were expecting that
already since many of them were students. We did (Thanks Santiago!)
some presentations at local universities to promote the conference and
the language.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t have any problems with any of the attendees. Everyone
behaved as expected for the standards of the Rust community and I hope
many met some new friends to exchange information about Rust.</p>

<p>Rust still has a small community in LATAM, but we&rsquo;re trying to make it
better with this conference. :)</p>

<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>

<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-speakers.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-speakers.jpg" alt="All speakers and organizers on stage" title="Speakers" /></a></p>

<p>Here I&rsquo;m also counting the workshop speakers not only the ones who
were speaking on stage on Saturday.</p>

<p>In the end, everything ran smoothly with the speakers. One speaker was
not feeling well during the conference and we were worried about this
person and also for the possible slot e would have to fill but the
speaker was able to deliver the talk (which was great, BTW üòÅ).</p>

<p>All speakers performed great (even when Apple Keynote decides not to
cooperate üòú) thanks a lot to all of you that gave us your time and
knowledge to make this conference happen. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<h2 id="brazilians">Brazilians</h2>

<p>Yes, Brazilians deserve a topic. :)</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-brazilians.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-brazilians.jpg" alt="All brazilians on stage after the conference in a unofficial picture" title="Brazilians" /></a></p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know yet (for some reason), I&rsquo;m Brazilian. It&rsquo;s
not so common for people in Brazil to go to different countries (I may
be generalizing, but that&rsquo;s my feeling), mainly because Brazil is
so huge. I was amazed to see we had more people from Brazil than
people from Argentina there. üéâ</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a common thing to have this &ldquo;Brazil x Argentina&rdquo; thing (because
of soccer&hellip;), so I was joking about the number of participants. To be
honest, I was happy to see that we were considering each other as
fellow programmers of the Rust LATAM community and not people from
country X or Y.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="https://t.me/rustlangbr">Rust Brasil</a> chat on Telegram that
has 600+ members. There we have members from many different Brazilian
states; it&rsquo;s a place to unite all the local meetups like Rust-SP (S√£o
Paulo), Rust-BH (Minas Gerais), etc. It was the first time we had
a more significant meeting where people from different places could come to meet
and talk to other Brazilian Rustaceans. We had an internal joke that
it would be the first meeting of Rust Brasil&hellip;in Uruguay!</p>

<h2 id="what-went-well">What went well</h2>

<p>The whole conference went well. We feel that people are satisfied with
what we were able to deliver. We collected some feedback and the
general feeling was excellent.</p>

<p>It seems we were able to do everything on budget as well, so we didn&rsquo;t
have to spend our own [personal] money to deliver the conference and
help speakers and organizers to get to Uruguay. <strong>This was only
possible because we had amazing sponsors to help us with that. Thanks
Rust LATAM sponsors!</strong>.</p>

<p>We were able to deliver a pre-conference meetup, one day of workshops,
and one day of talks. Considering the size of the team and how busy we
were, it was almost a miracle (IMO). üéâ</p>

<p>The venue for the conference was great. We didn&rsquo;t have any problem at
all with it. <strong>Thanks a lot to Antel for providing it</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="problems-we-had-and-what-has-to-improve">Problems we had and What has to improve</h2>

<p>Of course, there were many problems. The simple ones, the complicated
ones, the funny ones, etc. We hope they were not apparent for the
participants and speakers. :)</p>

<h3 id="number-of-organizers-and-commitment">Number of organizers and commitment</h3>

<p>We had fewer organizers than we wanted to have. Some of us were able to
commit more than others, so we had to bring more people to the core
group of organizers. Some of us had to leave the group in the middle
of the process because they were too busy with other things; others
were there but not able to do much. This whole situation made
everything even more difficult.</p>

<p>Next time we should probably get more people and more commitment in
the beginning so it will be easier to afford losing people in the
process without overwhelming everyone.</p>

<h3 id="food-and-places">Food and places</h3>

<p>We had some problems related to food and the usage of one of the
workshops place. We paid for something and it was delivered in a
different way than what was agreed. There was probably some
miscommunication in the process, but it&rsquo;s hard to know how much of it
was on purpose or just unprofessional.</p>

<h3 id="intro-to-rust-workshop">Intro to Rust Workshop</h3>

<p>The initial plan was not to have any wokshop, but we were considering
having one done by us. In the end, we got awesome people to deliver
workshops, and we could have spared ours.</p>

<p>After some discussion, we thought it would be great to deliver
our workshop still because there were many students enrolled and it would be
a good thing for them. It proved to be accurate because it was the
biggest workshop we had.</p>

<p>The only problem is that it had to be delivered in Spanish and we had
just two native Spanish speakers organizers attending the
conference. Santiago became the responsible for the workshop.</p>

<p>The problem of having Santiago doing the workshop is that he was
already doing all the other things that needed someone from Uruguay
and didn&rsquo;t have enough time to work on it. We slept less than we
wanted and finished the whole slides and exercises together in the day
before (which reminded us of our university times! LOL).</p>

<p>We already had the content for the workshop, but now Santiago was
&ldquo;trapped into a room&rdquo; for the whole day. Many things were only known
by him (contracts, discussions by phone, etc.) because he was the one
dealing with locals. Well, in the end, he became the single point of
failure of the conference.</p>

<p>We managed to fix everything by covering him during the workshop
exercises but it was not an easy task to do.</p>

<p>It was great to have an <em>Intro to Rust</em> workshop, but we did not plan
it in the right way. Next time we will probably have someone other than
the main organizer doing that! LOL.</p>

<h2 id="backstage-stories">Backstage stories</h2>

<p>Well, we have some interesting stories from backstage to tell
you. üòÅ</p>

<h3 id="having-fun-with-the-language-mess">Having fun with the language mess</h3>

<p>It was hilarious to have Italian, English, Spanish, and Portuguese
all mixed up between the organizers and locals. We used English as the
lingua-franca between us (where&rsquo;s Esperanto? :P) but we also had to
deal with locals that only speak Spanish (venue, catering, etc.), so
we had to switch languages from time to time.</p>

<p>I remember when one of us was speaking Italian to the Spanish speaker
organizer by mistake. His face was: &ldquo;Why is he not understanding
me?&ldquo;. Very funny.</p>

<p>There was also one time when we were discussing the workshop (2 AM)
and the Spanish speaker read something in Spanish in an e-mail and
after that, this person made the switch to Spanish while we were
looking to him/her laughing and trying to understand what he was
talking about.</p>

<p>I have to say that I had <strong>a lot of fun</strong> with these situations :)</p>

<h3 id="lost-backpack">Lost backpack</h3>

<p>We were using a rideshare app to go from one place to another. We had
to bring boxes of t-shirts, bags, banners, and other things to the
place we were staying. You can imagine that the logistics were not easy.</p>

<p>In one of these rides, one of us took the boxes but forgot to get the
backpack from the car before leaving. We tried to contact the driver,
but it&rsquo;s not that easy to do that using this app in Uruguay.</p>

<p>When we finally could get an answer for the driver, he said that there
was no backpack there&hellip; That&rsquo;s nothing to do about it other than
report it to the police.</p>

<p>Well, it was awful for the organizer (and for the whole
conference organization), but it became even worse when we found that
this person&rsquo;s passport was also in the backpack. We started the
process of getting a new passport during the workshops day so him/her
would be able to get home in time. It&rsquo;s a long and stressful process.</p>

<h3 id="trapped-organizer">Trapped organizer</h3>

<p>One of us was out to bring the tablecloths for the sponsors&rsquo;
table. When this person got to the place, it was almost closing, and
he/she got trapped into the garage. One of us had to go there to
release him/her but this person was able to release [him/her]self
before we arrive. :P</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Organizing an international conference is tough. It took a
lot of my time in the past 3-4 months. There are so many details to
consider, and sometimes basic things you consider as done comes back to
bite you.</p>

<p>The feeling of accomplishing something that big with positive
feedback is something that you take for life. I&rsquo;m very proud of being
part of the team that made it happen.</p>

<p>Well&hellip; The best way to end this post is to thank everyone (attendees,
sponsors, speakers, organizers, etc.) who were there to make it
happen. ü¶Ä</p>
