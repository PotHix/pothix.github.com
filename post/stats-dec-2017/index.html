<p>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel
again this month. Let&rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.</p>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<p>I was traveling this month, so as usual, I&rsquo;m not reading/listening to
audiobooks because I prefer to focus on the place I&rsquo;m visiting. For
this reason, I did not finish any book this month.</p>

<p>With that said, it is the first time I have 4 books on my reading list
at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2EibMyt">Elixir in Action</a> is there for some time
now. I really like Elixir and want to finish it as soon as I have the
time. I&rsquo;m also playing with Rust nowadays, so I&rsquo;m
reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2FafTxv">Programming Rust</a> as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2CQn5Bz">The art of invisibility</a> is the current
audiobook and I hope to finish that as soon as I listen to all the
Podcast episodes piled since last
month.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2FcD6PU">Hiding in unnatural happiness</a> is a book I
received from a monk while in York. I&rsquo;m not in a rush with this one
but I want to finish soon, it&rsquo;s really small.</p>

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>

<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1296
946
</code></pre>

<p>It means I have <strong>1296 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>946 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1255 unread</strong>
and <strong>931 read</strong>), I got around <strong>1% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1%
more read articles</strong>.</p>

<p>My unread count is not growing so fast anymore and that is a good
thing.</p>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" /></a></p>

<p>Nothing new in this chart this month. The blank parts are related to
the New Year and Christmas holidays.</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" /></a></p>

<p><code>markdown</code> is usually the most used language because I write long texts in emacs before posting on <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>.
After that, we have Python and Rust! 😀</p>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" /></a></p>

<p>Just removed bash from the reports and now we have Emacs as the only editor being used (it&rsquo;s strange to not have any Vim this month) 🤔</p>

<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>

<p>No presentations this month. 😀</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations" /></a></p>

<p>I already reached all my goals for the year and was OK to not speak
during December. I admit that I tried to speak while I was in York
but could not find any local meetup to speak. :P</p>

<p>I had the chance to participate in two meetups
of <a href="https://www.yorkdevelopers.org/">York developers</a> but
unfortunately, there were no slots to speak.</p>

<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>

<p>This is the number of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month" /></a></p>

<p><strong>306 tasks</strong> completed this month (<strong>98 less</strong> than last month).</p>

<p>Many holidays and traveling in the last week of the year. I was
totally off and did not check my tasks in these days, this is why I
don&rsquo;t have many tasks done.</p>

<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>

<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" /></a></p>

<p><strong>1 day and 3 hours</strong> of podcast time. I decided to not listen to any
podcast while I was in York because I wanted to enjoy every single
moment while walking in the streets. I usually use Podcasts as a way
to escape from my boring routine in my working days but it was not
boring in York. 😀</p>

<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" /></a></p>

<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>

<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>

<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl" /></a></p>

<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and the full-time job. The
time doing freelance job was 0 hours this month, unfortunately.</p>

<p>We had 18 work days this month and I worked for 157 hours, which mean
that <strong>I worked 13 hours more than I should</strong>. From these 13 hours,
1:23 hours was in a Sunday but it was in the airplane so it doesn&rsquo;t
count :P.</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work" /></a></p>

<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meetings are stable. I usually have around 4-5 hours of meetings a month. One useful weekly meeting of around 40 min and one 1-1 meeting. If necessary I have small meetings to fix certain problems.</li>
<li>Hiring was <strong>really</strong> hard this month. Many interviews and candidates/test reviews.</li>
<li>Shallow work is still consuming around 60% of my tasks (I&rsquo;m not counting Hiring as shallow work, BTW)</li>
</ul>

<p>This time I have a list of what I was doing with my <em>Shallow
work</em>. Most of the time I can&rsquo;t describe what was it but I know part
of it is my lunch time.</p>

<p>One of the things I can spot as a time consumer here is the
&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo;. As we are committed to meaningful communication, I
tend to read most of the messages that mention me somehow and some of
them are big threads discussing some important problem. It makes sense
to take some time but I would like to improve it. Maybe next month 😉</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" /></a></p>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, no personal projects this month. 😞
It&rsquo;s kinda sad that I had not personal projects or freelancing this month. I really like to spend some time working on different projects.</p>

<p>I think it happened for a reason: I was in a different city/country
and invested all my time in my full-time job and walking around the
city. I will try to keep that in my mind. 😀</p>

<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" /></a></p>

<p>As expected, I don&rsquo;t have enough data because I changed my browser
for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox Quantum</a> and forgot
to install the rescuetime extension. Shame on me. 😞</p>

<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" /></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity-comparison.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity_comparison.jpg" alt="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" /></a></p>

<p>An average of <strong>10k</strong> steps is good for me. It was better than
November but worse than October, which was expected.</p>

<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month" /></a></p>

<p>My max distance was <strong>17.3km</strong> walking in one day (I was lucky to get
the tooltip to work when taking the screenshot):</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month" /></a></p>

<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month" /></a></p>

<p>As we can see in the chart, I had more minutes of average sleeping
this month (<strong>7h38m</strong> for the last month) but less deep sleeping (last
month was <strong>1h44</strong>) 😢</p>

<p>Considering the whole user base from mi-band:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" alt="Sleep comparison with the user base" title="Sleep comparison with the user base" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m below average regarding sleeping earlier and on average regarding
deep sleeping.</p>

<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 1
episode this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" /></a></p>

<p>It was probably <strong>Billions</strong> when I got home. 😀</p>

<p>I spent <strong>1 hour</strong> of my life watching TV shows this month. Not bad 😉.</p>

<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>

<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>93129</strong> words written (<strong>71062</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>1380</strong> corrections made (<strong>1091</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>11979</strong> unique words (<strong>17429</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote a lot this month. Almost 20k words more than last month but I
also made more mistakes, almost in the same proportions. My vocabulary
did not increase in the same rhythm though.</p>

<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>

<p>New cities were added this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png" alt="New cities" title="New cities" /></a></p>

<p>The missing city is Durham.</p>

<p>Here are the general data:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really weird that some countries are disappearing. 😞 Last month
I had 7 countries but now I have 6 again. I
used
<a href="https://matadornetwork.com/travel-map/22396bbf7ad1af6c0d8758cb54077e13-1515270907">Matador network</a> to
track the countries and I visited <strong>8 countries, not 6</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png" alt="Countries map" title="Countries map" /></a></p>

<p>Not so useful, but here is the time spent on vehicles:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably the time spent in taxis from home to the airport and
also related to the trip we made in North Yorkshire by van.</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon" /></a></p>

<p>This trip removed 12k km from my distance to the moon. 👍</p>

<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>

<p>My expenses for this month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month" /></a></p>

<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. Yes! You read
that right, I finally received some freaking money after six months! 🎉</p>

<p>This money is still not related to my current job but I already
received my payment, just need to go through the bureaucracy to be
able to pay the taxes and receive that in my personal account.</p>

<p>I will definitely write about this whole process soon.</p>

<p>This month is finally back to normal! My total savings <strong>increased by
1.9%</strong> and now I have <strong>75.10%</strong> of my goal.</p>

<p>Next month will be <strong>huge!</strong></p>

<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>

<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>

<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 02 minutes to write this post</strong></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m back to Brazil after one full month working
from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982">York</a>. I have to say that it
was really great to work from a different place for some time.</p>

<p>This was the last month of the year so expect a yearly review from me
soon. 😀</p>

                            I've added three different RSS feeds here based on categories. The idea was to help you the tech guy that don't want to see what kind of motorcycle I have, or the english speaker that don't want to see portuguese posts on his feed reader.
                            <br /><br />
                            So, I have a feed for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix">all my posts</a>, for the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix">English posts</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech">Tech related posts</a>. Choose one and be happy! :)
