                <p><a href="https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br"><img src="/images/writing/desconstruindoaweb_book.jpg" alt="desconstruindo a web"></a></p>
<p>I wrote desconstruindo a web in 2016 and my goal was to help web developers to
understand the whole cycle of their application, from the initial keystroke to
the loaded page.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand all the pieces involved in a web request so we can
better debug problems happening in this process. The internet is a complex
system and many parts can fail, knowing the purpose of each is quite useful
when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>The whole writing process (research, drawing, writing, publishing, etc.) took
me 315 houurs. I wrote about this process <a href="/desconstruindoaweb">here</a> in pt-BR
(with automatic translation to English).</p>
<p>At the moment of this writing, this book bought by almost 1500 people and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/27871094?sort=num_ratings">has
the highest review between the books of my publisher with more than 50
reviews</a> (5
star average with 1 review doesn&rsquo;t count ðŸ˜›), which makes me quite happy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reviewer-for-other-books">Reviewer for other books</h2>
<p>I love writing and I&rsquo;m involved in other books and articles other than my own
book and this blog. I will list ome of them here.</p>
<h3 id="rust-book-main-tech-reviewer">Rust book: Main tech reviewer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-rust"><img src="/images/writing/rust_book.jpg" alt="Rust book"></a></p>
<p>I was the main tech reviewer for the Rust book, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/mfcastellani">Marcelo
Castellani</a>. I had the chance to co-write
this book with him but I didn&rsquo;t have the time to dedicate to the project, so I
just did the technical review. The book is great for those who want a simple
and easy-to-read Rust book in pt-BR.</p>
<h3 id="rails-book-one-of-the-tech-reviewers">Rails book: One of the tech reviewers</h3>
<p><img src="/images/writing/rubyonrails_book.jpg" alt="book"></p>
<p>I was one of the tech reviewers for this book in 2012. The book was written by
<a href="https://twitter.com/vinibaggio">Vinicius Baggio</a> using Rails 3. It was being
sold there for many years but did not receive many updates, which cause it to
be removed from the store in 2018 approximately.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-web-book-one-of-the-book-reviewers">Semantic web book: One of the book reviewers</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-web-semantica"><img src="/images/writing/websemantica_book.jpg" alt="book"></a></p>
<p>I was one of the reviewers for this book written by <a href="https://diegoeis.com">Diego
Eis</a>. I&rsquo;m not a tech reviewer here because semantic web
is not a topic I&rsquo;m deeply experienced with, but I was able to contribute with
book writing experience and didactics.</p>
<h3 id="html-game-development-hotshot-one-of-the-tech-reviewers">HTML game development hotshot: One of the tech reviewers</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/html5-game-development-hotshot"><img src="/images/writing/html5_book.jpg" alt="book"></a></p>
<p>I was approached by PacketPub to review this book as a HTML5 game development
specialist when I was working on my HTML5 games. The book is written by
<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/makzan">Makzan</a> and uses CreateJS
to show HTML5 game development in practice.</p>
<h2 id="articles-published-outside-of-this-blog">Articles published outside of this blog</h2>
<p>I was also invited to write articles for other blogs which I respect and/or
have a good reach. I will list here some of them.</p>
<h3 id="the-game-loop-gamedev-tuts">The game loop: Gamedev tuts+</h3>
<p><a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/gamedev-glossary-what-is-the-game-loop--gamedev-2469"><img src="/images/writing/gameloop_article.jpg" alt="book"></a></p>
<p>An article that explains how the Game loop works in game development. It was
written for gamedev.tutsplus.com in Nov 2012.</p>
<h3 id="client-side-prediction-gamedev-tuts">Client side prediction: Gamedev tuts+</h3>
<p><a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/gamedev-glossary-what-is-client-side-prediction--gamedev-3849"><img src="/images/writing/clientsideprediction_article.jpg" alt="book"></a></p>
<p>Article that explains how client side pretiction works in game development.
Wrote for gamedev.tutsplus.com in Jan 2013.</p>
<h3 id="audiobooks-locaweb-blog">Audiobooks: Locaweb blog</h3>

    <img src="/images/writing/audiobooks_article.png"  alt="audiobooks"  class="center"  />


<p>A pt-BR article about how audiobooks can change your &ldquo;reading&rdquo; life forever.
It&rsquo;s mostly what I&rsquo;ve written <a href="/audiobooks">here</a> too.</p>
<h3 id="quantified-self-doist-blog--quartz-at-work">Quantified self: Doist blog + Quartz at work</h3>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/work/1431910/mostly-free-tools-to-track-almost-every-area-of-your-life/"><img src="/images/writing/quantified_article.jpg" alt="book"></a></p>
<p>I used all the my knowledge tracking myself for more than one year to write
down all the tools available to use for those who want to quantify themselves.</p>
<p>This post was originally posted at the Doist blog and then at Quartz at work.</p>
