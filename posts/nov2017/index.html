      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel
again this month. Let&rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft,
called <a href="http://amzn.to/2AO5IPW">At the mountains of madness</a> was one
of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read
about <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqZG2h">minimalism</a> just to realize that I&rsquo;m a
minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to
listen to their <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/podcast/">podcast</a> and
read their website.</p>
<p>The last book is <a href="http://amzn.to/2Ath5tX">On power</a> which was probably
the worst book this year. It was so small that I could finish but I
can&rsquo;t say that I learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>I also started
reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2nrzm8p">The Rust Programming language</a>
because I&rsquo;m playing with Rust a little bit. I still want to
finish <a href="http://amzn.to/2ztCDZU">Elixir in Action</a> but it will take a
while.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1255
931
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1255 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>931 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1230 unread</strong>
and <strong>905 read</strong>), I got around <strong>1.7% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>Almost the same growth of the last month. For me, it means that it was
a good thing to check my Feedly once a week but that doesn&rsquo;t change
the number of articles I read and it&rsquo;s probably the new delicious.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>The empty days are related to a holiday in Brazil and a huge amount of technical tickets and support for our APIs during that week. It was the price for the focused work in the week before. :)</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p><code>markdown</code> is usually the most used language because I write long texts in emacs before posting on <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>. I removed the <code>bash</code> plugin from my terminal in the middle of the month so that 38% doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. And then&hellip; <strong>Rust</strong>! It was a fun week.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new here. Emacs at the top, bash being removed and Vim.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desconstruindo a web</strong> at <a href="http://www.codus.com.br/">Codus</a> tech-talks</li>
<li><strong>Desconstruindo a web - Sua app ruby end to end</strong> at <a href="http://www.totvstechday.io/">TOTVS Tech day</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the chart comparing to my goal for this year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>My first goal was to speak 19 times with 1 international talk and I
reached. After reaching the first goal I set a new goal: reach <strong>25
talks this year</strong> and I just met it. Speak 25 times in one year is
more than I could have ever imagined. Now it&rsquo;s time to take a break
and enjoy the last month of the year. :)</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>This is the number of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>404 tasks</strong> completed this month (<strong>17 more</strong> than last month).</p>
<p>This time I have some other colors on the chart. It&rsquo;s related to
internal Todoist projects but most part of it is still personal (red)
and work-related (blue).</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days and 13 hours</strong> of podcast time, just 4 hours more than last month. It means that I spent a lot of time listening to Podcasts again.</p>
<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and the full-time job. Not so much time as a freelancer, though. I decided to do a deep down about the time I spent working for my full-time employee this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-doist.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-doist.png" alt="Hours working for at Doist" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>We had 20 work days in Brazil this month and I worked for 189 hours, which mean that <strong>I worked 30 hours more than I should</strong>. According to this data, almost 5 of those hours were on the weekends/holidays. I should really improve that.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings are stable. I usually have around 4-5 hours of meetings a month. One useful weekly meeting of around 40 min and one 1-1 meeting. If necessary I have small meetings to fix certain problems.</li>
<li>Hiring is taking some time. Interviewing, looking for candidates and writing down my opinions take some time</li>
<li>Shallow work is still consuming around 65% of my tasks. I&rsquo;m trying to describe the tasks better so I can understand what I&rsquo;m considering shallow work. Maybe I will have something next month.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>It is related to my two talks and my participation in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXu-kJE_H4">hangout by Farol Digital</a>. I&rsquo;m still not producing a lot of content but it&rsquo;s an improvement.</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>I changed my browser for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox Quantum</a>
but forgot to install the rescuetime extension, so I don&rsquo;t have enough detailed
data. It will be the same (or worst) for the next month.</p>
<p>Here are the big offenders:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png" alt="Offesors of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Offenders of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>I just changed Twist to <code>productive</code> instead of <code>distracting</code>. I&rsquo;m not
sure if Twist deserves to be distracting because we usually talk about
work there and it&rsquo;s not so distracting. With that said, Twist still
takes a big portion of my time due to the need for communication. It&rsquo;s
the source of all conversations at Doist, but it&rsquo;s up to us to not
make communication overwhelming. I&rsquo;m still working to have the balance
between communication and &ldquo;real work&rdquo;, let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
<strong>6.3k</strong> steps (190625/30). It was kinda disappointing as it&rsquo;s below my
average. I will work on it for the next month. :)</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>8.4km</strong> walking in one day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Some more minutes of average sleeping (<strong>7h31m</strong> for the last month)
but also less deep sleeping (last month was <strong>1h58</strong>) 😢</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 36
episodes this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>This month we finished <strong>Orphan Black (season 4 and 5)</strong> and started <strong>Billions</strong>.</p>
<p>I spent <strong>1 day and 3 hours</strong> of my life watching TV shows this month.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>71062</strong> words written (in September it was <strong>73969</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>1091</strong> corrections made (in September it was <strong>1826</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>17429</strong> unique words (in September it was <strong>17139</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m comparing to September because October was not a typical month. I had fewer words written but I can see that I had fewer corrections made and more unique words! That makes me feel good. 😁</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>At the end of the month, I went to York (the old York, in England, not the New York, in the USA) to work from there for 1 month. So, a new country was added:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-countries.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-countries.png" alt="New countries" title="New countries"></a></p>
<p>I think it was actually part of the list from when I visited London but it&rsquo;s worth posting. The city of York was also added:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-cities.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-cities.png" alt="New cities" title="New cities"></a></p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>One new city and 16 new places.</p>
<p>Not so useful, but here is the time spent on vehicles:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the time spent in the taxi to the airport and in the bus from Manchester to Leeds and York.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<p>This trip removed 11k km from my distance to the moon. 👍</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described <a href="/post/stats-jul-2017">in</a> <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">the</a> <a href="/post/stats-aug-2017">last</a> <a href="/post/stats-sep-2017">five</a> <a href="/post/stats-oct-2017">months</a> still
persists, for this reason, there&rsquo;s no money coming yet. :(</p>
<p>This month I finally had some good news and the process is almost done, just waiting for the final document. Hope to have something to show next month.</p>
<p>And again&hellip; If you&rsquo;re reading this every month, you already know that
my wife is paying all of our bills until my situation gets back to
normal and I&rsquo;m really glad to have someone to rely on when things like
these happen. ❤</p>
<p>This month is back to normal and my wife helped to keep our expenses
in a good shape. My total savings <strong>increased by 0.6%</strong> and now I have
<strong>73.70%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 30 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Just came back from a trip last month to prepare to travel again this
month. I&rsquo;m writing this post from the winter
of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982">York</a>, it&rsquo;s -1 Celsius but feels
like -7. I worked a lot this month but it enabled me to keep my
work on schedule for the travel so I think it worth it.</p>
<p>I did not receive any money yet but everything is moving forward
now and I hope to have a nice December with everything set up. :)</p>
