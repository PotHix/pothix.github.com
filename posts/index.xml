            <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a keyboard that would be great to take with me when I&amp;rsquo;m not working from home for some days. I finally found the Iris keyboard that seems to be exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.
The need I currently have a Kinesis Advantage at home. The keyboard is great, probably the best keyboard I used so far, but it&amp;rsquo;s far from what we can call portable 😅.</description>

with me when I&rsquo;m not working from home for some days. I finally found the Iris
keyboard that seems to be exactly what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<h2 id="the-need">The need</h2>
<p>I currently have a Kinesis Advantage at home. The keyboard is great, probably
the best keyboard I used so far, but it&rsquo;s far from what we can call portable
😅. I needed a keyboard I could take with me when I wanted, so I started a
quest to find it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I bought a <a href="http://www.typematrix.com/2030/features.php">typematrix keyboard</a>
but it was not good enough (not even mechanical).</li>
<li>I had a <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Lite">HHKB Lite</a> but I wanted a
mechanical keyboard (it uses rubber dome).</li>
<li>I bought a
<a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&amp;c=165">Pok3r</a>
keyboard but it was too heavy for what I wanted.</li>
<li>I bought an <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus keyboard</a> but found that
a 40% layout was too small for my needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I found the <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard">Iris
keyboard</a>,
which seems to be the perfect size between the Atreus and Kinesis keyboards.
The problem is that it&rsquo;s a DIY keyboard and I had zero experience with anything
electronic.</p>
<p>Talking to some friends I found that the Iris is the easy mode of DIY
keyboards, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="pieces-and-prices">Pieces and prices</h2>
<p>I had to buy the following pieces to be able to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S18VCDN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">DSA Keycaps</a>: $23.50</li>
<li>5 x <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N45BWC3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Cherry MX Clear Keyswitch (10 pack)</a>: $50</li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-case-plates?variant=7472218210334">Iris Keyboard - Case/Plates</a>: $27.99</li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard?variant=29480467267678">Iris Keyboard - PCBs for Split Ergonomic Keyboard</a>: $59.99</li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://keeb.io/account/orders/25478d0d3478d5aa26c647de49310efd">TRRS Cable - Black Coiled</a>: $7.98</li>
<li>Shipping costs: $6.10 (keeb.io) + $30 to ship it to Brazil (the final value is R$125 in my local currency)</li>
<li>1 Multimeter: R$37,00</li>
<li>1 Soldering kit (soldering iron, desoldering pump, soldering iron stand, tin wire tube): R$88,00</li>
<li>Acrylic Middle layers: $30.00 (bought after the keyboard was assembled as it&rsquo;s optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sum is about $234.60 + R$125,00 (~30 USD). I believe I spent around <strong>280
USD</strong> to build the keyboard. In my local currency, using the current
conversion (it may have been different when I first bought the needed
components), it&rsquo;s around <strong>R$1400,00</strong>.</p>
<p>I had some credits on Amazon and the currency was not that bad at the time. The
effective value considering the credits was about R$800,00 which is still
almost 4/5 of the minimum wage here in Brazil.</p>
<h2 id="assembling">Assembling</h2>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/initial.jpg" alt="A laptop, PCB, soldering iron, keycaps, and switches on the table" title="Ready to start"></p>
<p>Again, I would like to mention that I had 0 experience with anything
electronic, so it was a amazing how noob I was. :)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/first-soldering.jpg" alt="Soldering on a switch pin in the PCB" title="My first soldering, not very good"></p>
<p>This was my first soldering. Not something I&rsquo;m proud of but something I laugh
about today.</p>
<p>A friend of mine recommended me to use a fan to avoid inhaling the melted tin,
so I was doing that. It just took me a while to realize that my fan was
actually cooling the tin and the soldering iron making the whole process harder
to do. If this is your case, be careful with your fan.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/corner-switches.jpg" alt="A PCB with four switches mounted" title="Starting with the four corners"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s recommended to first do the soldering for the corner switches so it&rsquo;s easy
to change anything in case the position is wrong somehow.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/testing-all-switches.jpg" alt="A laptop, a notebook with a drawing of the keyboard layout, and the PCB connected to the laptop" title="Testing connections with a tweezer"></p>
<p>I first checked if all the connections for the switches were working correcly.
I just used a tweezer to close the connection and get the signal on <code>xev</code>. Keep
in mind that the <code>fn</code> keys do not emit any signal and it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not
working. 😉</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/testing-the-mount.jpg" alt="The PCB with 4 switches mounted. Three brown and one purple" title="Initial mount just to be sure everything is in place"></p>
<p>The four switches were soldered and I did the initia mounting to be sure
everything is in place. I&rsquo;m using brown switches for almost all keys, except
the modifiers where I&rsquo;m using outemu purple switches.</p>
<p>It seems like a planned change but I did that to avoid buying another set of
switches and a friend (thanks rhruiz!) kindly gave me these outemu purple to
complete my set.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/mounting-all-switches.jpg" alt="A PCB with half of the switches already inserted. Most of them are brown but there&rsquo;s also 4 purple" title="Inserting all switches"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to insert all switches.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/soldering-process.jpg" alt="macro picture of the PCB to show the soldering" title="Soldering one by one"></p>
<p>Soldering time! The soldering is not great but it&rsquo;s the best I could do on my first attempt. :)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/all-soldering-done.jpg" alt="A picture of the PCB with all its soldering points" title="Soldering done"></p>
<p>The left side is done!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/testing-on-xev.jpg" alt="The left side of the keyboard turned on with red LED. The laptop in the background running xev on the termimal" title="Testing all switches using xev"></p>
<p>Testing all the switches using <code>xev</code> just to be sure the soldering is working (spoiler: it is!)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/other-side.jpg" alt="The right side PCB upside down right below the completed left part of the keyborad. Laptop in the background" title="Soldering the other side"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to do the soldering on the right side. Same process.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/keycaps.jpg" alt="Both sides of the keyboard side by side and some keycaps already inserted" title="Adding the keycaps"></p>
<p>Now that everything is in place, let&rsquo;s add the keycaps.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/v0-done-fixing-bugs.jpg" alt="The laptop running xev on top, a notebook with a pen to highlight faulty keys on a drawing and the full keyboard running on the side" title="Finished the initial version and testing everything again to find problems"></p>
<p>Here it is! The first version is done! 🎉</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected that some keys will stop working after adding the keycaps,
especially in my case since my soldering skills are not good.  I went one by
one and found some malfunctioning keys, so it&rsquo;s time to get back to soldering.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/done.jpg" alt="The laptop running Vim with the text &ldquo;DONE!&rdquo; written. The completed keyboard with red LEDs below" title="Problems fixed, all done!"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Everything done for now and the keyboard is usable already!</p>
<p><em>PS: <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOEfqRQ-V2aVWYO1ENs4xrMADgwfMQM36D0hgdGdv1kW8T04pNHui4JX3UffsHO9A?key=WnJ1YXhNTERaTnhNNFVDQnh2enA3ekd6ZjlTZVN3">Here</a> is the album with all pictures I took while assembling the keyboard.</em> 😉</p>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>At some point I started having some weird behaviors like this &ldquo;heaven and hell&rdquo; LEDs:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/heaven-and-hell.jpg" alt="The laptop mounted on a Roost stand and the keyboard below. One side with right LEDs and the other with blue LEDs" title="It was a nice bug, I actually liked this coloring LOL"></p>
<p>And after some time the keyboard just got disconnected with a yellow LED light:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/yellow-light.jpg" alt="The laptop mounted on a Roost stand and the keyboard below. The keyboard showing an yellow LED color" title="This is a bad color for sure :("></p>
<p>After disconnecting, the keyboad was not responding anymore. No LEDs, no
<code>dmesg</code> message or anything. :(</p>
<p>I used the multimeter to do some basic continuity tests (thanks for the
guidance <a href="https://twitter.com/rhruiz">@rhruiz</a>) but found not short circuit or
anything like that. After some time and a RESET while plugged, the keyboard went
back to life, showing itself again on <code>dmesg</code>.</p>
<p>I saw a <code>dmesg</code> message complaining about the USB cabe and we (me and rhruiz)
have a feeling the max brightness on both sides was too much too handle. 🤔</p>
<p>After all of that, the keyboard was reborn and baptized as Telperion:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/telperion.jpg" alt="The keyboard with a blue/white LED lighting" title="Welcome back to life, Telperion!"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that DIY keyboard will certainly require some
sort of maintenance from time to time. This is especially true if it&rsquo;s your
first keyboard (as it&rsquo;s mine!) because your soldering may not be the best and
it will require some small resoldering fix after some time.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-the-firmware">Customizing the firmware</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/">qmk firmware
repository</a>. I suggest forking it and
cloning your own fork since you will probably change it. 😉</p>
<p>After cloning the repository, you have to install the software needed to
compile and flash the firmware. There are two (maybe more) ways to do that:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can use docker via <code>util/docker_build.sh</code> script. It would be something
like: <code>util/docker_build.sh keebio/iris/rev4:default:flash</code></li>
<li>You can install all the tools locally via <code>util/qmk_install.sh</code> and flash
with <code>make keebio/iris/rev4:default:flash</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I would love to use the option 1 but for some reason docker cannot find the
keyboard via USB and I had to install the tooling locally. I suggest you to
start trying docker and if it didn&rsquo;t work, go for option 2.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-your-own-keymap">Compiling your own keymap</h3>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/PotHix/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps/pothix">created my own keymap inside my
fork</a>
so it would be easy to keep the main code updated. So I have to use the following command to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>make keebio/iris/rev4:pothix
</code></pre><p>If everything goes right, I just can just flash it.</p>
<p>Connect the keyboard to the USB port and hit the RESET button. It may be via
RESET button at the back of the keyboard of actually hitting the RESET key on
the &ldquo;LOWER&rdquo; layer (check the default keymap for more info).</p>
<p>After that, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo make keebio/iris/rev4:pothix:flash
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;m not able to flash it without sudo, so keep it in mind when flashing.</p>
<p>Remember to flash both sides because you may get incompatibilities and weird
behaviors sometimes. Here is one I had:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/iris-rev4/flash-both-sides.jpg" alt="The keyboard with a blue/white LEDs on the left side and a red+blue on the right side. The right side seems to be malfunctioning." title="The right side is totally messed up!"></p>
<h3 id="optimizing">Optimizing</h3>
<p>Depending on what you&rsquo;re using on your keyboard, you may exceed the maximum
size for the binary. If this is the case for you (as it was for me :P), you can
start disabling features you&rsquo;re not using.</p>
<p><a href="https://thomasbaart.nl/2018/12/01/reducing-firmware-size-in-qmk/">This
article</a> was
very helpful for me to understand what can be done. If you want some examples,
check my
<a href="https://github.com/PotHix/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps/pothix/rules.mk">rules.mk</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/PotHix/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps/pothix/config.h">config.h</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not cheaper to build your own keyboard as one would expect, but it&rsquo;s
definitely fun if you want to get your hands dirty with soldering to build
something custom for yourself. I learned a lot in the process and I hope to be
able to maybe build another keyboard in the future.</p>
<p>It will probably not be the last keyboard I will build. I still want to build a
<a href="https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc">dactyl-cc</a> at some point to take the
place of my current Kinesis Advantage. It&rsquo;s a handwired keyboard, so I will
have to move to the hard version of keyboard assembling. :)</p>
<p>Happy keyboard building! ⌨</p>

            <description>Brace yourselves, like any other stats post, this one will be HUGE
My year in review for 2018 was never posted because I could never finish it. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to let the same thing happen this year, so here I am.
The end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was quite hard for me and me just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to sit down in front of the computer during the weekends to write my monthly reviews.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Brace yourselves, like any other stats post, this one will be HUGE</strong></p>
<p>My year in review for 2018 was never posted because I could never finish it. I
don&rsquo;t want to let the same thing happen this year, so here I am.</p>
<p>The end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was quite hard for me and me just
didn&rsquo;t have the energy to sit down in front of the computer during the weekends
to write my monthly reviews.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/blog-stats-failed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/blog-stats-failed.png" alt="A list of files on a terminal showing 4 different unfinished posts" title="Failed attempts to write my stats posts"></a></p>
<p>Some people still ask me to get back to write such reviews, but I couldn&rsquo;t make
this a priority for myself anymore. I don&rsquo;t want the same to happen to my Year
in review. I do it for many years already and I plan to keep doing it for a long
time. So <strong>let&rsquo;s start</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="average-day">Average day</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what an average day is to me according to <a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix">Exist.io</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/exist-average-day.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/exist-average-day.png" alt="A list of data showing how a day works. Starts with a sleep of 7 hours and a half, 3 hours and a half of productive time, 11 tracks, 1 tweet, 2 hours of distracting time, almost 9 thousand steps, an average of 4 for my rating and going to sleep at 11h30" title="My day according to Exist"></a></p>
<p>This is almost a TL;DR of this post, but there&rsquo;s a lot of details missing here and we will cover them topic by topic. 😉</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads-year-in-books-logo.png" alt="Year in books from Goodreads. Shows &ldquo;On the shortness of life&rdquo; as the shortest book and &ldquo;Homo Deus&rdquo; as the longest one. &ldquo;The power of habit&rdquo; is the most popular book. I read 6291 pages across 25 books this year" title="My year in books by Goodreads"></a></p>
<p>Although I did not meet my goal of 30 books read this year, I still consider
the 25 books read an achievement.</p>
<p>At some point, I realized I was choosing my books to meet the goal. When picking
a new book from my wishlist, I was choosing the smallest ones first, not
necessarily the ones I wanted to read the most. It&rsquo;s not that bad, as I was
still choosing books from my library and wish list, but I don&rsquo;t want to have
such influence in the titles I pick.</p>
<p>25 books is a great mark IMO. You can see my 2019 Goodreads challenge
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge">here</a>. :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still using <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google keep</a> to take notes of all the
books I read and I&rsquo;m posting Goodreads reviews for them based on these notes.
You can see the reviews for 2019 by clicking each book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14901302">on my Goodreads
page</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the books from this year&rsquo;s list that I really recommend
reading, with links to my review:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435182291">Why We Sleep</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055385130">Homo Deus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1559101465">The Power of Habit</a> (second time I read this one)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2606595802">Atomic Habits</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some from 2018 since I did not post my Year in review last
year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2254843906">When</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2479523573">Principles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can always look for my whole
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2019">list of books read in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2018">2018</a> on Goodreads.</p>
<p>Here are some stats provided by Goodreads comparing all the books I
have registered:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads.png" alt="A list by year with progress bars. The biggest one is from 2017, the second is 2018, and 2019 is the third one most filled" title="List of books read by year"></a></p>
<p>I started <a href="/post/audiobooks/">listening to audiobooks</a> in 2016 and we can
clearly see how excited I was. 😅 I can see now that I&rsquo;m reducing the number of
books I&rsquo;m reading every year, but I don&rsquo;t think I should be concerned about that.
The number should not surpass the quality of books and how much I&rsquo;m applying
what I learn.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the books I read this year with last year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads-details.png" alt="The years of 2019, 2018, and 2017 and their book ratings by me" title="Comparison between 2017, 2018, and 2019"></a></p>
<p>I used the number of pages because it clearly shows that I even read more than
2018, but not more individual books. I was not expecting that but it shows that
I was trying to be less focused on the number of books.</p>
<p>In 2017, I mentioned that I was disappointed with the number of 5 stars I gave.
It was probably related to the fact that I was buying cheaper books and
focusing on smaller ones as well. In 2018, I tried to fix that and it works.
I gave <strong>7 five stars reviews</strong> in 2018 and <strong>five</strong> in 2019. It seems these
metrics were useful after all. :)</p>
<p>In 2018, I read 2 books from my &ldquo;audible-deal&rdquo; shelf and in 2019 I read none.
From all the books I have on my &ldquo;audible-deal&rdquo;, none of them were 5 stars. This
is probably a bad sign. On the other hand, I found some great books there and I
don&rsquo;t regret reading them
(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1968545292">Spaceman</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2057742804">Rendezvous with
Rama</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055058923">What Doesn&rsquo;t Kill
Us</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>I was not feeling so good about the number of books I read this year, but after
writing this section I&rsquo;m feeling much better. I&rsquo;m happy with my results here. :)</p>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t finish my year in review for 2018, but the part about articles was
done, fortunately. There&rsquo;s no way to get the read date from Pocket, so if I
want to collect it, I have to do it from time to time. Thanks, past self! It was
not in vain after all. If you&rsquo;re reading this, I was successful in publishing
this time, so this is good news. 🤞</p>
<p>Different from <a href="post/2017-year-in-review/">the review I did for 2017</a>, I will
now have data for the full year. I will also mention the data I had for 2018,
since they were collected but never published.</p>
<p>In 2018, I had <strong>1733 articles unread (22% increase compared to 2017) and 1456
articles read (31% increase compared to 2017)</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2019, I have <strong>1908 articles unread (9% increase comparing to 2018) and 1731
articles read (16% increase compared to 2018)</strong>.</p>
<p>It means that <strong>I read 275 articles this year</strong>. It&rsquo;s a bit worse than 2018
when I read 381, but it&rsquo;s still a good number IMO. It&rsquo;s an average of <strong>23
articles each month</strong>.  Again, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that I&rsquo;m aware that I will
probably never read all those 1908 articles left in my Pocket account and I&rsquo;m
OK with that.</p>
<p>I was expecting to have more data from
<a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix">Exist.io</a> regarding articles this year,
but unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing to not have much. They provided a
year in review, which I&rsquo;m going to mention later, but the only thing about
articles is that <strong>it says I read 263</strong>, which is quite close to the number I
had above. :)</p>
<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
<p>All my coding metrics are provided by
<a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>. When we have a light blue bar inside
a dark blue one, it means the light one is the global average and the dark one
is the top coder. We should usually focus on the <strong>light blue part of the bar</strong>.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the total time coding:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png" alt="Coding stats for this year. I logged 313 hours and my best day was March 21" title="Total time coding this year"></a></p>
<p>My daily average this year is even lower than the 1h31 per day I got in 2017,
which looks really low for me. I&rsquo;m still above the average, but 47 mins on
average is a bit weird. 😐</p>
<p>I remember the official Wakatime profile <a href="post/2017-year-in-review/">added a comment to my 2017
post</a> to mention that it may be related to the way
Wakatime records the numbers. I remember tweaking things a bit but I&rsquo;m not sure
if I should increase the numbers to have unrealistic reports. Maybe I should
try to tweak the data collection once again.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png" alt="Three projects followed by their progress bars" title="Total time coding by project this year"></a></p>
<p>I dedicated only 22 hours to this blog, compared to 80+ hours in 2017. I would
like to improve this, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it will be a priority, unfortunately.</p>
<p><a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> is my top project for this year, which is
expected since it&rsquo;s my main job. I expected to have more time tracked there,
but I&rsquo;m not only coding for the main Todoist repository, so it makes sense. I
hope to also have <a href="https://twist.com">Twist</a> as a relevant project on my list
of projects next year, or at least have integrations related to it.</p>
<p>I still keep the same freelance job I have for more than 4 years now. It became
almost a personal project for me. The good part of working for them is that the
work is just coding and mostly fixing bugs. I just need to sit down and write some
code.</p>
<p>This year was totally atypical since I took some time to migrate the framework
and infrastructure of this project. It was a big challenge, especially for
someone working using their spare time for that. I expect the number of hours
working on this project to totally shrink in 2020. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png" alt="Total time by OS and editors. The top coder has a very big progress bar while mine is 20% of that" title="Total time coding by editor and OS this year"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just using Linux, so it&rsquo;s expected to have it here. I&rsquo;m using it much more
than the average as we can see. The &ldquo;top coder&rdquo; is an outlier for sure. 😜</p>
<p>In 2017, I wrote: <em>Looks like I fully switched to Emacs</em>. It seems things have changed again. I&rsquo;m back to Vim now. 🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png" alt="A list of 4 languages along with their progress bars. Dark blue is very long and light blue very small" title="Total time coding by language this year"></a></p>
<p>Markdown is still in this list for the same reasons I had in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>I still write posts on my blog using Markdown</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m responsible for <a href="https://developer.todoist.com">Todoist</a>
and <a href="https://developer.twistapp.com">Twist</a> documentation</li>
<li>I usually write a long post in Emacs/Vim and then paste them to Twist</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s no surprise that <strong>Python</strong> is the language I used the most this year,
since we use Python for almost everything at <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>.</p>
<p>I use Ruby at my freelance job, so there&rsquo;s no surprise to still have it there.</p>
<p>In 2017, I mentioned that <em>I don&rsquo;t think I will have enough ground to play with
Elixir this year but maybe Rust will have his time in my schedule in 2018.</em> It
was true about Elixir, unfortunately, but I had an improvement for Rust 🦀. I
even <a href="https://pothix.com/post/contributing-to-rust/">had my first change merged into the
compiler</a>! The change itself was
quite simple, but it was great to understand how to contribute and hopefully,
new contributions will come this year!</p>
<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
<p>After 2017, I had a hangover of speaking. 😅</p>
<p>For those of you who remember, I spoke 24 times in 2017. I decided to create
some sort of a challenge for myself to speak more and was quite successful at
it. After such an achievement, I decided to change my priorities. 😃</p>
<p>To make things easier to track, I now have the <a href="/talks">talks page</a>, which I&rsquo;m
going to use it as a reference here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 2018, I spoke 7 times with 6 different presentations. 6 different
presentations delivered in pt-BR and one of them delivered in English.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In 2019, I spoke 2 times and both were the same presentation. I spoke at the
local Ruby meetup and brought that same (slightly changed) presentation to
Rubyconf Brasil.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We can clearly see that I&rsquo;m slowing down my pace of presentations. I came from
24 presentations in 2017, to 7 in 2018, to 2 in 2019. That&rsquo;s exactly what I
wanted to do. I have to say that I was already feeling bad to not be speaking
for some time and I was eager to speak in 2019. 😅 I don&rsquo;t think things are changing much for 2020 though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning that I was also on stage last year, but not
delivering a talk. I was one of the core organizers of <a href="https://2019.rustlatam.org">Rust LATAM</a>, the first
big conference about Rust in Latin America.  It was a great experience and you
can read more about it <a href="/post/how-was-rust-latam-2019/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h2>
<p>Every year Todoist releases an astonishing Year in review. Here is mine from
<a href="https://todoist.com/review/2017/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJ1QWNKZHhCQyIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxN30.zJQ9q-v1pyL1HwerqktZyNMLSwC7RxC0CKHUNdkoZQI">2017</a>,
<a href="https://todoist.com/review/2018/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJFaklzQ3BBeiIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOH0.2EMtZYiOkn8QjLUZjfgccy5ZUyfYtV5uGHfGgDSU1lQ">2018</a>,
and now
<a href="https://todoist.com/review/2019/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJmeU1mckJqdSIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOX0.HwRgJULd8lDN6FjCC5tcrMYVegrXQCk_X6D713bV14E">2019</a>,
which is the one we&rsquo;re going to explore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check my Todoist tasks! 🙂</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png" alt="A good design of some colorful balls rolling and the number of completed tasks in 2019" title="Tasks completed on my Todoist account"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed2.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed2.png" alt="16 tasks per day, 119 tasks per week, 516 tasks per month" title="Average of tasks completed on my Todoist account"></a></p>
<p>6198 tasks are less than what I expected since <strong>I completed 6323 tasks in 2018</strong>.
It&rsquo;s not a huge problem because it always depends on how you organize your task
manager. In my case, I also have my routine on my task manager so it can help
me to actually do the things I plan for myself. The plan for 2020 is to remove
my routine from Todoist and move it to my calendar, so I can only have the
important tasks there. By removing these tasks from Todoist, I will probably
have a report with fewer tasks next year and that&rsquo;s OK. 🙂</p>
<p>It looks like <strong>Friday is the day I complete more tasks</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png" alt="Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account. I complete an average of 24 completed tasks every Friday" title="Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account"></a></p>
<p>I think it happens because I usually post my snippets every Friday, so I
complete the list of tasks I have to post there every Friday.</p>
<p><strong>My most productive time is 10:00</strong> (not 16:00 as I had in 2017):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png" alt="A chart with peaks by the hour of the day. A drawing with a text show Sep 23 as the day I completed more tasks. Another drawing with a text saying that I postponed more tasks on Monday" title="Tasks completed by time and postponed by time"></a></p>
<p>I found it very interesting that the productivity chart correlates with my
<a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf">When
tracker</a>
(wrote about it on <a href="/post/my-current-productivity-workflow/">my current productivity workflow
2019</a>):</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png" title="My daily when tracker filled in 2018"><img src="/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png" alt="A sheet of paper with something that looks like a chart showing the times I feel more productive. It usually happens in the morning and late in the afternoon"></a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how those tasks are distributed throughout the year. You can clearly see my vacations on the light gray columns:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png" alt="Many small squares filled in scales of gray regarding the tasks I completed by day on my Todoist account" title="Tasks completed by day on my Todoist account"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still one of the 1% heavy users of Todoist! 😃</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-top-1.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-top-1.png" alt="Orange background with some spheres. The text says I have 11069 karma points and I&rsquo;m one of the top 1% users of Todoist" title="Top 1% user of Todoist"></a></p>
<p>The data and design of our year in review is awesome. I did not participate in
the project this year (as I did in 2017), but proud of what we can
deliver. 🎉</p>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-time.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-time.jpg" alt="Print screen of an Android phone showing a set of stats from the Podcast Addict app." title="Time listening to Podcasts this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-list.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-list.jpg" alt="Print screen of an Android phone showing a list of podcasts and the time listening to each. Nerdcast is the first with 5 days and 16 hours" title="Time listening by Podcasts"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have data about 2018 anymore, so I will just mention
2019 here.</p>
<p>If I was listening to the episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn&rsquo;t) it would
be equivalent to <strong>18 days and 4 hours</strong> of non-stop listening. As I usually
listen to Podcast in 2x or more (depending on many factors), I would say I
spent around 9 days listening to Podcasts, which is <strong>effectively around 216
hours of my time</strong>.</p>
<p>I usually listen to podcasts when I&rsquo;m commuting, walking the dog, washing the
dishes, doing exercises, etc. I&rsquo;m usually focusing on
<a href="https://pothix.com/post/audiobooks/">audiobooks</a>, but I listen to podcasts
between one book and another.</p>
<p>The list of podcasts shown here is actually my global list, not the yearly
one, unfortunately. I&rsquo;m not even listening to new episodes of some of these
anymore, but they are still there.</p>
<h2 id="hours-working-focusing-and-distractions">Hours working, focusing and distractions</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start checking all my data tracked using <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-comparison.png" alt="A bar chart for the year 2019 and 2018. Blue bars for 2019 and gray for 2018. They look similar in general but with changes in different months." title="Chart for time working in my full-time job"></a></p>
<p>The <strong>gray bars are related to the data for 2018</strong>. I believe the changes are
related to my scheduled vacations. :)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check my time working, considering my full-time job only:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-fulltime-job.png" alt="Bar chart for the year of 2019. The average seems to be around 150 hours. There&rsquo;s a list of categories at the bottom showing, deep work, meeting, and shallow work" title="Chart for time working in my full-time job"></a></p>
<p>April was conference + retreat + vacations for me, so it&rsquo;s an outlier.
Considering 40 days of vacations during the year (we don&rsquo;t have national
holidays, they are included in the 40 days) and dividing the average of 151
hours a month by 18 (21 working days - 3 days of vacations per month) <strong>I have an
average of 8 hours and a half of work every day</strong>. At <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>,
we recommend to not work more than 8 hours a day, so I&rsquo;m working a bit more but
it&rsquo;s under control.</p>
<p><strong>I spent 81 hours of my year in meetings</strong>. Most of them were weekly sync
meetings with my remote team and also a monthly 1-on-1 with the head of my
team. I consider all of those meetings productive. There was <strong>not a single
meeting last year where I found myself wasting my time</strong>, so these 81 hours are
actually fine.</p>
<p>The most interesting part for me is the Shallow x Deep work ratio. <strong>I have
almost 3 times less time Deep working than Shallow working</strong>, which is not that
good. This is totally something I have to improve in 2020.</p>
<p>To give a bit more context, <strong>I consider Deep work any work I can do without
distraction</strong>. Shallow work is the work I do while I have other tabs opened on
my browser or while I&rsquo;m doing something else on the side.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m not tracking that as I should. Sometimes I&rsquo;m focused on reading
Twist and answering questions, but as it&rsquo;s not coding, I consider it as shallow
work. I will certainly improve it for 2020. 🤞</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous review, I keep one freelance job, which is almost
a personal project for me. I like to improve the app and make it better. I don&rsquo;t
have freelance gigs, but this one I&rsquo;m happy to keep. Here is the time I tracked
about it this year (based on Toggl, not totally accurate):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-freelance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-freelance.png" alt="Bar chart. The average seems to be about 15 hours but there&rsquo;s a big outlier in Ju, with almost 70 hours." title="Chart for time working in my freelance job"></a></p>
<p>June is an outlier as I did the migration of the application to a different
infrastructure in one weekend. It was an exception as I don&rsquo;t work during
weekends most of the time. As it was my idea to do this migration, it was
personal to me. This migration project was the topic of my two presentations
this year, as I knew it would be an interesting topic to talk about.</p>
<p>Other than that, I usually don&rsquo;t work more than 20 hours a month for them. I
reserve some time every weekday to work on different things. This project is
usually the first in the list, but sometimes I just don&rsquo;t want to work on it
and decide to use my time for other things (tech-related or not).</p>
<p>What I wrote on my 2017 Year in review still holds:</p>
<pre><code>I really like my full-time job (more than ever!) but I like to do different
projects without constraints, it can be this freelance job or other activities
that also brings me joy.
</code></pre><p>I have a metric for the <strong>time I spent doing/planning my talks</strong> this year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-presentation.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-presentation.png" alt="Bar chart with only two charts, one in Jun and the other in Nov. Jun seems to be 4 times bigger." title="Chart for my time doing/planning presentations"></a></p>
<p>June was a busy month, just because I decided it would be. :) I want to keep
track of presentations, writing on my blog, etc. because I can easily metric
how much I&rsquo;m donating to the community. Sometimes, instead of working for my
freelance, I decided to write and publish something that may be useful to
someone else. Sometimes I decide to create slides for my next presentation at a
local meetup. If I take the ~10 hours, I can easily measure how much I&rsquo;m
donating to the community by applying my freelancing hour rate.  It may be
useless for other people, but it&rsquo;s highly valuable for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any money in exchange, but it&rsquo;s important for people to know that
others are donating their time because they like to do it and because they
believe it may be useful for someone else. I&rsquo;ve been participating/organizing
communities for more than 10 years now and I know how easy it is for people to
take local meetups for granted as it is free and someone else is taken care of
it.</p>
<p>Moving along with the metrics, let&rsquo;s check what data
<a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">rescuetime</a> can provide regarding my
productivity. :)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the productive and distracting hours for the entire year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2019.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2019.png" alt="An infographic with information for every month of 2019 in small bars and text about productivity. 2208 total hours logged, 1134 productive hours, and 525 distracting hours. My productivity pulse is 54" title="Rescuetime year in review metrics for 2019"></a></p>
<p>The metrics of 2018 were not posted last here but here are them for comparison:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2018.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2018.png" alt="An infographic with information for every month of 2018 in small bars and text about productivity. 2333 total hours logged, 1058 productive hours, and 769 distracting hours. My productivity pulse is 54" title="Rescuetime year in review metrics for 2018"></a></p>
<p>This is part of the <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/year-in-review/2019">year in
review</a> provided by rescuetime.
They also provide a chart with the categories I used the most:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png" alt="A strange-looking chart in a circular format. The lines above go towards the border showing which category I used the most. Communication & scheduling is the most used." title="Most used categories according to rescuetime"></a></p>
<p>The dashboard shows similar information but with some other things:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png" alt="The rescuetime dashboard showing metrics for the entire year.

<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-goals.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-goals.png" alt="A chart showing my goal for this year. It was 900 hours and 30 mins in total and 783 all productive time" title="Rescuetime goal chart for the year"></a></p>
<p><strong>I had a lot more productive hours than I had in 2017 or 2018</strong> and this is a
good thing. 🙂</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Again, <a href="https://last.fm">last.fm</a> did a great year in review for me, so let&rsquo;s
check some stats here.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png" alt="A chart of songs scrobbled by month. In total was 5501 scrobles." title="Songs scrobbled this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png" alt="6 different charts with the data. Listening time, top tags, listening week, artists, albums, and tracks" title="Listening stats for this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png" alt="Listening percentiles compared to the user base" title="Listening percentiles compared to the user base"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-discovery.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-discovery.png" alt="Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year" title="Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://music.google.com">Google Music</a> for two years now, so I was
already expecting to not have 500%+ on my Discovery as I had in 2017. My
Discovery this time is mostly related to Pops Staples, which is awesome BTW.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m listening to a <strong>lot of Heavy and Thrash metal, along with a lot
of Soundtracks, which is mostly Howard Shore</strong> (no news here).</p>
<p>In 2017, I listened to more music between 20:00 nad 21:00 and how it changed
between 10:00 and 11:00. I believe it&rsquo;s because I changed, even more, my routine
to be even more a morning person. I usually use music to focus or to create the
mood for the day, so it would make sense.</p>
<p>I have no idea why Thursday is the big outlier this year. Maybe because I&rsquo;m
afraid about the end of the week and I&rsquo;m using music to concentrate to deliver
everything I postponed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday? LOL</p>
<p><a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix">Exist.io</a> also provided data about the
songs I listened to (via Last.fm):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-exist.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-exist.png" alt="My the top songs played was Low Down by Black Label Society, Humanity by Scorpions, Unreal by Soil, Nothing Else Matters by Metallica and Black 7 by Soil" title="Songs scrobbled this year"></a></p>
<p>This is the piece of information I was missing from Last.fm, so it&rsquo;s nice to
see it here 😃.</p>
<h2 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h2>
<p>I had a topic for TV shows in 2017 and I&rsquo;m just realizing how this is not a
priority for me anymore. I&rsquo;m not tracking the TV shows and I watch and I&rsquo;m not
even watching that much anymore.</p>
<p>There are some TV shows that I watched and enjoyed though: <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>
(it&rsquo;s not about the end, but the journey) and <strong>Vikings</strong>. <strong>Westworld Season
2</strong> was OK. There&rsquo;s also <strong>Altered Carbon</strong> I watched in 2018 that I enjoyed,
the concept is great.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t even remember the ones I watched. I tried to use
<a href="https://trakt.tv">Trakt.tv</a> but they don&rsquo;t provide your data if you&rsquo;re not
paying, so&hellip; whatever. I checked <a href="https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/10615776/profile">TV
time</a> and it seems they are
adding movies to the app, so maybe I will start using it again since the app
is great.</p>
<h2 id="physical-data">Physical data</h2>
<p>In 2017 I had a hard time to come up with the metrics for my Physical
activities and it seems things did not improve in the past two years. Someone
may say I should buy the expensive band X or the super expensive hardware Y,
but please don&rsquo;t. I prefer a simple and inexpensive device that tracks and
sends the data to other places.</p>
<p>Getting back to what I have. Now I can&rsquo;t get that many bars on screen no Miband and
they only provide a monthly summary, not an early one. Google fit is not very
helpful as well:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/steps1.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/steps1.jpg" alt="Screenshot from the Miband app showing a bar chart" title="Number of steps according to Miband"></a>

<p>My savior this time will be <a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix">Exist.io</a>,
because they have monthly averages:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-exist.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-exist.jpg" alt="A bar chart since June 2018. It shows the average steps by month. The average seems to be around 8000 steps a month" title="Average steps by month according to Exist"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an average, not the full number of steps, but it&rsquo;s good enough. I
don&rsquo;t need the total number of steps by year, as my goal is just to understand
if I&rsquo;m walking enough, and I don&rsquo;t need a precise number for that.</p>
<p>Google location timeline gave me some yearly numbers about walking and public transportation:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity.png" alt="A car and two circles showing my activity for 2019. 857 km walking, or 250 hours. 5222 km in transportation, or 200 hours" title="Activity according to Google Maps"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity2.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity2.png" alt="A globe with the text: &ldquo;1.3 times around the world&rdquo;. I traveled a total distance of 53,479km" title="Total distance according to Google maps"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see I walked more than 800km this year. <strong>April was the month I
had more steps</strong> and it was probably because of my vacations in Portugal 🇵🇹.</p>
<h3 id="weight">Weight</h3>
<p>I tracked my weight this year as well, here is the data I have:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg" alt="A chart showing how my weight changed across the year. It had a good downwards curve at the end." title="My weight according to Google Fit"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-miband.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-miband.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Miband app showing some stats, including my current weight (76.60kg) and BMI (23.6)" title="My current weight and BMI according to Mifit"></a></p>
<p>Some data is missing from January to May, but after that, I took the Gym
and diet seriously, so we can clearly see how things start to improve.</p>
<p>When I got back from vacation (October), I was ready for some improvement
again and I lose more weight. The weight doesn&rsquo;t mean much as there are many other
important things to track. In my case, I know it was not just weight, I have
better muscles than last year and feel much better as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that many metrics from the Gym. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t like Gyms
that much, so I try to do only do the really necessary things. I do
measurements from time to time because it&rsquo;s provided by the Gym. I do
everything on paper there, so I don&rsquo;t spend any time with that.</p>
<p>I take pictures of the data and keep it with me. This time I decided to just
quickly put that on a spreadsheet and generate some charts. Here is what I
have since 2018:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/gym-logs.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/gym-logs.png" alt="Many charts showing the difference in measurement. They don&rsquo;t show much, there are too few data points." title="My manual measurement tracking. Too few data points, unfortunately"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s not much data and data is missing sometimes for some
reason. <strong>All measurements are done in centimeters</strong> (of course). For the three
initial charts, the less the better. The opposite is true for the charts below
it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to correlate between the Gym measurements and the weight
though.</p>
<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>
<p>Again, the Miband app is not very useful:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep1.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep1.jpg" alt="Bar chart showing data from November to January. Some more stats about the current month" title="Sleep information according to Mifit"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep2.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep2.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Mifit app showing the sleep data for the current month. Time of sleep woke up time and avg deep sleep" title="Sleep data for the current month according to Mifit"></a></p>
<p>I sync the same data with Google fit and connect it to
<a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix">Exist.io</a>. Those two services provide
some good visualizations of my data:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg" alt="Bar chart by month on the Google Fit app. It shows December as the month with more Sleep. The average seems to be 7 hours and 30 min" title="Amount of sleep according to Google fit"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-exist.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-exist.jpg" alt="Bar chart by month on the Exist app" title="Sleep data according to Exist"></a></p>
<p>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435182291">Why We
Sleep</a> in July and I was
curious to see how changing my routine influenced my sleep. I was expecting to
have a more immediate impact on August or September, but I can see <strong>I only had
a real impact after September</strong>. :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&amp;hl=en">Sleep as
Android</a>
app to get some sleep data. I connect it to my Miband and let it track. Here is
the data I was able to extract from the app:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing the general stats. Duration of 7 hours, Irregularity of ~1 hour, 36% of deep sleep, 93% of efficiency" title="General stats according to Sleep as Android"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my chronotype of Morning lark" title="My chronotype according to Sleep as Android"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a morning lark. I usually work better in the morning and go to sleep
earlier. The average duration of my sleep is a bit low in this app for some
reason, but it&rsquo;s usually between 7h and 7h30m.</p>
<p>The Efficiency is the time I&rsquo;m in bed but actually sleeping not browsing the
internet or having problems to sleep. 93% is a good value.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my deep sleep time. It seems to have a downward tendency." title="My deep work time according to Sleep as Android"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my sleep irregularity. The chart data seems irregular too." title="My irregularity of sleep according to Sleep as Android"></a></p>
<p>My deep sleep is decreasing in the past months for some reason, I have to
improve this situation. I believe the decrease of deep work is happening
because of my habit of looking at my cellphone before sleeping. I will try to
cut the cellphone at night again.</p>
<p>My irregularity of sleep is also not good, I should have close to no
irregularity of sleep. I hope to improve that until the middle of the year,
after that I can&rsquo;t promise anything. 😉</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing the wake-up time for working days and free days" title="Wake up time for working days and free days according to Sleep as Android"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my fall asleep hour. The duration is worse when I sleep later." title="Duration of sleep by fall asleep hours according to Sleep as Android"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that I usually wake up later and sometimes sleep more
when it&rsquo;s &ldquo;free days&rdquo; (holidays and weekend), but most of the time I keep the
same duration. The time I go to sleep is also clearly related to the duration
of the second chart. I believe this is pretty common since I have time to
wake up but not a time to go to sleep. I&rsquo;m aware of the problem already and I
hope to improve it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the sleep data I have and I have to say I&rsquo;m curious about the
data I will have about that next year.</p>
<h2 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h2>
<p>This year I didn&rsquo;t have the data to consolidate and I don&rsquo;t want to check every
weekly email to consolidate it. Grammarly will have to do better if they want
their customers to get better data about their writings. Sorry Grammarly,
weekly emails are not enough.</p>
<p>This is the data I have from the last email I received before my vacations in
December:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly.png" alt="Screenshot of the email sent by Grammarly. It shows the number of words checked (13618)" title="Grammarly data for this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly2.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly2.png" alt="Screenshot of the email sent by Grammarly. It shows the number of alerts shown (156),  the number of unique words used (2844), and total words checked (1,478,380)" title="Grammarly data for this year"></a></p>
<p>We can see that I wrote almost 1.5MM words since I started. I checked the first
time Grammarly sent this number and it was 963,838 words written on Feb 11th.
Let&rsquo;s do a simple math:</p>
<pre><code>1478380 - 963838 = 514542   -- words written between Feb and Dec
514542 / 10 = 51424 -- words by month (Feb -&gt; Dec)
</code></pre><p>It seems <strong>I write around 50k words every month</strong>. It would be <strong>around 600k works
a year</strong>. 🙂</p>
<p>I would love to have a chart like <a href="/post/2017-year-in-review/">the one I had in
2017</a> so I could see what errors I had and so on
but it&rsquo;s not viable, unfortunately. 😕</p>
<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>
<p>In 2018, I went to <strong>Chile</strong> and the <strong>USA</strong>. In 2019, I went to <strong>Uruguay</strong>,
the <strong>USA</strong>, and <strong>Portugal</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is the summary of the year and all-time data by Google:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general.png" alt="World map view with pins to the countries I visited" title="General view of my locations data"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general2.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general2.png" alt="My all-time data. 9 countries visited, 114 cities, and 1048 places." title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>I have to say that I&rsquo;m very proud of myself when I see all-time data. I
believe that getting to know other places and cultures is something that
expands your mind in many ways. 🙂</p>
<p>Here are some of the cities and places I visited this year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places.png" alt="Pictures of cities I visited. Montevideo, Boulder, and Ponta Delgada" title="Cities visited, by Google locations"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places2.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places2.png" alt="Pictures of places I visited. Palace of Monserrate, Campos do Jordão, Cascais, Parque Terra Nostra, Plaza Zabala" title="Places visited, by Google locations"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with my trips in 2019.</p>
<h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2>
<p>I have some sad news about my expenses data this year. The app I was using
before is now even worse, so I decided to not use it anymore and remove all my
data from there.</p>
<p>The good news is that I decided to invest more time on investing this year, so
I had to organize my finances somehow. Because of the need for an organization, I
had to get all my investing data into one spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I decided to use
<a href="https://www.dlombelloplanilhas.com/planilhas/controle-de-investimentos">dlombello&rsquo;s</a>
spreadsheet for that (pt-BR only). I have to say that I&rsquo;m amazed by how
feature-complete is this spreadsheet. It&rsquo;s still worrisome that you have to
give full access to your Google account for it to work (because of external
scripts), so I created a Google account just for that. Until now, it totally
worth the effort.</p>
<p>Here are some charts I can get from the spreadsheet:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/invest-by-type.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/invest-by-type.png" alt="Pizza chart for my types of investments" title="Types of investments by dlombello spreadsheet"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/invest-by-index.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/invest-by-index.png" alt="Pizza chart for my types of investments by index" title="Types of investments by index via dlombello spreadsheet"></a></p>
<p>The first chart shows the types of investments I have. The Orange and green are
related to the stock market and the rest is bonds and others. The second chart
is the indexes these investments are related to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think these charts are very good, but I started to use this spreadsheet
last month and I don&rsquo;t have that many ways to retrieve good information from it
yet. I hope to have better data next year, let&rsquo;s see how it goes. 😉</p>
<p>Regarding my savings, it <strong>increased by 23.87%</strong> this year (compared to 26.72%
in 2018 and 16.83% for a bit more than half of 2017), an <strong>average increase of 2.57%</strong> per month.</p>
<p>In 2017, I said I had 75.10% of my savings goal. Well, I met this goal in 2018. 😅</p>
<p>The plan was done long ago and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense anymore given the current
economic conditions. I decided to keep it anyway as it would be good to keep
the history until I meet the goal. When I finally got to the value I wanted, I
started a new plan.</p>
<p>Considering this new plan and the whole year of 2019, <strong>I have 89.40% of my
goal</strong>. I know it&rsquo;s weird to just introduce this value without further
background, but just wanted to keep it here for my future self.</p>
<p>Given the current circumstances and my life choices, this goal will have to
change this year. I&rsquo;m OK with these changes, it&rsquo;s important to have plans but
it&rsquo;s also important to change them if the circumstances require such change
IMO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what this new year will do to my expenses and
general portfolio 😅.</p>
<h2 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h2>
<p>Phew&hellip; finally finished this one. 😅</p>
<p>This time I could track the whole process and <strong>it took 17h21min to write this
blog post</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-writing-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-writing-time.png" alt="The total time and a list of entries with their duration" title="Total time to write this blog post"></a></p>
<p>I can say the same thing I said in 2017: It totally worth my time
to write this. We have so many good insights when reviewing the data we
collected. 😌</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have nothing to complain about 2018 and 2019. The only thing I should have
done earlier in the year in review for 2018 because it totally changes my mood
about what I did. It&rsquo;s great to do reviews because you can clearly see (at
least it&rsquo;s the case for me) that you did what you wanted to do in the general
context.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me that doing my year in review in 2017 helped to improve things
I could only see when looking in &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s eye view&rdquo;. Some things are not so
noticeable when you&rsquo;re seeing them in context, but they become clear when you
put them in a yearly context.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure 2020 will be a year full of huge challenges for me, but I&rsquo;m also
curious to see the data I&rsquo;m going to collect this year! 😉</p>

contribution</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-dream">The dream</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I always wanted to contribute to core things. I
still want to have a commit on the Linux kernel someday, and it&rsquo;s not the first
time I try to contribute to a programming language.</p>
<p>I read the kernel source code multiple times and also read their contribution
guides, but it&rsquo;s not simple to contribute. It&rsquo;s hard to find issues you can
understand, reproduce, and compile. It may not be true for people out there,
but it was my personal experience.</p>
<p>I also tried to contribute to the Ruby programming language. I was working with
Ruby for many years, so I decided to read its source. I didn&rsquo;t find the code
easy to follow, and the issues are not easy to find and reproduce. For Ruby,
it&rsquo;s even worse, since some things are still in Japanese, especially the
discussions. The language community is not very accessible to contributions
like the rest of the community.</p>
<p>These paragraphs are not to say bad things about these communities. I still
love Linux and the Ruby programming language. I just want to show my previous
attempts and what went wrong. 😉</p>
<h3 id="the-rust-scenario">The Rust scenario</h3>
<p>Different from the Linux kernel and the Ruby programming language, the Rust
programming language is implemented in Rust itself (instead of C), which makes
things even better. 🙂</p>
<p>The community and contribution guides are both <strong>awesome</strong>. You can feel the
enormous amount of work the community puts on documenting stuff so people can
find it easy to fix small things or even suggest and implement significant
features.</p>
<p>The whole process of how the community organizes itself is very open and
encourages everyone to take part in it. This is not something I found on my
previous attempts of contributions.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-started">How it started</h3>
<p>At <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>, we (speaking about my team here) try to
encourage people to learn new things every week. You should reserve some time
to try new things and bring some knowledge back to the team. If you don&rsquo;t book
work time for that, you will probably overwork or never have time to improve
your development skills.</p>
<p>Every week we&rsquo;re naming someone to be responsible for describing what he/she
learned during our next weekly meeting. It doesn&rsquo;t mean this is the only person
that has to learn something, but at least one will be responsible for
describing to the rest of the team.</p>
<p>During the past week, I volunteered to take some time to learn something and
report back. What I have in my schedule for months now (I would say more than
one year) is to contribute anything to the Rust compiler. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
what the contribution will be, but it has to be something meaningful and change
the compiler in some way.</p>
<p>With some work hours reserved (around 3 hours of work during the week) and some
of my free time, I was ready to start!</p>
<h2 id="my-step-by-step-to-the-first-contribution">My step by step to the first contribution</h2>
<p><em>PS. I will link to a lot of documentation here, it&rsquo;s possible that they will
change the links and it will break, but hope the whole context helps if the
links are not 100% functional after some time</em></p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-structure">Understanding the structure</h3>
<p>The first step was to read the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>
file. There&rsquo;s <strong>a lot</strong> of good stuff there. Seriously, it seems obvious, but
it&rsquo;s not like other projects I tried and gave up quickly, it shows/points to
everything you need to know.</p>
<p>If we refer to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-build-system">the build system
section</a>,
we will be quickly introduced to the build script (<code>x.py</code>) and to <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/building/how-to-build-and-run.html">a complete
guide about how the compiler
works</a>!
:)</p>
<p>From there, you will understand how the compiler works and how you can use the
python script to build a small piece of it, which is what you want to be able
to fix a bug.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-issue">Finding the issue</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested about the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=diagnostic">diagnostic
issues</a>,
so I reached out to the guy who is more familiar to this part of the codebase
(<a href="http://github.com/estebank">@estebank</a>) via
<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com">Zulip</a>, which is currently the tool of choice
for communication with the compiler team.</p>
<p>I met Esteban at <a href="https://rustconf.com">Rustconf</a> and <a href="https://rustlatam.org">Rust
LATAM</a>, so it was easy to introduce myself (again).
Everyone I talked to until now was very receptive to help when you&rsquo;re polite
(of course) and asking for help, even if they don&rsquo;t know you, so don&rsquo;t be
afraid to reach out to people.</p>
<p>Esteban described which labels would be suitable for my first issue (in this
case, <code>d-papercut</code>), and I started to read one by one to pick mine.</p>
<p>After some time, I decided to investigate <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61286">an issue about the suggestion for
the #[repr = &ldquo;C&rdquo;] syntax</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-compilation">The first compilation</h3>
<p>The issue I chose mention <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/609ffa1a890fd6b8b0364cd7b35bf1d45abf82d0/src/test/ui/repr.stderr">a <code>.stderr</code> file on the
codebase</a>,
which is a great way to start. :D</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to look for one of the strings I found there (the
text &ldquo;<code>must be of the form</code>&quot;) and change it to something else.</p>
<p>I changed it to <code>must be of the whatever</code> and referred back to the
documentation on how to build the compiler.</p>
<p><em>As a side note: The way the compiler is compiled is very interesting. It has
three different stages. It downloads the beta compiler to compile itself (Rust
is written in Rust, remember?), and then it uses the generated compiler to
build the compiler again against itself. :) (there&rsquo;s much more, but I recommend
reading the official documentation if you&rsquo;re interested ;) ).</em></p>
<p>After trying some commands to build the repository and get used to the time it
takes to compile (and how to make the compilation faster by compiling parts of
it), I got my first version of the compiler and was able to compile a sample
program.</p>
<p>I have to say that it&rsquo;s very satisfying to see the change you did there. It
doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s just a string. It proves to me that the first step is
done, and it&rsquo;s realistic to continue. o/</p>
<p>Now that I can build the compiler, I can get back to the issue and modify the
mentioned test.</p>
<h3 id="testing-the-compiler">Testing the compiler</h3>
<p>We will now use <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/tests/intro.html">the rustc
documentation</a> again
to understand how to run the test suite for the compiler.</p>
<p>The documentation helps to understand how the testing organization and
infrastructure works. It also shows the various types of tests you will find
and how to run them. In my case, I had to run the UI tests of the compiler, so
I could run it using the <code>x.py</code> script just like I do with everything else:</p>
<pre><code>./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui
</code></pre><p><em>PS. I will not go into the details of the code I used since you can refer to
the documentation I linked and get a much better and detailed explanation.</em></p>
<p>While trying to understand how the testing infrastructure works, I found a
problem with the documentation, so <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61286">I submitted a PR to the compiler
doucumentation</a> and it was
accepted. 🎉</p>
<p>Now, getting back to the issue. When I ran the test command, it shows me that I
now have a broken test, since I changed the word <code>form</code> to the word <code>whatever</code>.
\o/</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s first fix the test to have the behavior I wanted. In this case, I
want to recommend <code>#[repr(C)]</code> to everything instead of a statement that is not
valid. By doing that, the editors can suggest valid code instead of just a
tooltip with and list and <code>...</code>.</p>
<p>Now that I have a broken test, I can <code>checkout</code> the code file and start looking
for the file to change.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-code-and-changing-whats-needed">Understanding the code and changing what&rsquo;s needed</h3>
<p>This is the part where we should be more used to. When I say <em>more used to</em>, I
mean it&rsquo;s more related to our day-to-day job, whatever it is. It&rsquo;s just another
codebase with a bug that you have to find out. 😉</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start debugging it function by function and understanding which code is
being called. We will do that until we find the piece of code that has to be
changed.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re going up the stack, you will probably find many other things you
have no idea how/why they are there. In some cases, you may see features of the
language that you&rsquo;re still not familiar with, so you may also take some time to
learn those to continue your journey. That was the case for me with macros. 🙂</p>
<p>After some time, I finally found the place I had to change, and it was simple
for this particular case I was trying to solve.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-pull-request">Creating the pull request</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests">To create a Pull Request, we can refer to this section in the Rust
documentation</a>.
I used that to create mine and mention Esteban.</p>
<p>There are some bots to help the community to take care of managing the PRs, so
we (as a community) have many powers to ask for reviews, approve PRs, create a
queue of PRs to merge, etc.</p>
<p>To mention someone to review, I used the <code>r? @username</code> function of the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-highfive">rust-highfive</a> bot, so it can assign the
person who is knowledgeable on that part of the codebase (@estebank in my
case).</p>
<p>After creating the PR, the Rust language infrastructure will run the tests (it
was Travis before, Azure pipelines currently, and may change to Github actions
in the future) and report back in the PR.</p>
<p>After some time (~2 hours), I got the report that I broke the build with my
changes (🤦) because there were other tests in a different part of the code,
expecting that message as a diagnostic for the <code>[repr = &quot;C&quot;]</code> syntax. I checked
the code again and just fixed the test.</p>
<h3 id="pr-and-discussions">PR and discussions</h3>
<p>As usual, there was some discussion about the change. The PR usually stays
there for some days until one of the maintainers have enough time to take a
look at it and decide if it&rsquo;s worth changing.</p>
<p>The discussions usually happen on the PR itself, but in my case, there were
some discussions with Esteban via Zulip, as the change was straightforward, and
I had some questions.</p>
<p>It turns out that my change only partially fixes the issue because it will need
something better designed for this case. The idea is to suggest the right
<code>repr</code> for the context of the code. This change will take much more knowledge
(and time 😅) than I have now.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Rust team found the change to be valuable enough to merge in,
even if it doesn&rsquo;t fix the issue altogether, so <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66206">the PR was approved
</a>!</p>
<h3 id="after-the-approval">After the approval</h3>
<p>When your PR is approved, the <strong><a href="https://github.com/bors">@bors</a></strong> bot will add
it to the <a href="https://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust">the queue of PRs to
merge</a> and will eventually be
merged to the master branch.</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/contributing-to-rust.jpg"><img src="/images/posts/contributing-to-rust.jpg" alt="Image of the Rust repository on GitHub with the merge of my commit as the latest commit"></a></p>
<p>You will also be added to the <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/all-time/">Thanks
page</a> as you&rsquo;re now part of the
Rust repository with you commit 🎉.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>I like to do it in baby steps. I planned to try something simple, so I could
understand the basics of contributing to the compiler. It&rsquo;s now done. 🙂</p>
<p>Now that I (and hopefully, you as well) understand the processes to contribute
and have the setup to do it, I can go to the next step and try more issues. The
plan is to focus on the diagnostics part of the compiler (which is the part I
like the most) and solve small issues that may have a high impact on how the
developers are interacting with the language.</p>
<p>When I feel comfortable with the small issues, I can look for something
bigger&hellip; but&hellip; baby steps. 😉</p>

            <description>From time to time, I receive questions about my productivity workflow, so I decided to write it down here. Keep in mind it&amp;rsquo;s a living thing and may change with time, but what I&amp;rsquo;m documenting here is what I&amp;rsquo;m using right now.
Tool As you probably know, I work for Doist for some time now, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Todoist user since 2007, so the my tool of choice is quite obvious.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From time to time, I receive questions about my productivity workflow, so I
decided to write it down here. Keep in mind it&rsquo;s a living thing and may change
with time, but what I&rsquo;m documenting here is what I&rsquo;m using right now.</p>
<h2 id="tool">Tool</h2>
<p>As you probably know, <a href="/post/doist-pothix">I work for Doist</a> for some time now,
and I&rsquo;m a Todoist user since 2007, so the my tool of choice is quite obvious.</p>
<p>I love how <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> brings simplicity to creating and
managing tasks. Things become even better when you add filters to the mix. 😉</p>
<p>The organization for my top level projects looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal</strong>: Anything personal like money, investments, random thoughts, etc.</li>
<li><strong>MyCompany</strong>: Bureaucracy of having a BR company, things to pay, people to reach, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: Everything related to my full time job. It&rsquo;s probably the one with more sub-projects and tasks</li>
<li><strong>Hobbies</strong>: I have many, so I have a project for each. Examples: Drums, MTG, Cardistry, Photography, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Me &amp; Wife</strong>: A shared project with my wife. Anything we do together we add there.</li>
<li><strong>Others</strong>: projects I could not fit in any other category. Example: todoist integrations</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these top level projects have have their own sub-projects.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>I use due dates to guide my life inside todoist. Every day I open Todoist and
find what I have to do during that day.</p>
<p>When I have something in mind it goes to my <code>Inbox</code> project. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
if I&rsquo;m at the computer or walking on the street, I just open todoist and add it
there so I can do the triage later.</p>
<p>I try to apply the <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> idea,
but my own version of GTD looks like <a href="https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/">Zen To
Done</a>
to be honest. The principles are the same in the end, but the methods differ.</p>
<p>Both methods say you have to process your <code>Inbox</code> at least once a day, and
that&rsquo;s exactly what I do. Every task I add to my <code>Inbox</code> in project on Todoist
will be processed and added to the right project with a possible due date so it
will pop up in my Today list in the future.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter much if I will finish all of the tasks or not, but they are
there to remember me what I planned for that day and what is important to keep
focused on. If I can&rsquo;t finish at the end of the day I postpone for the next or
find a due in the future where this task will it makes more sense to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Everything</strong> I have to do is added to Todoist. I don&rsquo;t keep anything in my
mind because I don&rsquo;t want anything asking for attention when I have to focus.
If there&rsquo;s something to do on Monday, I can rest assured that Todoist will
notify me about that in the right day and time.</p>
<h2 id="routine">Routine</h2>
<p>I love routines, but it&rsquo;s important that I&rsquo;m able to have full control over
them, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I have. I built my current routine based on my
schedule, my wife&rsquo;s schedule, the times I feel more productive, and other
studies I did to myself through the years.</p>
<p>Every weekday I have at least 8 tasks that are fixed and define my routine:</p>
<ul>
<li>[06:00] Wake up and prepare breakfast
<ul>
<li>I have some notes on this one. Sometimes I want to prepare a different
breakfast and never remember how to do it, so it&rsquo;s there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[08:00] Walk the dog</li>
<li>[10:30] Start the deep work session</li>
<li>[12:30] Go to the Gym</li>
<li>[14:00] Record body data
<ul>
<li>I try to quantify myself as much as possible. This is just a reminder to add my weight to the tracking app</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[17:00] Start the deep work session</li>
<li>[19:00] Relax after a good day of work</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the things <strong>I want to do</strong>. Sometimes people say things like: &ldquo;You
let your task app say what you have to do&rdquo;, but is quite the opposite. I plan
what I want for my days and I use my task list to keep me focused on what I
want.</p>
<p>Some of these tasks trigger integrations that help me get laser focused on what
I want to do. A good example is the <code>Start the deep work session</code>, as it
triggers the &ldquo;Focus time&rdquo; of <a href="https://rescuetime.com">rescuetime</a> and block
sites I consider not productive.</p>
<h2 id="reccuring-tasks">Reccuring tasks</h2>
<p>I have some recurring tasks that are not part of my routine and they are not
related to work. It&rsquo;s also important to make time for the things you care
about, not just work-related tasks.</p>
<p>Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check a Slack group of friends I want to keep in touch</li>
<li>Check the Discord of the conference/community I&rsquo;m currently a core organizer</li>
<li>Remember to track my progress on Goodreads and write reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Track my reading progress help me to stay on track. Writing reviews help me to
retain more information by reviewing it to myself.</p>
<h2 id="filtering-to-avoid-distractions">Filtering to avoid distractions</h2>
<p>I use Todoist filters a lot!</p>
<p>Filters are very useful to&hellip; hm&hellip; filter non-important tasks from your current
focus mode i.e. if you&rsquo;re doing deep work, you don&rsquo;t need to know your routine.</p>
<p>I like to consume books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15679564.Willian_Molinari">my average is 30 books a
year</a>, and
every time I consume a book that mentions productivity I try the method with
filters.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break down my filters and explain their usage 🙂</p>
<h3 id="peak-trough-recovery">Peak, trough, recovery</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peak &ndash; <em><code>@peak &amp; today &amp; (assigned to: me | !assigned)</code></em></li>
<li>Trough &ndash; <em><code>(@trough | (!@peak &amp; !@recovery)) &amp;  today &amp; (assigned to: me | !assigned)</code></em></li>
<li>Recovery &ndash; <em><code>(@recovery | @peak) &amp; today &amp; (assigned to: me | !assigned)</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I also rely on Todoist labels to mark the tasks I want to have
in each of these chunks.</p>
<p>These filters came from the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2254843906">When</a>.
I used the <a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf">Daily when tracker</a> to check when was my peak, trough, and recovery times:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png" alt="A sheet of paper with something that looks like a chart showing the times I feel more productive"></p>
<p>I also use the concept of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243">Deep work</a> described by the book with the same name.</p>
<p>This is the reason why I have the task &ldquo;<em>Start the deep work session</em>&rdquo; in the
morning and at the end of the afternooon.</p>
<h3 id="deep-work-filters">Deep work filters</h3>
<p>Based on the same <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243">Deep work</a>
book mentioned above, I also use <code>@deepwork</code> labels on Todoist so I can filter
the right tasks depending on my current mode.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the concept, it basically tells you to reserve chunks of your
day to work on things without distractions. It means: no cellphones, no social
media, no chatting, no email, etc.</p>
<p>I usually have the following filters as favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep @ Work &ndash; <em><code>(today | overdue)  &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; @deep_work &amp; ##Work</code></em></li>
<li>Shallow @ Work &ndash; <em><code>(today | overdue)  &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; !@deep_work &amp; ##Work</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;<code>Deep @ Work</code>&rdquo; filter gets all tasks from projects under my &ldquo;<code>Work</code>&rdquo;
project that should be done <code>today</code> and have the &ldquo;<code>@deepwork</code>&rdquo; tag.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<code>Shallow @ Work</code>&rdquo; filter is almost the same but it takes everything
<strong>without</strong> the &ldquo;<code>@deepwork</code>&rdquo; label. Everything else without this label is
considered shallow work.</p>
<h3 id="priority-filters">Priority filters</h3>
<p>I also have some filters based on the tasks I set priorities, so I can quickly
see what should be a priority for my day instead of just reacting to what is
going on. It doens&rsquo;t work all the time because <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1120/1*tDk8uelQtJnpx33rIQVjjA.png">urgent and
important</a>
things sometimes pop up, but it gives me a clear view of what my priorities
are.</p>
<p>Here are the filters I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority today &ndash; <em>``(today | overdue) &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; p1</em></li>
<li>Priority @ Work &ndash; <em><code>(today | overdue) &amp; (assigned to: me|!assigned) &amp; (p1 | p2 | p3) &amp; ##Work</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>These two helps me when I just want to focus on the work I have to do today.
Sometimes I have personal things that are also priority, so I keep both
together, but I mostly use the <code>Priority @ Work</code>.</p>
<h2 id="integrations-and-automation">Integrations and automation</h2>
<p>I mentioned the trigger I have for rescuetime&rsquo;s Focus mode but it&rsquo;s not the only automation I have. Here are some others:</p>
<h3 id="shopping-list">Shopping list</h3>
<p>I keep a shopping list in Todoist shared with my wife. Every time we see that
something is missing and have to be bought, we try to add it there right away.</p>
<p>I have the location reminder enabled for Todoist in on my phone, so it reminds
me to check that list every time I&rsquo;m nearby a local supermarket, which happens
almost every day because of my daily routine.</p>
<p>Every time I check a task, IFTTT sends a message to a group chat in Telegram,
informing my wife that it&rsquo;s done so she will not buy it again. Sometimes we
forget to check the list, so it&rsquo;s helpful to get a reminder that it was bought
already.</p>
<h3 id="weekly-snippets">Weekly snippets</h3>
<p>Every week at Doist, we post a list of important tasks we did during the past
week and what we plan to do during the next.</p>
<p>I add a &ldquo;<code>@snippet</code>&rdquo; label to every task I want to report. When a task with a
&ldquo;<code>@snippet</code>&rdquo; label is completed, IFTTT creates a new task in a project called
&ldquo;<code>Snippets</code>&rdquo; with the completion date and the task project in the task title.</p>
<p>When I want to report that, I go the the &ldquo;<code>Snippets</code>&rdquo; project, click on the menu,
<strong>Export as a Template</strong>, and <strong>Export as file</strong>. I have a note in the same
project with a command the does the job of formatting that:</p>
<pre><code>cat ~/Downloads/Snippets.csv | grep -v project_note | grep &quot;task,&quot; | awk -F &quot;,&quot; '/1/ {print &quot;- &quot; $2}'; rm /home/pothix/Downloads/Snippets.csv
</code></pre><p>So I can just post it to <a href="https://twist.com">Twist</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-tipical-day-looks-like">How a tipical day looks like</h2>
<p>I wake up early (because that&rsquo;s what I want for myself, I don&rsquo;t have to),
prepare the breakfast, and take some time to eat and chat with my wife. We try
to not waste our time together looking at cellphones.</p>
<p>After breakfast I check my Todoist and what has to be done for the day, just to
be sure there&rsquo;s nothing pressing for the next 1-2 hours. If it&rsquo;s OK, I take
these 1-2 hours for myself. I&rsquo;m now writing this blog post. ;)</p>
<p>After that, the <a href="#routine">routine I described</a> starts. There are many other
tasks that are not part of my routine, so I use filters to focus on what I
think fits better for that time.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I postpone my tasks (if any) or just let them become
overdue to be postponed quickly via Todoist on the next day. I usually don&rsquo;t
have anything pressing from 6-8 a.m. so I don&rsquo;t have to check my plans for
tomorrow every night.</p>
<h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2007, when I started looking for a productivity tool
and found Todoist. It&rsquo;s a lot of practice to have a working system/process.</p>
<p>I used different tools along the way (Remember the milk, Toodledo, Habitica,
Thingking Rock, Google keep, and the list goes on) but I always came back to
Todoist because I really like it. It&rsquo;s not by coincidence that I&rsquo;m working for
Doist, I think about that since the beginning, but decided to apply for it in
2017.</p>
<p><strong>I love Todoist and I recommend it, but keep in mind that it&rsquo;s not about the
tool, but your mindset, and how you organize your process.</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>persistence is important</strong>. Your process will certainly
fail (as the one I described do), but you will improve it and make it (and
yourself!) better in the process. If it&rsquo;s not working, just think about it and
adjust it to match your way of doing things.</p>
<p>Stay focused and productive 😉</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a proud core organizer of the <a href="https://rustlatam.org">Rust
LATAM conference</a>. 🎉 The conference happened
on March 29 and 30, and this post describes how it was to organize the
whole thing.</p>
<p>Even with the small problems we had (as any other big conference), the
feedback we received so far were very positive. We were able to bring
amazing speakers to the conference, which brought high-level content
even for beginners.</p>
<h2 id="organizers">Organizers</h2>
<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-organizersb.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-organizers.jpg" alt="All organizers in the corridor of our rented AirBnb place" title="Almost all Rust LATAM organizers"></a></p>
<p>This post does not name people because I don&rsquo;t know how much they
feel comfortable to be mentioned here, but there&rsquo;s someone that
needs to be mentioned, and this person is <a href="https://twitter.com/spastorino">Santiago
Pastorino</a>. As the conference happened
in Montevideo (Uruguay), Santiago was the main organizer and main
contact to everything local to the place. He was the one doing the
heavy lifting for most of the things related to this conference, and he
has my full respect for that (and many other things).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we (other organizers) did some hard work too and I
would mention others by name. We joined in different stages of
the conference organization and committed ourselves in different
levels, Santiago was the only one who started it and was there until
we delivered it with the same level of commitment, that&rsquo;s why I
decided only to mention him by name.</p>
<p>I made some new friends while organizing this conference. It&rsquo;s great
to see how you become friends with someone after you spend some days
doing hard work and feeling the same pains and joys. At the end of the
conference, I felt I knew these people for years already, and it was
just 4-5 days working together. Of course, we had many interactions via
internet, but it didn&rsquo;t happen to all of them, and it was less
intense. I would say that the level of commitment to the same cause is
proportional to the bonding of the friendship.</p>
<h2 id="attendees">Attendees</h2>
<p>We generated a chart about the demographics using the data from
everyone who attended the conference. Here&rsquo;s the data we have for
that:</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-demographics.png" title=""><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-demographics.png" alt="A pie chart showing the demographics of the conference" title="Demographics"></a></p>
<p><strong>Errata:</strong> After the conference someone noticed that Mexico was not
included in the legend of the demographics chart when we presented in
the opening speech, so I&rsquo;m posting the right data now. It was my
fault, sorry Mexico! The Rust LATAM community loves you! 🇲🇽</p>
<p>60%+ of the participants were Uruguayans. We were expecting that
already since many of them were students. We did (Thanks Santiago!)
some presentations at local universities to promote the conference and
the language.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have any problems with any of the attendees. Everyone
behaved as expected for the standards of the Rust community and I hope
many met some new friends to exchange information about Rust.</p>
<p>Rust still has a small community in LATAM, but we&rsquo;re trying to make it
better with this conference. :)</p>
<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>
<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-speakers.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-speakers.jpg" alt="All speakers and organizers on stage" title="Speakers"></a></p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m also counting the workshop speakers not only the ones who
were speaking on stage on Saturday.</p>
<p>In the end, everything ran smoothly with the speakers. One speaker was
not feeling well during the conference and we were worried about this
person and also for the possible slot e would have to fill but the
speaker was able to deliver the talk (which was great, BTW 😁).</p>
<p>All speakers performed great (even when Apple Keynote decides not to
cooperate 😜) thanks a lot to all of you that gave us your time and
knowledge to make this conference happen. ❤️</p>
<h2 id="brazilians">Brazilians</h2>
<p>Yes, Brazilians deserve a topic. :)</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/rustlatam-brazilians.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/rustlatam-brazilians.jpg" alt="All brazilians on stage after the conference in a unofficial picture" title="Brazilians"></a></p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know yet (for some reason), I&rsquo;m Brazilian. It&rsquo;s
not so common for people in Brazil to go to different countries (I may
be generalizing, but that&rsquo;s my feeling), mainly because Brazil is
so huge. I was amazed to see we had more people from Brazil than
people from Argentina there. 🎉</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common thing to have this &ldquo;Brazil x Argentina&rdquo; thing (because
of soccer&hellip;), so I was joking about the number of participants. To be
honest, I was happy to see that we were considering each other as
fellow programmers of the Rust LATAM community and not people from
country X or Y.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://t.me/rustlangbr">Rust Brasil</a> chat on Telegram that
has 600+ members. There we have members from many different Brazilian
states; it&rsquo;s a place to unite all the local meetups like Rust-SP (São
Paulo), Rust-BH (Minas Gerais), etc. It was the first time we had
a more significant meeting where people from different places could come to meet
and talk to other Brazilian Rustaceans. We had an internal joke that
it would be the first meeting of Rust Brasil&hellip;in Uruguay!</p>
<h2 id="what-went-well">What went well</h2>
<p>The whole conference went well. We feel that people are satisfied with
what we were able to deliver. We collected some feedback and the
general feeling was excellent.</p>
<p>It seems we were able to do everything on budget as well, so we didn&rsquo;t
have to spend our own [personal] money to deliver the conference and
help speakers and organizers to get to Uruguay. <strong>This was only
possible because we had amazing sponsors to help us with that. Thanks
Rust LATAM sponsors!</strong>.</p>
<p>We were able to deliver a pre-conference meetup, one day of workshops,
and one day of talks. Considering the size of the team and how busy we
were, it was almost a miracle (IMO). 🎉</p>
<p>The venue for the conference was great. We didn&rsquo;t have any problem at
all with it. <strong>Thanks a lot to Antel for providing it</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="problems-we-had-and-what-has-to-improve">Problems we had and What has to improve</h2>
<p>Of course, there were many problems. The simple ones, the complicated
ones, the funny ones, etc. We hope they were not apparent for the
participants and speakers. :)</p>
<h3 id="number-of-organizers-and-commitment">Number of organizers and commitment</h3>
<p>We had fewer organizers than we wanted to have. Some of us were able to
commit more than others, so we had to bring more people to the core
group of organizers. Some of us had to leave the group in the middle
of the process because they were too busy with other things; others
were there but not able to do much. This whole situation made
everything even more difficult.</p>
<p>Next time we should probably get more people and more commitment in
the beginning so it will be easier to afford losing people in the
process without overwhelming everyone.</p>
<h3 id="food-and-places">Food and places</h3>
<p>We had some problems related to food and the usage of one of the
workshops place. We paid for something and it was delivered in a
different way than what was agreed. There was probably some
miscommunication in the process, but it&rsquo;s hard to know how much of it
was on purpose or just unprofessional.</p>
<h3 id="intro-to-rust-workshop">Intro to Rust Workshop</h3>
<p>The initial plan was not to have any wokshop, but we were considering
having one done by us. In the end, we got awesome people to deliver
workshops, and we could have spared ours.</p>
<p>After some discussion, we thought it would be great to deliver
our workshop still because there were many students enrolled and it would be
a good thing for them. It proved to be accurate because it was the
biggest workshop we had.</p>
<p>The only problem is that it had to be delivered in Spanish and we had
just two native Spanish speakers organizers attending the
conference. Santiago became the responsible for the workshop.</p>
<p>The problem of having Santiago doing the workshop is that he was
already doing all the other things that needed someone from Uruguay
and didn&rsquo;t have enough time to work on it. We slept less than we
wanted and finished the whole slides and exercises together in the day
before (which reminded us of our university times! LOL).</p>
<p>We already had the content for the workshop, but now Santiago was
&ldquo;trapped into a room&rdquo; for the whole day. Many things were only known
by him (contracts, discussions by phone, etc.) because he was the one
dealing with locals. Well, in the end, he became the single point of
failure of the conference.</p>
<p>We managed to fix everything by covering him during the workshop
exercises but it was not an easy task to do.</p>
<p>It was great to have an <em>Intro to Rust</em> workshop, but we did not plan
it in the right way. Next time we will probably have someone other than
the main organizer doing that! LOL.</p>
<h2 id="backstage-stories">Backstage stories</h2>
<p>Well, we have some interesting stories from backstage to tell
you. 😁</p>
<h3 id="having-fun-with-the-language-mess">Having fun with the language mess</h3>
<p>It was hilarious to have Italian, English, Spanish, and Portuguese
all mixed up between the organizers and locals. We used English as the
lingua-franca between us (where&rsquo;s Esperanto? :P) but we also had to
deal with locals that only speak Spanish (venue, catering, etc.), so
we had to switch languages from time to time.</p>
<p>I remember when one of us was speaking Italian to the Spanish speaker
organizer by mistake. His face was: &ldquo;Why is he not understanding
me?&rdquo;. Very funny.</p>
<p>There was also one time when we were discussing the workshop (2 AM)
and the Spanish speaker read something in Spanish in an e-mail and
after that, this person made the switch to Spanish while we were
looking to him/her laughing and trying to understand what he was
talking about.</p>
<p>I have to say that I had <strong>a lot of fun</strong> with these situations :)</p>
<h3 id="lost-backpack">Lost backpack</h3>
<p>We were using a rideshare app to go from one place to another. We had
to bring boxes of t-shirts, bags, banners, and other things to the
place we were staying. You can imagine that the logistics were not easy.</p>
<p>In one of these rides, one of us took the boxes but forgot to get the
backpack from the car before leaving. We tried to contact the driver,
but it&rsquo;s not that easy to do that using this app in Uruguay.</p>
<p>When we finally could get an answer for the driver, he said that there
was no backpack there&hellip; That&rsquo;s nothing to do about it other than
report it to the police.</p>
<p>Well, it was awful for the organizer (and for the whole
conference organization), but it became even worse when we found that
this person&rsquo;s passport was also in the backpack. We started the
process of getting a new passport during the workshops day so him/her
would be able to get home in time. It&rsquo;s a long and stressful process.</p>
<h3 id="trapped-organizer">Trapped organizer</h3>
<p>One of us was out to bring the tablecloths for the sponsors'
table. When this person got to the place, it was almost closing, and
he/she got trapped into the garage. One of us had to go there to
release him/her but this person was able to release [him/her]self
before we arrive. :P</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Organizing an international conference is tough. It took a
lot of my time in the past 3-4 months. There are so many details to
consider, and sometimes basic things you consider as done comes back to
bite you.</p>
<p>The feeling of accomplishing something that big with positive
feedback is something that you take for life. I&rsquo;m very proud of being
part of the team that made it happen.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; The best way to end this post is to thank everyone (attendees,
sponsors, speakers, organizers, etc.) who were there to make it
happen. 🦀</p>

            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/atreus-firmware/</link>

            <description>I just bought an Atreus keyboard and I&amp;rsquo;m now configuring my own firmware.
To do that, I&amp;rsquo;m using the qmk_firmware.
I&amp;rsquo;m adding a new file as a layout (link here) and I have to change tmk_core/common/avr/bootloader.c to be able to compile it:
-uint32_t reset_key __attribute__ ((section (&amp;quot;.noinit&amp;quot;))); +uint32_t reset_key __attribute__ ((section (&amp;quot;.noinit,\&amp;quot;aw\&amp;quot;,@nobits;&amp;quot;))); After that, I just had to get the keyboard to the reset mode via fn + ESC (to change the layout) and then pressed the RESET button.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just bought an Atreus keyboard and I&rsquo;m now configuring my own firmware.</p>
<p>To do that, I&rsquo;m using the <code>qmk_firmware</code>.</p>

<code>tmk_core/common/avr/bootloader.c</code> to be able to compile it:</p>
<pre><code>-uint32_t reset_key  __attribute__ ((section (&quot;.noinit&quot;)));

</code></pre><p>After that, I just had to get the keyboard to the reset mode via <code>fn + ESC</code> (to
change the layout) and then pressed the RESET button. I had to refer to the map
for the current layot to find the keys but after that, it went smoothly.</p>
<p>To compile the firmware you want, just use <code>make</code> and specify the keyboard and layout:</p>
<pre><code>make keyboard=atreus keymap=pothix
</code></pre><p>In this case, I have a keymap called &ldquo;pothix&rdquo; at <code>qmk_firmware/keyboards/atreus/keymaps</code>.
To flash the firmware, I used the <code>avrdude</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo avrdude -p atmega32u4 -c avr109 -U flash:w:atreus_pothix.hex -P /dev/ttyACM0
</code></pre><p>The result will be something like:</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Guess what!? Yes, metrics for June! 📊</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t count how many books I read, I just track and check at
the end of the month. When I saw that I read five books read this
month, my face was like 😱. All of them received a 4-star review, so
the result is quite good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2LdZT3q">Managing Oneself</a>: This is a great
book. It&rsquo;s not life-changing, but there are many great tips to
improve your life. It was almost 5 stars for me. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1622218584">Check my review to
find my notes</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2uuv1RO">A Filosofia Explica as Grandes Questões da
Humanidade</a>: This book is in pt-BR, if you
speak Portuguese and want a light (and quite funny) introduction to
philosophy book, this may be the one.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Jm6rZ2">The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There
Are No Easy Answers</a>: A good book for
CTOs. It was also an excellent reading for me since I saw many of those
problems happening during my career 😅. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m the
right audience, but it&rsquo;s a good book overall. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2285173161">Here is my review and
notes</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to2NT4qXs">Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind
How Video Games Are Made</a>: If you like
games, especially what is under the hood (not just to play them) you
will have a good time reading this book. I&rsquo;m a big fan of games and
always try to build my own just for fun. The gaming industry is
tough, you will understand why by reading this book.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NSlbCf">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the
Future</a>: A good one but I think I had high expectations. I recommend reading anyway, especially if you want to build a startup in the future (or already have one).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a full review for all books I read. Sometimes I
mention some of them here, but you can find all of them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my
Goodreads account</a>.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m still experimenting with <a href="https://ifttt.com/p/pothix">an integration between Pocket and Google
Spreadsheets via IFTTT</a>. I&rsquo;m adding a tag
to the articles I read and want to include in my list of <em>articles
read</em> for the month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/pocket-articles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/pocket-articles.png" alt="Articles read this month" title="Articles read this month"></a></p>
<p>I use a <code>SUMIF</code> to sum all lines containing the YEARMONTH tag and it
shows I got <strong>27 articles read</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this with the old method:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1539,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:2.47,&quot;read&quot;:1146,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.36}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1573,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:2.16,&quot;read&quot;:1173,&quot;read_pct&quot;:2.3}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1573 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1173 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1539 unread</strong>
and <strong>1146 read</strong>), I got around <strong>2.16% more unread articles</strong> and
<strong>2.3% more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>1173 <em>(read this month)</em> - 1146 <em>(read prev. month)</em> = <strong>27</strong> <em>(the number in the spreadsheet)</em></p>
<p>It seems my spreadsheet tracking is working as expected. 🎉 I have to
think if it&rsquo;s a good thing to lose the number of articles added, but
I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s bringing that much value in the current
situation.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Emacs is superior this month. I don&rsquo;t remember seeing any uptrend during the month though. 🤔</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than the other months. It&rsquo;s interesting to see that Sunday
was one of the days I programmed the most. 🤔 Usually, it&rsquo;s related to
my presentations (rehearsing live coding) or writing this blog post,
which makes <code>markdown</code> to be on the top of the list of languages. 😅</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>And now we have a surprise! <strong>Rust</strong> is the most used language this
month with <strong>more than 32% of my usage</strong>. 😱</p>
<p>The reason for that is my gaming with Rust presentation this month. I
plan to do some live coding, in the same way, I did for Python,
Javascript, and Ruby in the past. It is taking almost all my spare
time, but it&rsquo;s also a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Thanks to my monthly posts and lengthy posts on
<a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> (that I write in Emacs), <strong>Markdown</strong> is
in the second position.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong> is my first language nowadays and <strong>Ruby</strong> is used when I
work as a freelancer full-stack developer (for the same company, for
more than 2 years now).</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>This month I spoke about the same topic as <a href="https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br">my
book</a> at <a href="https://www.sympla.com.br/desconstruindo-a-web__262326">Impacta
tecnologia</a>.</p>
<p>Still related to this presentation: this month also marks the
milestone of 1000 copies of my book sold, which is incredible. I promised
to write about it, hope to have a post soon.</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p>This time I could take the screenshot at the right time so we can
compare. It seems stable, but I can see an improvement there. It is quite unreliable to use the number of tasks as it can be &ldquo;drink water&rdquo; or &ldquo;implement a complex system&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m OK with that. 😀</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>1 days and 8 hours</strong> of podcast time. A little bit less than the last month, but as usual, the decrease of time listening Podcast correlates a lot with the number of books read (listen). 👍</p>
<p>Here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely comfortable with this list. It doesn&rsquo;t tell a true story. I listen to many good and small podcasts, and they are not part of this list because the long ones usually take their place. As an example, I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping this list here because it shows some of the Podcasts I
follow, but I will probably find the best way to do that. I will
probably export a file every month and post it here. 👍</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software
(<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>) comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>June 21st I was at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pt/summits/sao-paulo/">AWS Summit São Paulo 2018</a>.</p>
<p>I had 19 work days tracked this month, and I worked for 160 hours,
which mean that <strong>I worked 8 hours more than I should</strong> (more than I
had last month, which was 5 hours). It&rsquo;s quite bad since I worked 1
day more than I should. <strong>The goal is to reach 8 hours and remove
those bars that exceed the 9h threshold</strong>. Currently, it&rsquo;s not a huge
problem, but I want to be able to stabilize it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>Last month I was discussing each item of the Deep work, but I will get
back to discussing Shallow work only since it&rsquo;s what concerns me the
most. Deep work is useful, sometimes it&rsquo;s not coding, but it&rsquo;s related
and meaningful work.</p>
<p>For shallow work, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meeting time</strong> is stable (and productive), considering two 1-1
meetings (1 hour each) and four weekly meetings (around 40 minutes
each)</li>
<li><strong>Read/Reply Twist</strong> is stable but still consuming much time,
more than 2 hours every day.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch/Break</strong> is now complete! I&rsquo;m spending around 26 hours in
lunch/break. Considering that I had 19 days of work, it&rsquo;s less than
1.5 hours. I should stop and stretch more than I&rsquo;m doing now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check the Twist usage by hour (previous month first, this month
after):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a></p>
<p>No significant changes, and as I said in my previous review, I&rsquo;m not that
satisfied with this chart. The perfect chart for me would have a small
peak at 9-10, almost no usage between 10-13, a giant peak between 14
and 16 and less usage from 16 to 21. That performance is what would be more
productive to me according to the <a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf">daily when
tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue with my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>

<p>What an improvement! It&rsquo;s probably related to my presentation since I&rsquo;m
rehearsing it a lot. 😅</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>

<p>My pulse is worst this month. I&rsquo;m still tracking my Telegram usage since it&rsquo;s the most used application of the <em>Very distracting</em>
category. Here is the comparison from the previous month to the
current one:</p>

<p>It seems the usage increased. I don&rsquo;t know why yet.</p>
<p>Comparing Telegram usage by time of the day, we have (last month
first, <strong>this month second</strong>):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that used in my peak times, but it seems to be the opposite
of Twist usage. I have to work on that.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>

<p>This month I have almost <strong>8k steps</strong> compared to 7k from the previous month. 🎉</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check my weight:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice, but it doesn&rsquo;t show what I want. If you look by the 90 days
perspective using <a href="https://myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a>, we have a
better picture of that:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight-myfitnesspal.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight-myfitnesspal.png" alt="Weight in the last 90 days via MyFitnessPal" title="Weight in the last 90 days via MyFitnessPal"></a></p>
<p>My plan to lose a little bit of weight is finally on the way. 👍</p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Good to see it&rsquo;s improving every month. 🙃</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a>, I watched just 1
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably related to the last episode of <strong>Sense 8</strong>.</p>
<p>I forgot to get my data from <a href="https://trakt.tv">trakt.tv</a> at the beginning of this month. The current version already includes some other TV shows. I will keep last month&rsquo;s version here for reference.</p>
<p>[<img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows-trakt.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to trakt" title="TV shows watched this month according to trakt">](/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows-trakt.jpg &ldquo;)</p>
<p>The most important part is in blue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TV Shows</strong>: 31d 22h 50m</li>
<li><strong>Movies</strong>: 10d 15h 22m</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>47147</strong> words written (<strong>38747</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>595</strong> corrections made (<strong>385</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>10973</strong> unique words (<strong>11213</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that I&rsquo;m writing more but not with a better vocabulary 😞. I&rsquo;m
not sure if it&rsquo;s related to the fact that I&rsquo;m not tracking everything
I type in <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> anymore. 🤔</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the previous and this month, the previous first and
<strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .

<p>One new city popped out, and according to Google locations, it&rsquo;s São Paulo 🤔.</p>
<p>A little bit more time in a vehicle. It seems that I&rsquo;m getting out of
the cavern more nowadays 😅</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .

<p>Still many kilometers to &ldquo;reach the moon&rdquo;:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💰</p>
<p>This month I spend 29% of my earnings, which is still below my
expectations (40%). This 29% are distributed into the following
categories (in pt-BR):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>I see more general expenses (<em>Compras</em>) than I would like. Gifts and
donations ( <em>Presentes / Doações</em>) are quite high this month because
of my parents in law health insurance. I decided to add it to the
<em>donations</em> category because I&rsquo;m already using the Family one
(<em>Família / Filhos</em>) to track the expenses with my dog. 😅</p>
<p>We spent a lot with Doctors and medicines this month (<em>Saúde</em>), but I hope it
will not be a recurrent expense.</p>
<p>My total savings <strong>increased by 1.32%</strong> this month, and now I have
<strong>95.35%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important metric to understand if it worth taking the time to
write it. So:</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 40 minutes to write it</strong></p>
<p>It was a good time considering my average. 🎉</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It was quite hard to take the time to write down this post, but I&rsquo;m
glad I did it. I feel excellent when I read my accomplishments every
month. ☺</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>

<p>Two books read this month, but both received a 3 stars review:
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a full review for each book I read. You can find
them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my Goodreads account</a>.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m experimenting with <a href="https://ifttt.com/p/pothix">an integration between Pocket and Google
Spreadsheets via IFTTT</a>. The idea is not
to use Javascript codes anymore, but it&rsquo;s still ongoing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding a tag to the articles I read and want to include in my list
of <em>articles read</em> for the month. For this month, I&rsquo;m using the tag
<code>201805</code>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/pocket-articles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/pocket-articles.png" alt="Articles read this month" title="Articles read this month"></a></p>
<p>I use a <code>SUMIF</code> to sum all lines containing the string <code>201805</code>, and
got <strong>26 articles read</strong>.</p>
<p>I did not start at the beginning of the month, and it should be
considered just an experiment for now. I hope to soon change to this
method of collecting data about the articles read.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s worth keeping the old method:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1501,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:3.66,&quot;read&quot;:1096,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.2}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1539,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:2.47,&quot;read&quot;:1146,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.36}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1539 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1146 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1501 unread</strong>
and <strong>1096 read</strong>), I got around <strong>2.47% more unread articles</strong> and
<strong>4.36% more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>Still adding more than reading (😕), but I&rsquo;m still not sure if this is
a problem. I may never read all those articles I marked to <em>read
later</em>, but does it really matter? 🤔</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new here, 70-30 between Vim and Emacs.</p>

<p>Not that bad.</p>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is back as the first language because of some big posts I
had to write using Emacs. <strong>Python</strong> is the second most used language
because of <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> and
<a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>, and <strong>Ruby</strong> is still present there 😉.</p>
<p>This month I had a little bit of <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Go</strong>, which is nice. I think I
will have more Rust next month. 😀</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>No talks this month as well 😕, but one scheduled for the next month. 👍</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>

<p>Things are better this month! Hope to remember to take the screenshot
before the week cycle ends next month.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days and 18 hours</strong> of podcast time. Here is the list of Podcasts
and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this list is based on time. <code>Anticast</code> is not a Podcast
I&rsquo;m used to listening, but they have some good episodes from time to
time. The problem is that they are quite long (~1h30) while other
shows tend to have episodes of about 30min.</p>
<p>Well, keep in mind that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking
time instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear
as &ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>I had 21 work days tracked this month, and I worked for 173 hours,
which mean that <strong>I worked 5 hours more than I should</strong> (the same as I
had in April). Not bad but <strong>the goal is to reach 8 hours and remove
those bars that exceed the 9h threshold</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>I decided to track my <em>lunch/break time</em>, so I can understand how much
time I&rsquo;m spending on tasks that are not related to work at all
(reading emails, talking to people via Telegram, etc.). Unfortunately,
I started this too late. I have only 10 hours of lunch break so we
will have to skip it to the next month.</p>
<p>I have to be more descriptive with Deep work. I&rsquo;m trying to keep
<em>Writing</em> and <em>Read/Reply Twist</em> as the same thing, maybe it will be
better next month. I&rsquo;m also stunned by the small number tracked as
deep work <em>coding</em>. This month I spent far more time discussing and
writing things down than actually coding. 😕</p>
<p>For shallow work, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meeting time</strong> is stable (and productive), considering two 1-1
meetings (1 hour each) and four weekly meetings (around 40 minutes
each)</li>
<li><strong>Read/Reply Twist</strong> is still consuming a lot of time, more than 2
hours every day.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch/Break</strong> is still work in progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m looking into all the data, I found it interesting that
<strong>1/3 of my time is spent communicating</strong>. 🤔</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check the Twist usage by hour (previous month first, this month
after):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that satisfied with this chart. The perfect chart for me would
have a small peak at 9-10, almost no usage between 10-13, a giant peak
between 14 and 16 and less usage from 16 to 21. I should have no usage
after 21.</p>
<p>The usage I described above is precisely the opposite of what is my
productive time. I used the <a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf">daily when
tracker</a>
and found the times I&rsquo;m more alert and energetic. As usual, I should
post about it as well but never do. 😕</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely better! We should consider the holiday for this month,
though. 😛</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>My productivity pulse is better this month. <a href="/post/stats-may-2018/">Last
month</a> I did some research on what happened and
found that Magic the Gathering was taking a lot of my time and also
adding some outliers, it seems to be better now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still following my Telegram usage, here is the comparison from the
previous month to the current one:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>

<p>It seems to be better but not much. I have an alert of my time spent
using Telegram, but when it fires, it&rsquo;s usually too late. Working on
it.</p>
<p>Comparing Telegram usage by time of the day, we have (last month
first, this month second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>

<p>It improved a little bit during my peak times. I will consider that as
an improvement and keep working on it.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>

<p>This month I have <strong>7k steps</strong> compared to 8k from the previous month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back to the gym, but my weight is still the same. I hope to have a
big improvement next month:</p>

<p>Better sleeping! That&rsquo;s good news! 🙃</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 8
episode this month:</p>

<p>These episodes are related to the new season of <strong>13 reasons why</strong> and
<strong>The End of the F***ing world</strong>.</p>
<p>I mentioned that I&rsquo;m trying <a href="https://trakt.tv">trakt.tv</a>, and I&rsquo;m
still getting used to it. This is what I&rsquo;m going to use:</p>

<p>As you can see, I can also track movies. The only data that matters is
the following:</p>

<p>I know I&rsquo;m still missing some movies and TV shows there, hope to add
them as soon as I remember.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>38747</strong> words written (<strong>61385</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>385</strong> corrections made (<strong>934</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>11213</strong> unique words (<strong>16473</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grammarly is not working good inside Twist anymore, I don&rsquo;t know
why. I will have to reach out to Grammarly again soon.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added some places to the list:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-places.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-places.png" alt="Places I visited" title="Places I visited"></a></p>
<p>Other than that, no new cities or countries. 😞</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the previous and this month, the previous first and
<strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data this month" title="General view of my locations data this month"></a></p>
<p>One new city popped out, but I have no idea which one it is. Maybe it
is the lost city from the last report. 🤷‍♂</p>
<p>My time commuting improved a lot this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance this month" title="Location time and distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Still many kilometers to &ldquo;reach the moon&rdquo;:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💰</p>
<p>This month I spend 32% of my earnings, which is still below my
expectations (40%). This 32 % are distributed into the following
categories (in pt-BR):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>We spent more with <em>Mercado</em> (groceries) than expected (last month it
was just 3%), hope to adjust it for the next month.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m not considering the money in transit from my company to
my personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant
payment, etc.).  So, without considering it, my total savings
<strong>increased by 0.06%</strong>. This is a good number given the current
scenario of the Brazilian economy (it&rsquo;s positive because I added
money, or it would be negative), and now I have <strong>94.11%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important metric to understand if it worth taking the time to
write it. So:</p>
<p><strong>It took 5 hours and 12 minutes to write it</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more than I expected, but I think it&rsquo;s happening because I was
researching different services and also doing some research on how to
conduct my investments. Hope to decrease this time next month.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It took a lot of time to write this post, and this is bad, but other
than that, the month was good in general. All my goals for this month
were met, so I have nothing to complain. ✌</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>

            <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for April metrics! 📊
Books Note: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on my Goodreads account.
Again, just one book this month, and again, a 5 stars one!

A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy. This book was on my reading list for many months now. After reading it, I realized I&amp;rsquo;m practicing a fraction of Stoicism for many years.</description>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my Goodreads account</a>.</p>
<p>Again, just one book this month, and again, a 5 stars one!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2KgEAKE">A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</a>. This book was on my reading list for many months now. After reading it, I realized I&rsquo;m practicing a fraction of Stoicism for many years. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2355647662">Here is my review</a> if you want to read my thoughts on it.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from
<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and a script that look like the one I
used last month. Here is the script with the actual data:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1446,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:1.8,&quot;read&quot;:1050,&quot;read_pct&quot;:2.86}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1501,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:3.66,&quot;read&quot;:1096,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.2}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1501 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1096 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1446 unread</strong>
and <strong>1050 read</strong>), I got around <strong>3.6% more unread articles</strong> and
<strong>4.2% more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m reading more than adding, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m happy with
this situation. It&rsquo;s been some months since I&rsquo;m complaining about my
<em>read it later</em> but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m experimenting with an integration between <a href="https://ifttt.com/p/pothix">Pocket + Google Sheets
via IFTTT</a>. The idea is to count the
number of articles read and maybe we will have something new next month.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new here, 70-30 between Vim and Emacs.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>I had some national holidays + days off this month. Also, I had some
non-coding tasks (mostly writing) and it obviously impacted my hours
of coding.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p><code>Python</code>, <code>Markdown</code>, and <code>Ruby</code> are the most used languages, as
usual. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no mention of <code>Rust</code> or <code>Elixir</code> this
month, but at least I have a small percentage of <code>Golang</code>.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>Again, no speaking this month. I was thinking about it, and I think it
is a hangover from the 21 presentations from last year.</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p>Things are back to normal, I guess. 🙃</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>3 days and 6 hours</strong> of podcast time. It seems that 3 days is
becoming average for me. As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and
their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>Remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear as
&ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>I had 19 work days tracked this month, and I worked for 157 hours,
which mean that <strong>I worked 5 hours more than I should</strong> (it was 11 in
the last month, so it&rsquo;s improving! 😀).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings are stable (and productive), considering two 1-1 meetings
(1 hour each) and four weekly meetings (around 40 minutes each)</li>
<li>The Shallow work task (the most generic I have) is still the big
black box. I mentioned to split the lunch time (lunch and break) but
forgot to do that last month. Maybe I will start doing it this
month (from April 15th).</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo; is still consuming a lot of time, more than 2 hours
every day. Let&rsquo;s break Twist usage down by hour:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a></p>
<p>It seems that my strategy of reading Twist in the morning is working,
but it&rsquo;s not fixing the problem of keep looking to it throughout the
day. I should probably just skim it in the morning and get back to it
at the end of the day. Still trying to improve this process though.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s not much to compare here, but at least it seems stable. 👍</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worst than February and March 😞. I had a pulse of 62 on February and 54 on March, and it&rsquo;s now 43. It concerns to see that, so I decided what was causing such different. When looking at the chart for the entertaining category, I saw this:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-distracting.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-distracting.png" alt="RescueTime distracting chart" title="RescueTime distracting chart"></a></p>
<p>It seems that my new (and old, at the same time) hobby Magic the
Gathering is taking a lot of my spare time. I let rescuetime track all
my time, not just working hours, and all MTG websites are considered
as very distracting. Maybe I should configure rescuetime to monitor
only &ldquo;working hours&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not sure what time should I use. 🤔</p>
<p>Still following my Telegram usage, here is the comparison from the
previous month to the current one:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still too high for me. I have an alert of my time spent using
Telegram. The goal is not to receive this alert, but I&rsquo;m currently
failing at it. I have to improve this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to understand if I have a particular moment where I
use Telegram the most, here is the difference from the last month to
the current one:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>Hm, Telegram usage is spread throughout the day, that&rsquo;s not a good
thing. I have to keep working on it.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity-comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/activity_comparison.jpg" alt="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>This month I have <strong>8k steps</strong> compared to 10.5k from the previous
month. This change is expected since I had two weeks to move around because
of the retreat and my vacation in Santiago last month.</p>
<p>I was expecting a big change in my weight, but it was not that bad. I&rsquo;m expecting an increase next month though 😅:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Not that bad, the same as March. Hope to improve it in May. 👍</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 8
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>We finished <strong>The punisher</strong> this month. Now looking for a new TV show
to watch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to try <a href="https://trakt.tv">trakt.tv</a>, so I can try the
movies I watch along with the TV shows. Unfortunately, tvshowtime only
tracks TV shows. Maybe we will have some new charts next month. 😉</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>61385</strong> words written ( <strong>50348</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>934</strong> corrections made (<strong>825</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>16473</strong> unique words (<strong>10944</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected to have a better value since last month had almost two
weeks off because of Doist retreat + vacations. Nothing outstanding
though.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added some places to the list:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-places.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-places.png" alt="Places I visited" title="Places I visited"></a></p>
<p>Went to two different cities this month, one of them is 450km+ from my
hometown. ✌</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the difference between last month and this month. Last
month first and <strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data this month" title="General view of my locations data this month"></a></p>
<p>And again, One new country according to Google. It&rsquo;s quite unstable to rely on their country count, but I think they got it right now. The number of cities did not increase for some reason. 🤷‍♂</p>
<p>As expected the amount of time commuting increased a lot this month (due to the travel I mentioned above):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance this month" title="Location time and distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Still many kilometers to &ldquo;reach the moon&rdquo;:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💰</p>
<p>My earnings this month were different from what I usually receive. All of this thanks to the profit sharing I receive from my previous employer. Considering that, I spent only 17% of the money earned this month.</p>
<p>From this 17%, we have the following percentages:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>I was expecting much more from <em>Viagem</em> (traveling, the orange piece),
but it&rsquo;s good enough. <em>Transport</em> is the biggest one, but part of it
will probably be reimbursed, as it&rsquo;s my wife&rsquo;s work expenses. With that said, <em>Moradia</em> (housing?) is my most significant expense.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m not considering the money in transit from my company to
my personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant
payment, etc.). So, without considering it, and keeping in mind that
Easynvest (one of my brokers) has a crappy system that doesn&rsquo;t work,
making me waste my time trying to retrieve the latest information
about my investments, my total savings <strong>increased by almost 4% (!!)</strong>
and now I have <strong>94.06%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 31 minutes</strong></p>
<p>It is quite stable since I spent 3 hours and 30 minutes last month. That
number considers the whole process of organizing my data (I usually
review my investment portfolio as well), taking screenshots, and
writing this post.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It was a standard month. Some outliers were found because of my
Magic The Gathering hobby and 20+ hours commuting because of my
travels is not that common, but other than that, everything is just
fine.</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>

Books Note: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on my Goodreads account.
Just one book this month, but a 5 stars one:

When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing. This book is about optimization based on time and energy. What is the best time to do some action based on statistics? I found it to be amazing and could confirm many of the assumptions with my data.</description>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2v3yIBB">When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect
Timing</a>. This book is about optimization
based on time and energy. What is the best time to do some action
based on statistics? I found it to be amazing and could confirm
many of the assumptions with my data. I would recommend everyone
who likes to improve their performance to read this book and draw
their conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from
<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and a script that look like the one I
used last month. Here is the script with the actual data:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1420,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:4.79,&quot;read&quot;:1020,&quot;read_pct&quot;:1.18}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1446,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:1.8,&quot;read&quot;:1050,&quot;read_pct&quot;:2.86}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1446 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1050 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1420 unread</strong>
and <strong>1020 read</strong>), I got around <strong>1.8% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>2.8%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>The percentages are better this month, and this is a good thing. I&rsquo;m
happy to see that I read 30 articles this month. 🙂</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Vim and Emacs usage following the same patterns.</p>

<p>This month was a very particular one since I had the <a href="https://twitter.com/amix3k/status/977808357376626689">Doist
retreat</a> (an
AMAZING experience which deserves a post) and one week vacation. Not
so much coding done.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p><code>Python</code> is my first language but I had some <code>Ruby</code> as
well. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no mention of <code>Rust</code> or <code>Elixir</code> this
month. 😞</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>No speaking this month but I helped organize a workshop about agile
methodologies and how it could help our work at Doist. It was an
excellent experience.</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p>Almost 190 tasks in the week I returned to work. 😅</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>3 days</strong> of podcast time is above average for me. As usual, here is
the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>Remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear as
&ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>It seems quite stable this month.</p>
<p>I had 12 tracked working days this month, and I worked for 107 hours,
which mean that <strong>I worked 11 hours more than I should</strong> (it was also 11 in
the last month with more days tracked 😞).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had more meetings than usual, but it&rsquo;s not too bad</li>
<li>Shallow work is still 55% (better than 64% from February)</li>
<li>The Shallow work task (the most generic I have) is still the big
black box. I&rsquo;m trying not to split the tracking too much, or it will
be too much work to manage it. Maybe it will be useful to
separate lunchtime and other typical things just to check the time
slacking.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo; is still consuming a lot of time, almost 2 hours
every day. I&rsquo;m still fighting to implement my process of checking it
in the morning, add tasks and just review in the afternoon. I should
probably avoid doing it in the morning, but it&rsquo;s still hard for me.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not much to compare here, but at least it seems stable. 👍</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worst than last month 😞. I had a pulse of 62, and it&rsquo;s now 54. I
can&rsquo;t say why it&rsquo;s bad, at least I could not feel anything wrong
during the last month. Maybe it was related to the travel planning.</p>
<p>Still following my Telegram usage, here is the comparison from the
previous month to the current one:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>It seems quite stable, let&rsquo;s wait for the next month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to understand if I have a particular moment where I
use Telegram the most, here is the difference from the last month to
the current one:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>Nothing outstanding but 10:00 is still the time I most use Telegram. It&rsquo;s not
that good since it should be my peak time. I will have to improve my
morning routine. 👍</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added a warning when I use Telegram for more than 30 minutes in
the day. That is helping me to understand my usage pattern.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/activity-comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/activity_comparison.jpg" alt="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>This month was better than the last one. <strong>10.5k steps</strong> compared to
6.5k from previous month. 👍 This is expected since I had two weeks to
move around because of the retreat and my vacation in Santiago.</p>
<p>As I got back in April, it did not reflect on my weight, but the
result will be horrible for the next month 😅:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>I was expecting a decrease this month. During the retreat I did not
sleep that much because I was trying to enjoy every second of that
experience.</p>
<p>This month is an outlier of my routine, but I think it will be back
for the next.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 3
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>But these are the same 3 episodes of the last month, so I did not
watch any tv show this month. ✌</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50348</strong> words written (<strong>72766</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>825</strong> corrections made (<strong>3451</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>10944</strong> unique words (<strong>14352</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing to extract from these metrics since it&rsquo;s different from the
last month because of the retreat + vacations.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Thanks to Doist I visited Chile this month! 🙃</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-countries.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-countries.png" alt="Countries I visited" title="Countries I visited"></a></p>
<p>For some reason, Argentina is on the list as well. I&rsquo;ve been there
already but not this time. :P</p>
<p>I had one week of vacations and decided to walk around Santiago and
relax. Because of that, I&rsquo;ve added many places to the list:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-places.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-places.png" alt="Places I visited" title="Places I visited"></a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the difference between last month and this month. Last
month first and <strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data this month" title="General view of my locations data this month"></a></p>
<p>One new country, 12 cities, and almost 50 more places. Quite nice. 😀</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected to have more commuting, and walking this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .

<p>Still many kilometers to &ldquo;reach the moon&rdquo;:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💸</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/mar/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/mar/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This month I will have to count a big investment in traveling (yes,
traveling for me is an investment in many aspects). It&rsquo;s like that
because I&rsquo;m still paying some of the previous flights and I exchanged
all the money before going to Chile, so I went with cash for the whole
trip.</p>
<p>It seems like I spent around 60% of my income this month, which is not
regular at all. I usually spend about 40% (or less). The monthly
expenses with my home (&ldquo;Moradia&rdquo;) are finally part of the chart now,
and I also added family health care on &ldquo;Outros gastos&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This month is an outlier, but the result is not that bad, IMO. 👍</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m not considering the money in transit from my company to
my personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant
payment, etc.). So, without considering it, my total savings
<strong>increased by 3%</strong> and now I have <strong>90.56%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 30 minutes</strong></p>
<p>That counts the whole process of organizing my data (I usually review
my investment portfolio as well), taking screenshots, and writing this
post.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This was not a normal month at all, but it was really amazing. You
can&rsquo;t see it in my metrics (maybe the locations 🤔) but keep in mind
that not all parts of your life will be on your metrics and that&rsquo;s
OK. I put a lot of effort to create this blog post but I also know
when I should enjoy life and let things go.</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>

            <description>February time! Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we can get from my metrics. 😀
Books Note: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on my Goodreads account.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite satisfied with my reading list for this month:

Five books read in a month and a 4.6 average rating. That&amp;rsquo;s what I call a good reading month.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my Goodreads account</a>.</p>

<p>Five books read in a month and a <strong>4.6 average rating</strong>. That&rsquo;s what I call a good reading month.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2F9ki3C">The Art of Learning: A Journey in the Pursuit of Excellence</a>. This was another fantastic recommendation by <a href="https://twitter.com/amix3k">Amir</a>. The author was a chess prodigy as a kid and an international chess master in the age of 16. He also was highly skilled in Martial arts. In this book, he shows what he extracted from his process of learning during all those years in physical and mental arts. You can read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2269391156">my review on Goodreads</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2tdJzYS">The Richest Man in Babylon</a>. This book is a series of fiction stories using Babylon as the central topic. It&rsquo;s a good book but &ldquo;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&rdquo; ruined it for me. Reason below.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2CWDdwu">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a>. It&rsquo;s a great book. When I was reading it, I asked some friends why they did not recommend it before. There are some great ideas there (depending on your political opinions, you may not like it) and I saw many of them being applied in practice in my own life. It was almost a 5 stars review, but the ending was really dull. I felt he was trying to add more pages to the book.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2taeLbk">The Art of Invisibility</a>. This is the book that makes you paranoid about security (if you care about it). I recommend you to read it if you feel secure using the internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2tgAdM1">Anything You Want</a>. An amazing book. Short, straight to the point, and with killer hints on how to Derek Sivers dealt with his business. I really recommend this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2oF2kje">Gather &lsquo;Round the Sound</a>. This was a free audiobook by Audible. It was nice to listen but nothing astonishing.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from
<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and a script that look like the one I
used last month. Here is the script with the actual data:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1352,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:4.14,&quot;read&quot;:1008,&quot;read_pct&quot;:6.15};

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1420,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:4.79,&quot;read&quot;:1020,&quot;read_pct&quot;:1.18}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1420 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1020 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1352 unread</strong>
and <strong>1008 read</strong>), I got around <strong>4.8% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>It seems that my unread articles list is increasing. My list of unread
increased by just 1%. I&rsquo;m still reading but not enough to take care of
the unread list.</p>
<p>I should probably consider not adding articles there anymore. I just
have to consider if the feeling of adding items &ldquo;for future
reading&rdquo; is worth keeping the system. More on that in the next months.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>My Vim configuration is fixed, and it&rsquo;s back to 15%. 🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the screenshot is not that good, and I&rsquo;m just seeing
that some days after taking it. I will keep it here.</p>
<p>Looking at this chart is interesting. I had one week of vacation,
that you can easily see in the middle of the chart, but after that, I
had 3 days to catch up to a lot of non-coding work to do before going
full-throttle again. I&rsquo;m really interested to see if this is a pattern
in the next holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Finally, I have two programming languages at the top instead of <code>markdown</code>. :P</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not writing on Emacs these days, and this is probably the reason I don&rsquo;t have so much markdown. <code>Python</code> is my first language but I had some <code>Ruby</code> as well. I&rsquo;m quite happy with the results. Hope to have more <code>Rust</code> or
maybe <code>Elixir</code> in the next posts.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>I had one presentation at <a href="http://www.impacta.com.br/">Impacta tecnologia</a> this month. The title was
<a href="http://www.impacta.com.br/eventos/03-02-2018-De-um-arquivo-vazio-ate-um-snake-game-funcionando-usando-Ruby-e-Gosu">Criando um snake game do zero com Ruby e
Gosu</a>. I
built a simple game from scratch, teaching the simple flows of how to
do that using Ruby. It was really nice for me, hope everyone enjoyed
as much as I did.</p>
<p>You can always check my list of talks <a href="/talks">here</a>.</p>
<p>I said that I submitted talks for two conferences last month and both
were rejected. One of them was an excellent fit for the conference, IMO. I
should probably improve my proposals and try again in the future. 🙂</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s reflecting my vacation, but I can see I completed much more tasks
as soon as I got back. If we compare with the amount of coding I did,
it tells me that I had many tasks to do, but they were not related to
coding. 🤔</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that because it makes me feel better when there are not so many
commits done. 👍</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days</strong> of podcast time is the average for me. As usual, it is the
opposite of the number of books I &ldquo;read&rdquo; (listened to).</p>
<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear as
&ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an unusual pattern in this chart. Again, before and after
my vacation I had long working hours (almost 10 hours).</p>
<p>I had 16 working days this month, and I worked for 139 hours, which
mean that <strong>I worked 11 hours more than I should</strong> (it was 13 in the
last month 🎉).</p>
<p>I should probably schedule to work for 7:30 so I would work 8 hours (Brazilian way). 🙄</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost the same proportions I had <a href="/post/stats-jan-2018">in January</a>.</p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had more meetings this month; It&rsquo;s happening because I&rsquo;m a mentor to the other member of my team and there are some onboarding tasks.</li>
<li>Shallow work is still 64%. I said it was less than 50% last month, but I really don&rsquo;t know where did I get this metric. 🤔</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo; is still consuming a lot of time. I changed my
workflow to process all <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> threads quickly
and add <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> task for them. I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s working as expected yet because these threads always take my
attention back to Twist, I have to take the control back. 🙂</p>
<p>The good thing is that it&rsquo;s entirely up to me to improve the way I deal with this problem. I will work on it. 👍</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects, last month first and this month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s improving! I had a talk last month and also some
freelance work to keep my Ruby/Rails skills up-to-date. 💪</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to see that I&rsquo;m back on track to my personal projects. It took around 6 months to stabilize as I predicted.</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>The report is finally working correctly again. The culprit for my non-productive time is Telegram. I&rsquo;m keeping it closed most of the day, but it&rsquo;s still my main communication app.</p>
<p>It looks like I&rsquo;m spending around 40-50 minutes using Telegram on average:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not tracking my cell phone because I usually don&rsquo;t use it enough to
interfere with my productivity and it was just generating noise to my
data. This is why I have almost no activity during vacations.</p>
<p>I was trying to understand if I have a particular moment where I use Telegram the most:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>It seems that around 10:00 is the time I most use Telegram. It&rsquo;s not
that good since it should be my peak time. I will have to improve my
morning routine. 👍</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity-comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity_comparison.jpg" alt="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>The chart shows that it&rsquo;s almost the same as the last month (<strong>6.5k</strong> steps), which is not that bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to the gym almost every day. My goal is to improve my muscles and take care of my left arm after the Bankart and Hill Sachs lesion. As I&rsquo;m not doing cardio exercises, my weight is still good:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>As we can see in the chart, it&rsquo;s almost the same as the last month, and I&rsquo;m happy with that. 👍</p>
<p>Considering the whole user base from mi-band:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" alt="Sleep comparison with the user base" title="Sleep comparison with the user base"></a></p>
<p>This chart only considers the last 7 days. My goal <a href="/post/stats-jan-2018">previous month</a> was to improve my &ldquo;Fell asleep score&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s really better now.</p>
<p>My new routine considers sleeping at 22:30 and waking up between 6 and 6:30. As you can see, it&rsquo;s working really well. 😀</p>
<p>We just have to ignore the deep sleep for the last 7 days. ✌️</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 3
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>I forgot to add it to the app before it was too late. These 3 episodes are related to <strong>Punisher</strong>. 😀</p>
<p>I spent <strong>3 hours</strong> of my life watching TV shows this month&hellip; But I
also watched some movies. I&rsquo;m not tracking films yet because I
usually don&rsquo;t watch that much. Last year I watched less than 10
movies. In case I decide to start watching more movies I will consider
tracking them.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>72766</strong> words written (<strong>71248</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>3451</strong> corrections made (<strong>2039</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>14352</strong> unique words (<strong>12320</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>The corrections made keep increasing, I&rsquo;m sure this is happening because of Grammarly premium. It offers some &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; corrections.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore my locations. Last month first and <strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .

<p>Just visited some places more but no new cities or countries. 😞</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see the time commuting, last month first and this month second:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .

<p>Long hours spent on vehicles this month. I decided to visit my parents, and it requires at least 12 hours on a bus 😬. My time walking is almost the same.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💸</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>The chart seems to be back to normal. The &ldquo;Moradia&rdquo; (kind of a
mortgage) section increased because I was not considering it in the
previous months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not considering the money in transit from my company to my
personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant,
etc.). So, without considering it, my total savings <strong>increased by
3.20%!</strong> Now I have <strong>87.93%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took around 4 hours</strong></p>
<p>It actually was 3:21 in my tracking software, but I spent a little bit
more than that.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s confirmed that I finally have my old routine back. It took almost
10 months to get used to the new job and feel comfortable about my
tasks to be able to focus on other things as well. This is a useful
metric per se. :)</p>
<p>I have a great trip scheduled for March, and it will probably impact my
metrics. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes! :)</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to write this post about my performance for the first month of the year. I think I will have some great news at the end of this post, related to my expenses.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started! 😀
Books I decided to listen to my podcasts this month, so I did not hear that many audiobooks. The only book I read this month was a physical book:

Hiding in unnatural happiness is a book I received from a monk in York.</description>

of the year. I think I will have some great news at the end of this

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started! 😀</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>I decided to listen to my podcasts this month, so I did not hear that many audiobooks. The only book I read this month was a
physical book:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2FcD6PU">Hiding in unnatural happiness</a> is a book I
received from a monk in York. It was the first time I heard about
Krishna, Bhagavad Gita, and some other things. It was an exciting
read, but 3 stars are enough for it.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from
<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and this time I changed the script to
calculate, it will save me some time in the next month:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {unread: 1296, unread_pct: 1.00, read: 946, read_pct: 1.00};
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;var pocket = &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1352,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:4.14,&quot;read&quot;:1008,&quot;read_pct&quot;:6.15}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1352 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1008 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1296 unread</strong>
and <strong>946 read</strong>), I got around <strong>4% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>6%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>A significant increase this month but it&rsquo;s great to see the books read percentage
higher than the read one.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>It looks like my Vim configuration is not working, just fixed that but my
metrics were not collected. 😞</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look correct, unfortunately. Some hours are missing here. 😞</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>As usual, <code>markdown</code> and <code>Python</code> are present. I tried some <code>Rust</code> as
well and did some <code>Ruby</code> coding because of my presentation and some
freelance coding.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>No presentations were done this month. I will not post a chart for that
anymore. I don&rsquo;t have a goal related to it this year.</p>
<p>I submitted talks for two conferences, maybe I will have some good
news next month. 👀</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). It was extracted from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p>It looks stable again! 😀</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>6 days and 3 hours</strong> of podcast time is a personal record for me. Of
course, I did not use 147 hours of my time to listen to Podcasts, I
usually speed-up them, so I would guess it was around 60-70 hours. 😀</p>
<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear as
&ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<p>I would also want to highlight that I <strong>started listening to
<a href="https://philosophizethis.com">Philosophize this podcast</a></strong> and highly
recommend you to try it. I decided to listen to 10 episodes in a row,
starting from episode 1. I usually don&rsquo;t read about philosophy because
the literature is boring as hell, but this podcast explains all the good
parts of it and makes it enjoyable to listen.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m improving! I started to compute the number of hours I&rsquo;m
working in a day. Instead of working until I finish my tasks, I
decided to set up 8 hours to work, and I have to <strong>work smarter</strong> to be
able to include all tasks in this schedule. I highly recommend
this strategy if you want to focus on your work and avoid
over-working.</p>
<p>We had 21 work days this month, and I worked for 181 hours, which mean
that <strong>I worked 13 hours more than I should</strong>. It was the same number
of hours of the last month, but this time it looks more uniform in the
chart.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had fewer meetings this month; this is definitely a good metric. 😀</li>
<li>Had some time invested in hiring, but it&rsquo;s probably done already! 😀</li>
<li>Shallow work decreased from 60% to less than 50%, I&rsquo;m thrilled to see that</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo; is still consuming a lot of time. I changed my
workflow to process all <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> threads quickly
and add <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> task for them. After that, I can
close Twist and focus on my tasks when I feel comfortable to research
what needs to be done and reply to them. This workflow is not showing
its results yet, but maybe we will have something next month. 😉</p>
<p>I will prepare a post about my workflow using <strong>Todoist</strong> and
<strong>Twist</strong> soon.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>That was a good improvement considering I did not have any time
working on personal projects last month.</p>
<p>I decided to add my freelance to this chart so it will not interfere
with my metrics from Doist. Here I have my freelance work and my
talks.</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>I found out that something was not good with my reports. It was
probably related to my change to Firefox quantum. I decided to get
back to Chrome for a while, and I will try Firefox quantum again as
soon as the third party plugins improve.</p>
<p>You can see in the chart the difference when it started reporting the
websites again instead of just showing &ldquo;firefox&rdquo; as neutral time in gray.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>

<p>I got back to the average of <strong>6.5k</strong> steps. Looking into the graph,
it was almost the same as November (I was traveling in December, it
should not count).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back to the gym this month, and it&rsquo;s reflecting in my weight:</p>

<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>As we can see in the chart, it&rsquo;s almost the same but a little bit more deep sleep. 👍</p>
<p>Considering the whole user base from mi-band:</p>

<p>My goal is to change this chart for the last month. I want to be
<strong>above average for the sleeping earlier chart</strong> and hope to have
<strong>more deep sleep</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 22
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>We finished the first season of <strong>Billions</strong>, finished the 4th season
of <strong>Vikings</strong>, and started <strong>Punisher</strong>. 😀</p>
<p>I spent <strong>19 hours</strong> of my life watching TV shows this month.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>71248</strong> words written (<strong>93129</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>2039</strong> corrections made (<strong>1380</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>12320</strong> unique words (<strong>11979</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>I subscribed to Grammarly Premium; maybe this explains the increase in
my number of corrections made, let&rsquo;s wait for the next month to
confirm.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore my locations. Last month first and <strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .

<p>Just visited some places more but no new cities or countries. 😞</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .

<p>I&rsquo;m back to my normal life with just a few hours spent in vehicles. 😀</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>Here we go for what I was expecting! My expenses for this month! 😀</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. I was finally
able to receive the money for my work! It was hard to work for many
months without receiving any payment but finally I could manage to set
up my company in the right way to receive the money. It is a long
story and I should write about it in the future.</p>
<p>I received the money for my full-time job, my freelance, and for a
presentation I did in a private company. It was the first time I
received money for a talk in my entire life, after 40+ talks. 😀</p>
<p>Now looking at the pie chart, I can realize that I&rsquo;m traveling a lot. I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad thing at all. I usually take care of my
expenses when traveling so I can do frugal travels, but the airplane
tickets are usually expensive. I also think the chart is like that
because I don&rsquo;t spend that much money in my day-to-day life, so when I
have expenses that are not common, it dominates the entire chart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not considering the money in transit from my company to my
personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes payment and so
on). So, without considering it, my total savings <strong>increased by
f*cking 13.46%!</strong> Now I have <strong>85.70%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling really good to see my savings growing again! 😀</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took 4 hours and 02 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Back to the old routine and now with a cash flow again. 🙂</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally engaging in the same optimized routine I had in the past,
and I&rsquo;m glad to see that happening again. 🚀</p>

            <title>2017 Year in Review (with metrics!)</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/2017/</link>

            <description>Brace yourselves, this post will be HUGE
TL;DR: It was a great year and I&amp;rsquo;m really glad to see the metrics and notice everything I accomplished.
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I posted my yearly review publicly but as I&amp;rsquo;m doing monthly posts of my stats, it makes sense to do an annual review as well.
I do yearly reviews since around 2005 but I never post them publicly. I also write down my goals for the next year, so I can review them in the last week of the year (like I did some weeks ago).</description>

<p>I do yearly reviews since around 2005 but I never post them
publicly. I also write down my goals for the next year, so I can
review them in the last week of the year (like I did some weeks
ago). I write a lot of content but usually don&rsquo;t publish it because I
try to keep this blog less personal. The stats posts are here because
I really think it&rsquo;s great to have metrics about yourself, so you can
evaluate and improve (remember: continuous improvement). These posts
aim to show that in a practical way while helping me to commit to writing
them monthly.</p>
<p>I will try to follow a template like the one I use for
my <a href="/tags/stats">monthly stats</a> but I will also add some other items
and notes about my goals.</p>
<h3 id="-books">✅ Books</h3>
<p>My yearly goal was to read 30 books this year and I read 31.</p>
<p>Last year I read 42 but I decided to not be so aggressive this year
and try a different strategy. The idea was to add a full review
on <a href="https://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> after the book is finished, so I
can think about how much I understood and retained about it.</p>
<p>The experiment went really well and helped me with the process of
adding more notes about the important parts (IMO) of the book. I&rsquo;m
using <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google keep</a> for that, using a label
for book notes. These notes help me to get into the context of the
book. They are also easy to find using Google Keep&rsquo;s search engine
when I need to find a reference.</p>
<p>Here are the books from this year&rsquo;s list that I really recommend
reading, with links to my review:</p>
<p>Non-Fiction</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1642811841">Mastery</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055058923">What Doesn&rsquo;t Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning will Renew our Lost Evolutionary Strength</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055503546">Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1968545292">Spaceman: An Astronaut&rsquo;s Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Fiction</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2057742804">Rendezvous with Rama</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can always look for my whole
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2017&amp;sort=date_read">list of books read this year on Goodreads</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some stats provided by Goodreads comparing all the books I
have registered:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read by year" title="List of books read by year"></a></p>
<p>I started <a href="/post/audiobooks/">listening to audiobooks</a> in 2016 and it
was a huge difference in my life, as you can see in the charts above.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the books I read this year with last year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/goodreads-details.png" alt="Comparison between 2016 and 2017" title="Comparison between 2016 and 2017"></a></p>
<p>10 books less than last year but it was expected. What bothers me is
that I <strong>only gave 5 stars to 2 books</strong> (comparing to 9 last year)
and <strong>the number of books with 3 starts is higher than the last year</strong>.</p>
<p>The number of books in the &ldquo;audible-deal&rdquo; shelf is higher this year
and most of the books in the 3-stars row are on this shelf&hellip; Maybe
the deal is not worth the price after all.</p>
<p>Even with the high number of books in the 3-star row I&rsquo;m happy with my
results for 2017 regarding books. <a href="http://amzn.to/2AZWD2q">Mastery</a>
was the shiny pearl of this year, I really like it.</p>
<h3 id="-articles">✅ Articles</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have data for the whole year but I can use the
data I have from March to December.</p>
<p>I could not find a good way to track the articles I read. While I&rsquo;m
still looking for a better way to do that, I&rsquo;m
using <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and manually checking it every
month. It means that every article I read since March was added to
Pocket. Sometimes I read from there but others I just add it there to
count as read.</p>
<p>In March I had <strong>760 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>570 articles Read</strong>. Now,
using the data from my <a href="/post/stats-dec-2017">December stats post</a>, I
have <strong>1296 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>946 articles Read</strong>.</p>
<p>It means that <strong>I read 186 articles this year</strong>, an average of <strong>15
articles each month</strong>. I&rsquo;m aware that I will probably never read all
those 1296 articles left in my Pocket account and I&rsquo;m OK with that.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning that my definition of article read is when I found
some interesting and useful article and read that from bottom to end.</p>
<p>I had no goal for reading articles but I decided to track that to
understand how much I read every year. Before starting with audiobooks
I was really frustrated with the state of my reading stats. I was not
reading many books in the year but I had a feeling that I was reading
many articles, which is not so bad. By tracking that I have the data I
need to prove to myself that I&rsquo;m reading enough, which helps with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor symdrome</a>.</p>
<h3 id="-coding">✅ Coding</h3>
<p>All my coding metrics are provided by <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the total time coding:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png" alt="Total time coding this year" title="Total time coding this year"></a></p>
<p>I confess that I was expecting much more than that. An average of 1h31
per day looks really low for me.</p>
<p>I felt better when checking the comparison with the user base. It
shows that I have almost twice as many hours coding! :)</p>
<p>The low number of hours is probably related to how Wakatime gets the
stats.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png" alt="Total time coding by project this year" title="Total time coding by project this year"></a></p>
<p>This year I did a lot for this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the entire layout</li>
<li>migrated it to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a></li>
<li>converted all posts to Hugo
format</li>
<li>redirected old URLs to the new content,</li>
<li>wrote 19 posts (my goal was 10! 😃)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected to have my blog as the first in the
list of projects for this year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to have my freelance project as the second one
because I almost not work for them in the last 6 months! It says that
I was working for them <strong>a lot</strong> in the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud to have <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> on my list of
projects this year. I&rsquo;m using/following Todoist since 2007 and it&rsquo;s
amazing to have the chance to contribute to the app. 🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png" alt="Total time coding by editor this year" title="Total time coding by editor this year"></a></p>
<p>Looks like I fully switched to Emacs. I&rsquo;m not using Vim as I used
before but sometimes I miss some Vim features. I was talking to a
friend last week about it and I mentioned that if I was still using
querty
(<a href="/experiences-of-almost-two-years-using-colemak/">I use Colemak</a>) I
would probably be still using Vim. Emacs is nice and so is Vim. :)</p>
<p>I was using a plugin to register my terminal usage but I think it
generated more noise than signal. 😞</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png" alt="Total time coding by language this year" title="Total time coding by language this year"></a></p>
<p>Markdown is the first one for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote many posts on my blog</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m responsible for <a href="https://developer.todoist.com">Todoist</a>
and <a href="https://developer.twistapp.com">Twist</a> documentation</li>
<li>I usually write long post in Emacs and then paste them to Twist</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, we have <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Go</strong>, and a little
bit of <strong>Rust</strong>, <strong>Elixir</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong>. I was playing with
game development in Javascript this year and I really bet in Rust and
Elixir, both languages are really great. I don&rsquo;t think I will have
enough ground to play with Elixir this year but maybe Rust will have
his time in my schedule in 2018. 😃</p>
<p><strong>Go</strong> is on my top 5 list but I&rsquo;m not totally comfortable as I would
like to be, hope to improve it in 2018.</p>
<p>Forget about &ldquo;Other&rdquo; it&rsquo;s related to Bash because of my plugin. 🙄</p>
<p>In general, these are great results IMO. 😃</p>
<h3 id="-speaking">✅ Speaking</h3>
<p>I have to say that I&rsquo;m really proud of myself on this one. 😃</p>
<p>Here is the burndown chart I created to follow up each month (nothing fancy, a simple Google spreadsheets):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know yet (because I usually don&rsquo;t post publicly
many things), I was in a &ldquo;competition&rdquo;
with <em><a href="http://milhouseonsoftware.com">Milhouse</a>&rsquo;s last year ghost</em>.</p>
<p>This story is worth sharing since it was part of my goals:</p>
<p><em>In December 2016 I asked Milhouse about how many talks he gave and he</em>
<em>said it was 18 talks. I was stunned. At the time, I was really proud</em>
<em>of my personal record of 12 talks in one year and I know it was really</em>
<em>hard to achieve this number. I asked him to post about it on his blog</em>
<em>and <a href="http://milhouseonsoftware.com/2016/12/29/retro_216/">here it is</a></em>.
<em>When I saw that, I started a competition with</em>
<em>myself, my goal was <strong>to speak in 2017 more than Milhouse did in 2016</strong></em>.</p>
<p>It looks like a time trial race in video games when you have to defeat
your own &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; or the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; of a friend. For those who played bike
racer from <a href="http://www.topfreegames.com/">Top Free Games</a>, it&rsquo;s just
like that.</p>
<p>It may look silly but I always do &ldquo;competitions&rdquo; like that to motivate
myself. Sometimes I use my own data and others I use the data from
someone I admire or someone who did amazing things. This time was
really nice because I told that I was doing it to some friends
(including Milhouse) and it was a cool internal joke between us.</p>
<p>Thanks to that &ldquo;competition&rdquo; I could motivate myself to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propose a talk to <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> and speak outside the
country in a different language. Milhouse had 1 talk outside of
Brazil, so I had to beat that. For this reason, I spoke in Belgium and Portugal.</li>
<li>Speak 3 times in the same conference
(<a href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">TDC</a>) about 3 different
languages (Go, Ruby, Javascript) and 3 different fields (CLI, Web,
Games)</li>
<li>Do 5 talks with live-coding. 3 of them starting from scratch, with a
blank text file and 40 minutes of time (For those who don&rsquo;t know,
one of my biggest fears was live-coding talks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Met a lot of new people, studied many languages, and had <strong>a ton</strong> of
fun. I really recommend this motivation hacking. It&rsquo;s not just for
speaking, you can use it for anything you want.</p>
<h3 id="-completed-tasks">✅ Completed tasks</h3>
<p>In the last years, Todoist is providing a Year in review and this year
is no different. If you&rsquo;re a Todoist user, you can check your
data <a href="https://todoist.com/review/2017/you">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check my Todoist tasks! 🙂</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png" alt="Tasks completed on my Todoist account" title="Tasks completed on my Todoist account"></a></p>
<p>Hm, less than I expected but still OK. I was already expecting for
that but looks like <strong>Monday is the day I complete more tasks</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png" alt="Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account" title="Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account"></a></p>
<p><strong>My most productive time is 16:00</strong> and <strong>what I can&rsquo;t finish at this
time I usually postpone at 19:00</strong> 😬:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png" alt="Tasks completed by time and postponed by time" title="Tasks completed by time and postponed by time"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the top 1% of all Todoist users in 2017! 😃</p>
<p>This <em>Year in Review</em> by Todoist is astonishing! I had the chance to
contribute by helping with the pt-BR translation. 🙂</p>
<h3 id="-podcasts">✅ Podcasts</h3>
<p><strong>587 hours</strong> listening to Podcasts. If I was listening to the
episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn&rsquo;t) it would be equivalent to
more than 23 days of non-stop listening. My app says that I listened
17 days and 7 hours, but I decided to not trust it because I changed
my Podcast application in the beginning of the year and restored a
backup after it, so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s accurate. Instead of using
the value calculated by the app, I calculated month by month based on
my posts.</p>
<p>I consider that one month of extra time since I listen to Podcasts
while commuting, walking the dog, washing the dishes, doing exercises,
etc. It works <strong>really well</strong> for me and sometimes I change between
Podcasts and audiobooks.</p>
<h3 id="-hours-working-focusing-and-distractions">✅ Hours working, focusing and distractions</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review how was my year related to work. This time I have a lot
of metrics to correlate. \o/</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re following my posts or social networks
(<a href="https://twitter.com/PotHix">Twitter</a> is the only one I&rsquo;m using) you
know that I changed jobs in June. I expect that to have a huge impact
on my metrics.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with time working, considering my full-time job only:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time.png" alt="Chart for time working in my full-time job" title="Chart for time working in my full-time job"></a></p>
<p>It increased a lot from July to
December. At <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>, they recommend to not work
more than 8 hours a day and I&rsquo;m clearly not doing that. 😞</p>
<p>Including my freelance job:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time-plus-freelance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time-plus-freelance.png" alt="Chart for time working in my full-time and freelance job" title="Chart for time working in my full-time and freelance job"></a></p>
<p>It looks more even now but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a good thing. I don&rsquo;t
usually work as a freelancer but I work for 1 company for almost two
years now and I really like the challenges they have there, so I would
like to work for them again. To be able to do that, I have to
stabilize my workday.</p>
<p>From July to December I did almost no freelance work for this company:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-freelance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-freelance.png" alt="Chart for time working in my freelance job" title="Chart for time working in my freelance job"></a></p>
<p><strong>A goal for the next year is to work smarter not harder</strong>, so I will have
more time to do other things not related to my full-time job. I really
like my full-time job (more than ever!) but I like to do different
projects without constraints, it can be this freelance job or other
activities that also bring me joy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one metric that makes me feel great. I&rsquo;ve been tracking the
amount of Deep work I do at work since the beginning of the year. I
consider something to be Deep work when I close all external
interruptions (Telegram, Slack, Email, Twist, Cellphone, etc) and
focus on the work I have to do. And for this year I have this:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork.png" alt="Chart for my time Deep working" title="Chart for my time Deep working"></a></p>
<p>What an <strong>AMAZING</strong> thing to see. I really like when I&rsquo;m on the flow
state focusing on my task. That chart shows me that I was happier than
before. 🙂</p>
<p>As I realized that it would not be possible to apply my deep work techniques in my previous job
I was applying that on my freelance work. If I add to the chart all
the freelance work I did for that company (features, bug busting,
infrastructure) we have this:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork-plus-freelance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork-plus-freelance.png" alt="Chart for my time Deep working including my freelance" title="Chart for my time Deep working including my freelance"></a></p>
<p>Which is not that bad. 🙂</p>
<p>The good part is that I can apply Deep work to my full-time job
instead of look for a different place to use it. 🎉</p>
<p>I would love to track the time I spent in meetings comparing the first
semester and the second but I was not tracking it in the first
semester. Now, giving that a second thought, even if I tracked, it
would be more noise than signal. Sometimes you have productive
meetings and other times you have &ldquo;meeting that need to be done&rdquo; where
people keep talking about the unrelated stuff in the first 20 minutes
of the meeting to speak about the productive stuff after
that. So&hellip; <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>.</p>
<p>I also have a metric for the <strong>time I spent doing/planning my talks</strong>
this year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-presentation.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-presentation.png" alt="Chart for my time doing/planning presentations" title="Chart for my time doing/planning presentations"></a></p>
<p>Sometimes I did not track it at all, especially in the beginning of the
year, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning as well. In April and June, I was
practicing for my live-coding session. 🙂</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">rescuetime</a> to
track my productivity. I&rsquo;m not sure if my configuration is good and I
keep changing them, so these metrics may not be so accurate. A good
example of that is my tracking time, I&rsquo;m also tracking the time at
night when I&rsquo;m talking to friends via Telegram or over the weekend.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the productive and distracting hours for the entire
year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-productive-hours.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-productive-hours.png" alt="Rescuetime metrics for productive and distracting hours" title="Rescuetime metrics for productive and distracting hours"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png" alt="Rescuetime metrics for the category that took most of my time" title="Rescuetime metrics for the category that took most of my time"></a></p>
<p>A lot of distracting hours. As it considers my weekends and nights, I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s accurate. It still bothers me that &ldquo;communication &amp;
scheduling&rdquo; is the most used category. I will change that this year.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t talk about music but <a href="https://last.fm">last.fm</a> did a
good &ldquo;year in review&rdquo; for me, so I will add some stats here.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png" alt="Songs scrobbled this year" title="Songs scrobbled this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png" alt="Listening stats for this year" title="Listening stats for this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png" alt="Listening percentiles compared to the user base" title="Listening percentiles compared to the user base"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-discovery.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-discovery.png" alt="Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year" title="Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year"></a></p>
<p>I started using the paid version
of <a href="https://music.google.com">Google Music</a> this year, that explains
why my &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; has an increase of &ldquo;558%&rdquo; this year. I also almost
doubled the number of artists I listened this year.</p>
<p>Some interesting statistics are related to the time I listened to more
songs. It seems that I listen to more songs between 20:00 and
21:00. It&rsquo;s usually when I want to do something different and need
more energy. Wednesday is the day I listen to more music, I have no
idea why it&rsquo;s so different than the rest. 🤔</p>
<p>And the obvious part&hellip; I listen to metal most of the time. 😜</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>I will use my <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> stats to get
some data about it. Here are my data for January and December:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched in January" title="TV shows watched in January"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched in December" title="TV shows watched in December"></a></p>
<p>Based on that (and ignoring how much I watched in January) I can get
to the conclusion that <strong>I watched 241 episodes</strong>, more than 4
episodes a week.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that tvshowtime uses 30 days for one month. In this
case, <strong>I spent 8 days and 5 hours of my year watching TV shows</strong>.</p>
<p>As I don&rsquo;t usually watch TV, I will consider that 1 week and half of
my entire year was spend watching TV. It&rsquo;s 2% of all my time spent
with TV, not sure if it&rsquo;s good enough.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I was expecting to have an easy work on this one since I have some
apps for metrics but turns out that it&rsquo;s not so easy to retrieve
yearly information. 😞</p>
<p>What I did to get the information I need was to look month by month
and take screenshots on my cell phone. I&rsquo;m not including November and
December because December is truncated in the monthly view for some
reason and it would be too much work to include November alone. It was
not so easy or pleasant to get that but here is the data regarding my
steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jan.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jan.jpg" alt="Number of steps from January to May" title="Number of steps from January to May"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jun.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jun.jpg" alt="Number of steps from June to October" title="Number of steps from June to October"></a></p>
<p>Nothing so unusual. It was mostly stable and I had peaks in February
and October, the two months I was traveling to Europe.</p>
<p>Regarding my sleep:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jan.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jan.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep from January to May" title="Amount of sleep from January to May"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jun.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jun.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep from June to October" title="Amount of sleep from January to October"></a></p>
<p>Looks like my deep sleeping (the dark purple) increased in the second
semester. It&rsquo;s interesting because it correlates with the dates I
started in my new job at Doist. In February, when I was not working, I
had a good rate of deep sleeping as well, I will assume it was stress
related to my previous job.</p>
<p>In general, it looks good to me.</p>
<h3 id="-words-written-and-errors">✅ Words written and errors</h3>
<p>After consolidating all the data I collected from Grammarly this year
I have the following:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/grammarly.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/grammarly.png" alt="Grammarly data for this year" title="Grammarly data for this year"></a></p>
<p>I just copied and pasted all the data from all posts into a Google
Spreadsheets and generated a chart, no science here. January,
February and March have no data, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The interesting metric I can get from this chart is that I&rsquo;m writing a
lot more and the <em>corrections made</em> are not increasing at the same
pace. This is really great to see. 😃</p>
<p>Unique words are stable since I started tracking my words. Looks like
my vocabulary is not increasing but I think it&rsquo;s normal, we usually
don&rsquo;t use difficult words in our day-to-day life.</p>
<h3 id="-locations">✅ Locations</h3>
<p>This year was amazing regarding traveling. I went to Belgium,
Netherlands, Scotland, England, Portugal, Spain, and visited many
different cities. I&rsquo;m planning some posts about those cities for a
while now, maybe someday.</p>
<p>In one of those trips I had a goal to speak with people from other
countries and had long conversations with people from Germany, Poland,
Spain, Scotland, Colombia, Canada, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Japan,
Brazil, Uruguay, Australia, Russia, Ireland, Portugal, India, Belgium,
Bosnia, France, Argentina, and Netherlands. It was really great. 😀</p>
<p>Now that you know about the trips, I don&rsquo;t know if I can trust the
data provided by Google Locations. Take your own conclusions:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have my data for January, the first record was
in February (after visiting more than 13 cities in 4 countries):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png" alt="General data for February" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>And this is the data for December:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png" alt="General data for December" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look so different even with all those travels. Considering
that I visited Porto, Lisbon, and Barcelona in October, it doesn&rsquo;t
make any sense. 😞</p>
<p>I use Google maps and Google trips to find new places to go. I&rsquo;m
a <a href="https://maps.google.com/localguides">Google maps local guide</a> and I
usually add reviews to the map. As a side-effect of that, I have stars
in almost all places I go.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-europe.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-europe.png" alt="My Google maps in Europe" title="My Google maps in South America"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-south-america.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-south-america.png" alt="My Google maps in South America" title="My Google maps in South America"></a></p>
<p>I hope to have many other stars soon. :)</p>
<p>According to
<a href="https://matadornetwork.com/travel-map/22396bbf7ad1af6c0d8758cb54077e13-1515270907">matadornetwork</a>,
I visited 8 countries so far:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-world.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-world.png" alt="My world map" title="My world map"></a></p>
<h3 id="-expenses">✅ Expenses</h3>
<p>I would love to do a deep analysis on this topic but unfortunately,
the apps I use do not provide an easy way of doing this. The only
thing I got was this chart for the last 6 months:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/expenses.png" alt="Expenses by category in the last 6 months" title="Expenses by category in the last 6 months"></a></p>
<p>The legend in the left is not so good because I had to remove the
actual values in cash to keep the percentages only. 🙄</p>
<p>Looking into this chart I can see that &ldquo;Viagem&rdquo; (travel) took almost
35% of my expenses. I tend to live a frugal life, so it makes sense to
have my travel expenses taking most part of my money spent. For me,
traveling is an investment and I don&rsquo;t regret spending money on it.</p>
<p>It bothers me that &ldquo;Compras&rdquo; (general spending) is the second category
of my expenses. I was expecting to have &ldquo;Mercado&rdquo; (groceries) here or
maybe &ldquo;Bares / Restaurantes&rdquo; (eating out), but not &ldquo;compras&rdquo;. I will
look closely at it this year because it&rsquo;s an yellow flag for my
expenses.</p>
<p>Regarding my savings, it <strong>increased by 16.83%</strong> this year,
considering the value I had at the end of April (I don&rsquo;t have data for
Jan, Feb, and March). It&rsquo;s an <strong>average of 2.10%</strong> for each month, so
if we apply that for January, February, March, and April, <strong>we would
have 25.25%</strong>. In the end of the year, I had 75.10% of my savings goal.</p>
<p>Considering that I did not receive any payment in the last 6 months,
it&rsquo;s <strong>really great</strong>! I&rsquo;m already expecting for a huge increase in my
savings for January when I received the payment for the work in the
last months. 😃</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Well, this one took some time. 😜</p>
<p>I started it on the airplane, coming back from York. Unfortunately, I
lost my tracking because of a software problem but I doubt I spent
less than 2 hours on it, so let&rsquo;s consider 2 hours.</p>
<p>After that I worked for 07h15min more, so we have <strong>9h15min to write
this blog post</strong> and it worth it, for sure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>What a great year! :)</p>
<p>It is the first time I have that so much metrics to play with. I could
get some interesting information about how was my year and how some
changes influenced my behavior for good or bad.</p>
<p>It took a lot more time than I was expecting but I hope to have an
automated way to do that in the next year.</p>
<p>I achieved almost all of my goals last year, so I don&rsquo;t have anything
to complain. Hope that this year become even better than the last one.</p>

            <description>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel again this month. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.
Books I was traveling this month, so as usual, I&amp;rsquo;m not reading/listening to audiobooks because I prefer to focus on the place I&amp;rsquo;m visiting. For this reason, I did not finish any book this month.
With that said, it is the first time I have 4 books on my reading list at the same time.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel
again this month. Let&rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>I was traveling this month, so as usual, I&rsquo;m not reading/listening to
audiobooks because I prefer to focus on the place I&rsquo;m visiting. For
this reason, I did not finish any book this month.</p>
<p>With that said, it is the first time I have 4 books on my reading list
at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2EibMyt">Elixir in Action</a> is there for some time
now. I really like Elixir and want to finish it as soon as I have the
time. I&rsquo;m also playing with Rust nowadays, so I&rsquo;m
reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2FafTxv">Programming Rust</a> as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2CQn5Bz">The art of invisibility</a> is the current
audiobook and I hope to finish that as soon as I listen to all the
Podcast episodes piled since last
month.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2FcD6PU">Hiding in unnatural happiness</a> is a book I
received from a monk while in York. I&rsquo;m not in a rush with this one
but I want to finish soon, it&rsquo;s really small.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1296
946
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1296 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>946 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1255 unread</strong>
and <strong>931 read</strong>), I got around <strong>1% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>My unread count is not growing so fast anymore and that is a good
thing.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new in this chart this month. The blank parts are related to
the New Year and Christmas holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p><code>markdown</code> is usually the most used language because I write long texts in emacs before posting on <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>.
After that, we have Python and Rust! 😀</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Just removed bash from the reports and now we have Emacs as the only editor being used (it&rsquo;s strange to not have any Vim this month) 🤔</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>No presentations this month. 😀</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>I already reached all my goals for the year and was OK to not speak
during December. I admit that I tried to speak while I was in York
but could not find any local meetup to speak. :P</p>
<p>I had the chance to participate in two meetups
of <a href="https://www.yorkdevelopers.org/">York developers</a> but
unfortunately, there were no slots to speak.</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>This is the number of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>306 tasks</strong> completed this month (<strong>98 less</strong> than last month).</p>
<p>Many holidays and traveling in the last week of the year. I was
totally off and did not check my tasks in these days, this is why I
don&rsquo;t have many tasks done.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>1 day and 3 hours</strong> of podcast time. I decided to not listen to any
podcast while I was in York because I wanted to enjoy every single
moment while walking in the streets. I usually use Podcasts as a way
to escape from my boring routine in my working days but it was not
boring in York. 😀</p>
<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and the full-time job. The
time doing freelance job was 0 hours this month, unfortunately.</p>
<p>We had 18 work days this month and I worked for 157 hours, which mean
that <strong>I worked 13 hours more than I should</strong>. From these 13 hours,
1:23 hours was in a Sunday but it was in the airplane so it doesn&rsquo;t
count :P.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings are stable. I usually have around 4-5 hours of meetings a month. One useful weekly meeting of around 40 min and one 1-1 meeting. If necessary I have small meetings to fix certain problems.</li>
<li>Hiring was <strong>really</strong> hard this month. Many interviews and candidates/test reviews.</li>
<li>Shallow work is still consuming around 60% of my tasks (I&rsquo;m not counting Hiring as shallow work, BTW)</li>
</ul>
<p>This time I have a list of what I was doing with my <em>Shallow
work</em>. Most of the time I can&rsquo;t describe what was it but I know part
of it is my lunch time.</p>
<p>One of the things I can spot as a time consumer here is the
&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo;. As we are committed to meaningful communication, I
tend to read most of the messages that mention me somehow and some of
them are big threads discussing some important problem. It makes sense
to take some time but I would like to improve it. Maybe next month 😉</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, no personal projects this month. 😞
It&rsquo;s kinda sad that I had not personal projects or freelancing this month. I really like to spend some time working on different projects.</p>
<p>I think it happened for a reason: I was in a different city/country
and invested all my time in my full-time job and walking around the
city. I will try to keep that in my mind. 😀</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>As expected, I don&rsquo;t have enough data because I changed my browser
for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox Quantum</a> and forgot
to install the rescuetime extension. Shame on me. 😞</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity-comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/activity_comparison.jpg" alt="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>An average of <strong>10k</strong> steps is good for me. It was better than
November but worse than October, which was expected.</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>17.3km</strong> walking in one day (I was lucky to get
the tooltip to work when taking the screenshot):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>As we can see in the chart, I had more minutes of average sleeping
this month (<strong>7h38m</strong> for the last month) but less deep sleeping (last
month was <strong>1h44</strong>) 😢</p>
<p>Considering the whole user base from mi-band:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" alt="Sleep comparison with the user base" title="Sleep comparison with the user base"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m below average regarding sleeping earlier and on average regarding
deep sleeping.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 1
episode this month:</p>

<p>It was probably <strong>Billions</strong> when I got home. 😀</p>
<p>I spent <strong>1 hour</strong> of my life watching TV shows this month. Not bad 😉.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>93129</strong> words written (<strong>71062</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>1380</strong> corrections made (<strong>1091</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>11979</strong> unique words (<strong>17429</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote a lot this month. Almost 20k words more than last month but I
also made more mistakes, almost in the same proportions. My vocabulary
did not increase in the same rhythm though.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>New cities were added this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png" alt="New cities" title="New cities"></a></p>
<p>The missing city is Durham.</p>
<p>Here are the general data:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird that some countries are disappearing. 😞 Last month
I had 7 countries but now I have 6 again. I
used
<a href="https://matadornetwork.com/travel-map/22396bbf7ad1af6c0d8758cb54077e13-1515270907">Matador network</a> to
track the countries and I visited <strong>8 countries, not 6</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png" alt="Countries map" title="Countries map"></a></p>
<p>Not so useful, but here is the time spent on vehicles:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the time spent in taxis from home to the airport and
also related to the trip we made in North Yorkshire by van.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<p>This trip removed 12k km from my distance to the moon. 👍</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. Yes! You read
that right, I finally received some freaking money after six months! 🎉</p>
<p>This money is still not related to my current job but I already
received my payment, just need to go through the bureaucracy to be
able to pay the taxes and receive that in my personal account.</p>
<p>I will definitely write about this whole process soon.</p>
<p>This month is finally back to normal! My total savings <strong>increased by
1.9%</strong> and now I have <strong>75.10%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<p>Next month will be <strong>huge!</strong></p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 02 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m back to Brazil after one full month working
from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982">York</a>. I have to say that it
was really great to work from a different place for some time.</p>
<p>This was the last month of the year so expect a yearly review from me
soon. 😀</p>

            <description>This will be a quick post to help people that are doing the same search as I was doing some minutes ago: &amp;ldquo;firefox disable ctrl+q&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m using Firefox Quantum for some weeks now (will probably post about it in the future) and the ctrl+q &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; really annoys me.
It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time that I hit ctrl+q by accident just to see the entire browser and tabs being closed without warning.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This will be a quick post to help people that are doing the same
search as I was doing some minutes ago: &ldquo;firefox disable ctrl+q&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox Quantum</a> for
some weeks now (will probably post about it in the future) and the
ctrl+q &ldquo;feature&rdquo; really annoys me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time that I hit ctrl+q by accident just to see the
entire browser and tabs being closed without warning. I was looking on
Google and could not find anything on how to disable it. There were
some extensions but none of them work on Firefox Quantum, so I decided
to dig into the internal configurations.</p>
<p>Looks like there is a configuration called <code>browser.showQuitWarning</code>
that helps with this problem. It does not disable the ctrl+q but shows
a warning and you can just cancel it in case it was an accident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to enable it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type <code>about:config</code> in the address bar</li>
<li>It will say that it&rsquo;s a place for advanced users, so you have to <code>accept the risk!</code></li>
<li>search for <code>browser.showQuitWarning</code></li>
<li>click on it and change it to <code>true</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox Quantum is really better than Chrome nowadays, hope it helps
with the Quit problem.</p>

            <description>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel again this month. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.
Books 
Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft, called At the mountains of madness was one of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read about minimalism just to realize that I&amp;rsquo;m a minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to listen to their podcast and read their website.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel
again this month. Let&rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft,
called <a href="http://amzn.to/2AO5IPW">At the mountains of madness</a> was one
of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read
about <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqZG2h">minimalism</a> just to realize that I&rsquo;m a
minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to
listen to their <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/podcast/">podcast</a> and
read their website.</p>
<p>The last book is <a href="http://amzn.to/2Ath5tX">On power</a> which was probably
the worst book this year. It was so small that I could finish but I
can&rsquo;t say that I learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>I also started
reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2nrzm8p">The Rust Programming language</a>
because I&rsquo;m playing with Rust a little bit. I still want to
finish <a href="http://amzn.to/2ztCDZU">Elixir in Action</a> but it will take a
while.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1255
931
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1255 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>931 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1230 unread</strong>
and <strong>905 read</strong>), I got around <strong>1.7% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>Almost the same growth of the last month. For me, it means that it was
a good thing to check my Feedly once a week but that doesn&rsquo;t change
the number of articles I read and it&rsquo;s probably the new delicious.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>The empty days are related to a holiday in Brazil and a huge amount of technical tickets and support for our APIs during that week. It was the price for the focused work in the week before. :)</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p><code>markdown</code> is usually the most used language because I write long texts in emacs before posting on <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>. I removed the <code>bash</code> plugin from my terminal in the middle of the month so that 38% doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. And then&hellip; <strong>Rust</strong>! It was a fun week.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new here. Emacs at the top, bash being removed and Vim.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desconstruindo a web</strong> at <a href="http://www.codus.com.br/">Codus</a> tech-talks</li>
<li><strong>Desconstruindo a web - Sua app ruby end to end</strong> at <a href="http://www.totvstechday.io/">TOTVS Tech day</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the chart comparing to my goal for this year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>My first goal was to speak 19 times with 1 international talk and I
reached. After reaching the first goal I set a new goal: reach <strong>25
talks this year</strong> and I just met it. Speak 25 times in one year is
more than I could have ever imagined. Now it&rsquo;s time to take a break
and enjoy the last month of the year. :)</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>This is the number of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>404 tasks</strong> completed this month (<strong>17 more</strong> than last month).</p>
<p>This time I have some other colors on the chart. It&rsquo;s related to
internal Todoist projects but most part of it is still personal (red)
and work-related (blue).</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days and 13 hours</strong> of podcast time, just 4 hours more than last month. It means that I spent a lot of time listening to Podcasts again.</p>
<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and the full-time job. Not so much time as a freelancer, though. I decided to do a deep down about the time I spent working for my full-time employee this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-doist.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-doist.png" alt="Hours working for at Doist" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>We had 20 work days in Brazil this month and I worked for 189 hours, which mean that <strong>I worked 30 hours more than I should</strong>. According to this data, almost 5 of those hours were on the weekends/holidays. I should really improve that.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings are stable. I usually have around 4-5 hours of meetings a month. One useful weekly meeting of around 40 min and one 1-1 meeting. If necessary I have small meetings to fix certain problems.</li>
<li>Hiring is taking some time. Interviewing, looking for candidates and writing down my opinions take some time</li>
<li>Shallow work is still consuming around 65% of my tasks. I&rsquo;m trying to describe the tasks better so I can understand what I&rsquo;m considering shallow work. Maybe I will have something next month.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>It is related to my two talks and my participation in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXu-kJE_H4">hangout by Farol Digital</a>. I&rsquo;m still not producing a lot of content but it&rsquo;s an improvement.</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>I changed my browser for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox Quantum</a>
but forgot to install the rescuetime extension, so I don&rsquo;t have enough detailed
data. It will be the same (or worst) for the next month.</p>
<p>Here are the big offenders:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png" alt="Offesors of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Offenders of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>I just changed Twist to <code>productive</code> instead of <code>distracting</code>. I&rsquo;m not
sure if Twist deserves to be distracting because we usually talk about
work there and it&rsquo;s not so distracting. With that said, Twist still
takes a big portion of my time due to the need for communication. It&rsquo;s
the source of all conversations at Doist, but it&rsquo;s up to us to not
make communication overwhelming. I&rsquo;m still working to have the balance
between communication and &ldquo;real work&rdquo;, let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
<strong>6.3k</strong> steps (190625/30). It was kinda disappointing as it&rsquo;s below my
average. I will work on it for the next month. :)</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>8.4km</strong> walking in one day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Some more minutes of average sleeping (<strong>7h31m</strong> for the last month)
but also less deep sleeping (last month was <strong>1h58</strong>) 😢</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 36
episodes this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>This month we finished <strong>Orphan Black (season 4 and 5)</strong> and started <strong>Billions</strong>.</p>
<p>I spent <strong>1 day and 3 hours</strong> of my life watching TV shows this month.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>71062</strong> words written (in September it was <strong>73969</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>1091</strong> corrections made (in September it was <strong>1826</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>17429</strong> unique words (in September it was <strong>17139</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m comparing to September because October was not a typical month. I had fewer words written but I can see that I had fewer corrections made and more unique words! That makes me feel good. 😁</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>At the end of the month, I went to York (the old York, in England, not the New York, in the USA) to work from there for 1 month. So, a new country was added:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-countries.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-countries.png" alt="New countries" title="New countries"></a></p>
<p>I think it was actually part of the list from when I visited London but it&rsquo;s worth posting. The city of York was also added:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-cities.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-cities.png" alt="New cities" title="New cities"></a></p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>One new city and 16 new places.</p>
<p>Not so useful, but here is the time spent on vehicles:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the time spent in the taxi to the airport and in the bus from Manchester to Leeds and York.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<p>This trip removed 11k km from my distance to the moon. 👍</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/nov/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/nov/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described <a href="/post/stats-jul-2017">in</a> <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">the</a> <a href="/post/stats-aug-2017">last</a> <a href="/post/stats-sep-2017">five</a> <a href="/post/stats-oct-2017">months</a> still
persists, for this reason, there&rsquo;s no money coming yet. :(</p>
<p>This month I finally had some good news and the process is almost done, just waiting for the final document. Hope to have something to show next month.</p>
<p>And again&hellip; If you&rsquo;re reading this every month, you already know that
my wife is paying all of our bills until my situation gets back to
normal and I&rsquo;m really glad to have someone to rely on when things like
these happen. ❤</p>
<p>This month is back to normal and my wife helped to keep our expenses
in a good shape. My total savings <strong>increased by 0.6%</strong> and now I have
<strong>73.70%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 30 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Just came back from a trip last month to prepare to travel again this
month. I&rsquo;m writing this post from the winter
of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982">York</a>, it&rsquo;s -1 Celsius but feels
like -7. I worked a lot this month but it enabled me to keep my
work on schedule for the travel so I think it worth it.</p>
<p>I did not receive any money yet but everything is moving forward
now and I hope to have a nice December with everything set up. :)</p>

let&rsquo;s see how it is. 😄</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>I read some pages from <a href="http://amzn.to/2ztCDZU">Elixir in Action</a>, but
unfortunately did not finish any book this month. I usually don&rsquo;t read that
much when traveling, so it&rsquo;s sad but expected. 😞</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>
and the same script to calculate the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1230
905
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1230 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>905 articles Read</strong>. Comparing
with my results from the last month (<strong>1214 unread</strong> and <strong>898 read</strong>), I got around
<strong>1.5% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1% more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>I think it was a good think to not read my Feedly in a daily basis but weekly
instead. I was adding a lot of articles to my Pocket account but was not reading
them so it was wasted time. By checking weekly, I can still catch good articles
without dedicating daily time for it.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>

<p>The empty days are related to the days-off I took to walk around Lisbon,
Barcelona, Madrid, and Toledo. The first half of the month I was working from
the Doist office in Porto and the second half I was working home. It was almost
the same, excluding that Tuesday when I worked more than people usually do in
the office. :P</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>And not it makes sense for me. <code>Bash</code> first and <code>Python</code> right after. :)</p>

<p><code>Emacs</code> before <code>bash</code>, that&rsquo;s nice. It&rsquo;s kinda contradictory with the previous
metric but it&rsquo;s acceptable given that I can run many commands at once. I&rsquo;m not
sure if it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep <code>bash</code> here, maybe I will just remove this
plugin.</p>

</ul>
<p>It was really nice to speak at Porto Python in Portugal. It was kinda funny
because of the Portuguese differences that I don&rsquo;t know, so I probably mixed up
many words. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/rdotpy">Roman Imankulov</a> for inviting
me to speak.</p>
<p>Here is the chart comparing to my goal for this year:</p>

<p>The new (bonus) goal is to reach 25 this year. Not sure if I can do that. :)</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>This is the amount of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>387 tasks</strong> completed this month (<strong>22 more</strong> than last month).</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days and 17 hours</strong> of podcast time, 1 day more than last month. It happened
because I decided to catch up to the unheard episodes when I got home. 😄</p>
<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. As you can see, I
took many days totally off. :)</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>I tried to use Toggl when I was in the office just to compare with my
productivity at home. It was almost the same as if I&rsquo;m working from home, so
kudos to the Porto office. :)</p>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>As expected, just the time related to my talk at Porto Python.</p>
<p>I will not post my data related to <strong>rescuetime</strong> this month because I was
working in the fix for my problem and their team fixed the problem. Rescuetime
stats will be back next month. :)</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of <strong>11.6k</strong>
steps (359/31). I think <code>mean</code> is not a good aggregation function for this data
because when I was traveling I had days like this:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/walking-toledo.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/walking-toledo.jpg" alt="Walking around Toledo" title="Walking around Toledo"></a></p>
<p>Well&hellip; I really like to walk when I&rsquo;m traveling. :)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my Google fit is missing some data, so I will not post all charts
as usual.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Almost the same as the last month but 10 minutes more for <strong>avg sleep</strong> and
<strong>avg deep sleep</strong>. There are some comparisons with their database:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" alt="Deep sleep comparison" title="Deep sleep comparison"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so bad after all. :)</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 15 episodes this
month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>When I got back, we decided to watch <strong>Stranger Things (season 2)</strong> and get back
to <strong>Orphan Black (season 3)</strong>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still difficult to calculate how much time I spent watching TV this month
(because I could not track last month in a good way) but I think I watched 17
hours of TV. I used <a href="http://tii.me">tii.me</a> to calculate the second season of
stranger things and calculated 40 min for each of the 5 episodes of Orphan
black.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>My stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>49657</strong> words written (last month was <strong>73969</strong>), <strong>26487</strong> of them written
in the last week of October</li>
<li><strong>1212</strong> corrections made (last month was <strong>1826</strong>), <strong>772</strong> of them made in
the last week of October</li>
<li><strong>12725</strong> unique words (last month was <strong>17139</strong>), <strong>5806</strong> of them written in
the last week of October</li>
</ul>
<p>This month is really atypical and should not be compared with the previous month
but it has its own interesting facts. The last week of October was really
interesting. I had a lot of material to compile and write down for my team. For
this reason there is a lot of words written.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>This section is really nice! 😁
As I said, I visited two new countries:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-countries.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-countries.png" alt="New countries" title="New countries"></a></p>
<p>And 5 new cities:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-cities.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-cities.png" alt="New cities" title="New cities"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the email sent by Google timeline was not so descriptive this
time. But the other 2 cities are <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GWf9vcDakNB2">Toledo</a>
and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/THiztuMChqs">Lisbon</a>.</p>
<p>So, in summary:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>It was almost 100 new places visited 😱.</p>
<p>Here is the time spend in vehicles:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>I was expecting more time than that, but it looks accurate in case it&rsquo;s not
considering airplanes. I took a train from Lisbon to Porto (3.5 hours) and a
train from Madrid to Toledo and back (1.5h maybe).</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<p>Hope to reach the moon some day.</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/oct/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/oct/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described in
<a href="/post/stats-jul-2017">the</a> <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">last</a> <a href="/post/stats-aug-2017">four</a> <a href="/post/stats-sep-2017">months</a> still
persists, for this reason, there&rsquo;s no money coming yet. :(</p>
<p>Part of the problem seems to be solved and now I&rsquo;m back to the normal
process. Hope to have everything set up this month.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this every month, you already know that my wife is paying all
of our bills until my situation gets back to normal and I&rsquo;m really glad to have
someone to rely on when things like these happen. ❤</p>
<p>I traveled to Europe last month and part of the expenses were paid by me to
receive the reimbursement for it later. As I&rsquo;m not able to receive my payment
for some time now, it caused a negative impact in my savings.</p>
<p>My total savings <strong>decreased by 1.31%</strong>, which means that I have <strong>73.26%</strong> of my
goal. 😢</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took 4 hours and 10 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It was a great month. I forgot about the whole problem of not being able to
receive any money and took the whole month to meet new people and places. 😄</p>
<p>It was really nice to meet 12 people (from 8 different countries) of the team in
person and also represent the company at <a href="https://hackupc.com/">hackUPC</a>.</p>
<p>During this trip I decided to say in hostels most of the time to talk to people
from different cultures (and also because I had to pay for it&hellip; 😄). I talked
to people from Germany, Poland, Spain, Scotland, Colombia, Canada, Lithuania,
Czech Republic, Japan, Brazil, Uruguay, Australia, Russia, Ireland, Portugal,
India, Belgium, Bosnia, France, Argentina, and Netherlands. It was not just a
&ldquo;Hi, where are you from?&rdquo;, most of them were 30min+ conversations and some of
them took more then 2 hours.</p>
<p>I also bought a sword (a replica of Andúril), but that&rsquo;s a story for a different
post. :D</p>
<p>So&hellip;mission accomplished for this month. o/</p>

            <description>It&amp;rsquo;s already the end of October and I could not manage to post my stats from September but I have a good reason for that (which you will read about in the next month 😉).
Books 
What Doesn’t Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength is a book that describes what the human body can do if trained for it. The writing process is not so good for my taste, sometimes it looks like a memoir, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s non-fiction&amp;hellip; but the message it passes is really interesting.</description>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2kusAgC">What Doesn’t Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength</a> is
a book that describes what the human body can do if trained for it. The writing
process is not so good for my taste, sometimes it looks like a memoir, sometimes
it&rsquo;s non-fiction&hellip; but the message it passes is really interesting. The
evolution did a lot of work for us but we&rsquo;re kind of using technology to do some
stuff for us and losing part of what we developed. I recommend it, BTW.</p>
<p>It was <strong>really</strong> less books read then last month, but it&rsquo;s ok. I had a lot of
pressing things to do this month.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1214
898
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1214 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>898 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (1157 unread and
883 read), I got around <strong>5% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>2%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>I did not take so much time for articles reading this month, so the numbers
increased less than they use to. It was also affected by the time it took to
generate the numbers last month.</p>
<p>Another correlation with this one may be related to the fact that I&rsquo;m
only reading my Feedly once a week instead of every day, that helps a
lot to not add many articles to Pocket. :)</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>

<p>As usual, it&rsquo;s kind of the average with one outlier. This average of 3-4 hours
coding always bugs me.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why <code>markdown</code> always takes the lead (after <code>bash</code>), but <code>Python</code> is coming as it should.</p>

<p><strong>1 day and 16 hours</strong> of podcast time, almost 1 day more than last month. As I
said in the previous month, when I listen to less audiobooks I usually have more
time spent on podcasts. 😄</p>
<p>I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/sep/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/sep/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>

<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost

<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. Currently it&rsquo;s just
my full-time job, because there are some stuff preventing me to work on my
freelance.</p>
<p>Here is the difference between shallow and deep work regarding my full-time job:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>It was less deep work than last month (10 hours less) but it&rsquo;s good to know I&rsquo;m
still spending around 1/3 of my time in Deep Work state. I&rsquo;m also tracking time
in meetings and it was half of the time spend last month. 😁</p>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>A little bit more personal projects but they are all related to my
presentations. :)</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had a problem with Rescue time this month (and probably next
month too, we&rsquo;re debugging it) and my data is not being collected properly. 😢</p>
<p>But there is not just bad news for this case! I now have a partnership with
rescuetime and have access to a premium account. Thanks rescuetime team! 😁</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>

<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of <strong>8.6k</strong>
steps (258/30). It was almost 50k more steps than last month, which is really good.</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>

<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/sep/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/sep/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Less average sleeping (<strong>7h49m</strong> for the last month) and also less deep
sleeping for this month (last month was <strong>1h48</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 50 episodes this
month! It&rsquo;s a personal record but I&rsquo;m not sure if this is good or bad.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/sep/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/sep/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of <strong>The defenders</strong>, <strong>Marvel agents of shield (season 4)</strong>
and <strong>Orphan Black (seasons 1-3)</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I got the results too late and I can&rsquo;t calculate how many hours I
spent watching TV this month. 😢</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>My stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>73969</strong> words written (<strong>69493</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>1826</strong> corrections made (<strong>1881</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>17139</strong> unique words (<strong>13925</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers keep rising because all of my work conversations are in English and
that&rsquo;s nice. I had <strong>more than 6% more words written</strong> , around <strong>19% more
unique words</strong> and <strong>3% less corrections made</strong> (!!).</p>
<p>It was great to see less corrections made this month, it seems I&rsquo;m improving! 😄</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>For some reason, there is 1 city less than next month. I really don&rsquo;t know how
Google calculates that. 😞 But visited 11 places this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/sep/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/sep/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>Here is the time spend in vehicles:</p>

<p>Just 10 hours spent in transport, that&rsquo;s great. :)</p>

<p>Hope to reach the moon some day.</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/sep/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/sep/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. The number is not wrong,
I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described in
the
<a href="/post/stats-jul-2017">last</a> <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">three</a> <a href="/post/stats-aug-2017">months</a> still
persists, for this reason, there&rsquo;s no money coming yet. :(</p>
<p>So&hellip; the situation is the same&hellip; My wife is paying all of our bills until my
situation gets back to normal. I&rsquo;m stressed with this situation but it&rsquo;s great
to have someone to rely on when things like these happen. ❤️</p>
<p>Unfortunately I did not checked all my finances in the beginning of the month,
so I can&rsquo;t tell how it was. I will keep the same value as the last month, so I
still reached <strong>74.23%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 16 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<p>I wrote part of it during an airplane travel so its approximate.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Again&hellip; excluding the fact of not being able to receive my payment because of
bureaucracy that has nothing to do with what I do, this month was good. I had to
rush to get everything setup for my travel in the next month but it was cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already aware that the next month will be really different because I will
take 1 week off and will work from different locations. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>

            <description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m working on something I really believe is good at Doist and I feel great.
As I mentioned on this post (in pt-BR) I left the company I was working for the last year to join a new company. The new company is Doist and I&amp;rsquo;m working for them since July.
Some time ago a friend asked me why I joined Doist and I realized it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a love story so I decided to write the post.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I&rsquo;m working on something I really believe is good
at <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a> and I feel great.</p>
<p>As I mentioned on <a href="/post/7-anos-de-locaweb-e-a-saida/">this post</a> (in pt-BR) I
left the company I was working for the last year to join a new company. The new
company is <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a> and I&rsquo;m working for them since July.</p>
<p>Some time ago a friend asked me why I joined Doist and I realized it&rsquo;s kind of a
love story so I decided to write the post. 😄</p>
<p>For those who are not aware of Doist, it&rsquo;s the company
behind <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>
and <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>. Twist is a communication tool that
aims to make remote communication work better for remote teams and
Todoist is the best task manager I know.</p>
<p>I joined the company in July as I said
but
<a href="https://br.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/gtdbr/conversations/messages/4354">I&rsquo;m a Todoist user since 2007</a> (this
link requires yahoo groups membership, it&rsquo;s free but required) and I always
recommended my friends to use it. I tried many task managers in these 10 years
but I always get back to Todoist.</p>
<p>When I started my career as a software engineer in 2006, I decided to also look
for a better way to deal with my tasks. My memory is not very good, so I decided
to look for a system to help me with that and found GTD. For some time I was one
of the moderators of gtd-br, probably the biggest GTD mail list in Brazil at the
time and was looking for an application to manage my tasks.</p>
<p>I was looking for something clean, lightweight, simple, and with support to
keyboard shortcuts. Tried Toodledo, Remember the milk, thinking rock, and some
others but none of them were good enough. I was about to create my own when I
found Todoist, it was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>As an active user, I was always following the new features and the usage of new
technologies in the product. I remember when they started using HTML5 for their
mobile application, it was really great to see it.</p>
<p>At some point I found that a company called Doist appeared as the creator of
Todoist (it was just Todoist before that) and I started looking to their job
board. There were not so many positions and all of them required a good level of
Python. My focus was always Ruby and I didn&rsquo;t have any experience with large
Python projects at the time.</p>
<p>Some years passed and I had the chance to work on some Python projects at work
and gained some experience. I even created a personal project in Python to do
some scrapping for some financial data I wanted, it became a big project but it
was abandoned after Google Finance implemented my main feature. :P</p>
<p>When the time for a change came I decided to apply for companies I admire and
who believe in the same things I do. I also changed my mindset and decided to
not look for technology anymore but for products I believe are really good and
can recommend to my friends and family.</p>
<p>I worked for 5 companies in the past and none of their products were something I
can really recommend to everyone. Most of them don&rsquo;t even exist anymore. Others
are relatively good in one specific use case and country. I was working for
these companies because there were great people, good salary/benefits, or great
technology.</p>
<p>When I saw the position to &ldquo;API &amp; Integrations&rdquo; developer at Doist I decided to
apply. I was kind of insecure about the platform change (Ruby -&gt; Python) but I
believe languages are just tools to build stuff and I had enough experience to
be proficient with Python. I also love to create tools for developers and did
that in the past many times already, so it would be a great fit.</p>
<p>During the interviewing process I found that it was a <strong>perfect</strong> match of beliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote working</li>
<li>Async working (not fixed hours, we believe you will do you job and will follow
your metrics)</li>
<li>Chance to travel and meet different people/cultures</li>
<li>We read nice books and actually apply their concepts (radical candor, the
score takes care of itself, let my people go surfing)</li>
<li>Bootstrapped company</li>
<li>Amazing perks for remote working</li>
<li>Almost the same salary I had</li>
</ul>
<p>I was already doing remote work 70% of the time for my previous company and I
also have a freelance job for a company in Netherlands, so I&rsquo;m used to remote
working already. With that said, I took the job. :)</p>
<p>Of course not everything is rainbows and unicorns, as everything in life, but
the overall experience is really great. At this moment, I&rsquo;m writing this blog
post in the airplane (airplanes are the bad part :P), coming back from a trip
where I met 12 members of the team (we&rsquo;re 50+ at the moment) in two different
countries. I also was the person of contact for all hackers doing our challenge
at the HackUPC hackathon in Barcelona, which helped me a lot to collect feedback
of our APIs.</p>
<p>The whole thing about the &ldquo;love story&rdquo; I mentioned in the beginning of this
post is that Todoist helps me since the beginning of my career and now, after
almost 10 years, I have the change to work for the company behind it. What is
even greater is that the company has the same mindset and beliefs I have.</p>
<p>For this particular case, instead of using technology to retain talent, Doist
built the best product ever, which made me consider applying to make it even
better.</p>

            <description>September is here, time to review my stats for August, 2017.
Books 
This is my personal record of books read in one single month. 7 freaking books. 😱
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with two small books I read. Cesar Millan&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Audiobooks for Dogs and Cesar Millan&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog. These two books were free on Audible for Dogs, so I decided to give them a try.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>September is here, time to review my stats for August, 2017.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>This is my personal record of books read in one single month. 7 freaking
books. 😱</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with two small books I
read. <a href="http://amzn.to/2iOU0wT">Cesar Millan&rsquo;s Guide to Audiobooks for Dogs</a>
and
<a href="http://amzn.to/2wYH8ub">Cesar Millan&rsquo;s Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog</a>. These
two books were free on <a href="https://audible.com/dogs">Audible for Dogs</a>, so I
decided to give them a try. They are ordinary books but I would recommend for
dog lovers. :)</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2wqE094">Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity</a> is
one of the best books I read on leadership. There&rsquo;s no magic here, just deal
with people in the right way. Give sincere feedback, expect sincere feedback,
understand their career paths and let them go if the job is not good for them
(and vice-versa). I recommend every boss to read it. Seriously.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2wZ13sQ">Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box</a>
is a book that helps you to think about your attitude before judging people. Not
amazing, but it&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2105449169">The Destroyer of Worlds</a> was
a recommendation from <a href="https://twitter.com/amix3k">Amir</a> and until now none of
his recommendations disappointed, so I decided to try it. The content is really
amazing! A lot of context about the political and moral problems of the atomic
bombs. I really recommend to listen to it if you like the subject. The
descriptions of the Japanese of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are really hard to listen
though. It&rsquo;s not a book, but you will consider that as a book as soon as you
listen to it.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2eqFrus">My Favorite Universe</a> is a great book to introduce
people to science. Neil deGrasse Tyson has the ability to show complicated stuff
in an uncomplicated way. The example of density with the cream on his hot
chocolate is really nice.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2wqJhx8">Rendezvous with Rama</a> is one of those books I was not
expecting to like but turns out to be one of the best books I read in the
genre. The way Arthur C. Clarke describes Rama and how everything works there is
really amazing. Totally recommended.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1157
883
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1157 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>883 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (1044 unread and
777 read), I got around <strong>10% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>12%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>It increased the percentages of read and unread because it took some time to
generate the numbers. Anyways, the problem persists, I usually don&rsquo;t read the
articles I mark to read. Looks like Pocket is my new app for bookmarks&hellip; Yay! :(</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using it to mark all the articles I read throughout the month, so it&rsquo;s not
that useless but I will have to reconsider the idea of reading all articles I
have there. Maybe start producing instead of consuming, which is one trend I&rsquo;ve
been seeing a lot nowadays.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>As usual, it&rsquo;s kind of the average with one outlier. This average of 3-4 hours
coding always bugs me.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why <code>markdown</code> always takes the lead (after <code>bash</code>), but <code>Python</code> is coming as it should.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new to editors. I still use Vim, but Emacs is the leader by far.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/136449291@N08/36751193061/in/album-72157684637490782/">Desconstruindo a web: Entendendo uma requisição</a> at <a href="https://interdevops.com.br">Interdevops</a></li>
<li><strong>Uma requisição web do começo ao fim</strong> at <strong>Tech-hour Catho</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was an ordinary month regarding presentations, but still following what I
had defined for my goal:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>The goal was reached this month! I will try to keep the same rhythm and maybe
speak in different countries. :)</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>This is the amount of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>534 tasks</strong> completed this month (<strong>20 less</strong> than last month).</p>
<p>I still have plans to create a better way to extract data from my Todoist
account, just need some spare time. Not so easy these days.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>1 day and 16 hours</strong> of podcast time, almost 1 day less than last month. This
is a trend I&rsquo;ve been following, when I read (or listen to) more books I consume
less podcasts. :)</p>
<p>I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. It&rsquo;s really hard to
work as a freelancer now, my full-time job is taking all my energy, so most part
of it is dedicated to it.</p>
<p>Here is the difference between shallow and deep work regarding my full-time job:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>It was less deep work than last month (13 hours less) but it&rsquo;s good to know I&rsquo;m
still spending around 1/3 of my time in Deep Work state. I&rsquo;m also tracking time
in meetings, it was almost one day in meetings this month. I did not track every
single meeting because it would be too much work, but it was basically related
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-1 meeting</li>
<li>Weekly status (30 min each)</li>
<li>Meeting with other members of the team</li>
<li>Useful meetings with other teams and thirty parties</li>
</ul>
<p>I hate useless meetings but all of these were useful and needed. :)</p>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>Even less than last month, it makes me sad :(.</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad but I missed my goal for this month. Looks like it was pretty close (99%):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-detail.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-detail.png" alt="Details of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Details of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>BTW, my goal is 3h using only productive apps, the idea is to improve the usage
of these. Here are the big offensors:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png" alt="Offesors of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Offensors of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>Yeah, communication and Scheduling. I really want to spend less time
in <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>. It&rsquo;s the source of all conversations at Doist,
but it&rsquo;s up to us to not make communication overwhelming. I&rsquo;m still working to
have the balance between comunication and real work. Time to improve this. :)</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of <strong>6.6k</strong>
steps (207/31). It was almost 50k less steps than last month. I was not feeling
good some days so I had to skip the gym, maybe this is the cause of that.</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>9.2km</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>My weight is stable:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>And here is some data on my current weight:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight-data.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight-data.jpg" alt="Data on my weight for this month" title="Data on my weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>MiFit app interface for sleep data changed a little bit but here is my data for
this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>A bit more average sleeping (<strong>7h32m</strong> for the last month) and more deep
sleeping for this month \o/ (last month was <strong>1h32</strong>). It&rsquo;s probably not related
(at least not in particular) to the change of bands (Mi band -&gt; Mi band 2),
because I&rsquo;m using it for two months now and my deep sleeping improved for the
second month.</p>
<p>Here is my stats comparing to the whole Mi band user base:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep_stats.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep_stats.jpg" alt="Stats about my sleep data" title="Stats about my sleep data"></a></p>
<p>Not so good, I think. 😅</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 24 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of <strong>Westworld</strong> (recommended, BTW), <strong>The defenders</strong>, <strong>The
crown</strong>, and <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that I had some delay to get this screenshot and there are some numbers from
September already (blue arrow). With that said, I think I spent around <strong>24
hours</strong> watching TV this month.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>My stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>69493</strong> words written (<strong>51018</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>1881</strong> corrections made (<strong>1272</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>13925</strong> unique words (<strong>10332</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers keep rising because all of my work conversations are in English,
that&rsquo;s nice. I had <strong>more than 20% more words written</strong> , around <strong>30% more unique
words</strong>, but also <strong>more than 34% more corrections made</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>This time I have one additional city in the list because I traveled to bebedouro
to speak at <a href="https://interdevops.com.br">interdevops</a>. It also helped to
increase the list of places visited by <strong>9</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>Here is the time spend in vehicles:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>I know I spent 9 hours traveling to speak at interdevops and 3 hours to speak at Catho, so 12 from these 14 hours are related to my presentations. Pretty good. Just want to say it again: <strong>Remote work FTW</strong>!</p>
<p>And as always, the funny metric:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<p>Hope to reach the moon some day.</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/aug/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/aug/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this month</strong>. The number is not wrong,
I did not receive any money this
month. <a href="/post/stats-jul-2017">The problem I described last month</a> and
the <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">month before it</a> is not solved yet, for this reason,
there&rsquo;s no money coming yet. :(</p>
<p>My expenses are normal again but I&rsquo;m not paying anything, my wife is paying all
of our bills until my situation gets back to normal. I&rsquo;m kinda stressed with
this situation but it&rsquo;s great to have someone to rely on when things like these
happen. ❤️</p>
<p>Well, thanks to the volatile economy in Brazil, my total savings increased by
<strong>1.9%</strong> and I did not add any money to it (because I&rsquo;m not receiving
anything&hellip;). Now I reached <strong>74.23%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 52 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<p>1 hour more than last month, I need to improve it for next month.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Excluding the fact of not being able to receive my payment because of
bureaucracy that has nothing to do with what I do, this month was good. I&rsquo;m
integrated to the team and getting used to the code and the team way of work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice to work on products you love and also see people using it and
giving nice feedback. I was missing that for a long time. :)</p>
<p>The next step is try to improve my productivity for the next month. Let&rsquo;s see
how it goes.</p>

            <description>Okay, here we go for the first full month working in my new job. :)
Books 
This month I read Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman, which was recommended by the other Doisters. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book by the guy who built the company Patagonia, a bootstrapped company, from scratch. Their way of thinking looks a lot like the way we think at Doist.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, here we go for the first full month working in my new job. :)</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>This month I read
<a href="http://amzn.to/2hrZ7Cu">Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman</a>,
which was recommended by the other <a href="https://doist.com">Doisters</a>. It&rsquo;s a great
book by the guy who built the company <a href="www.patagonia.com">Patagonia</a>, a
bootstrapped company, from scratch. Their way of thinking looks a lot like the
way we think at Doist.</p>
<p>The second one is
<a href="http://amzn.to/2v2fElh">Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better</a>. I
bought this book on Audible daily deal and it surprised me in a good way. It was
made for teachers in the beginning but was changed for the general public. You
can still feel the education background but it is not a bad thing for me. I
found some good strategies my teachers used on me when I was on college.</p>
<p>The 7th season of Game of Thrones just started and I decided to
read
<a href="http://amzn.to/2v1YcgJ">A Game of Thrones, the fist book of A Song of Ice and Fire</a>. After
reading it I found the 1st season to be really loyal to the books, which is
really nice. If you, like me, enjoys the TV show a lot, I really recommend
reading. There are some background and feelings you understand better when
reading the books. I hope to start the next one soon.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1044
777
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1044 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>777 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (968 unread and
708 read), I got around <strong>8% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>9%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>It improved a little bit compared to last month but the unread count is still
growing which means I will probably never read many of those articles. =/</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new here. I have one big peak of almost 7 hours of coding but the rest
is stable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still fixing some docs and get all the projects up and running, so I still
have a lot of <code>bash</code> and some <code>markdown</code>, but <code>Python</code> is growing.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Editors are pretty much the same as last month&rsquo;s.</p>

</ul>
<p>Six presentations in one month. Three of them were in the same day. This month
is a personal record for me. 🎉</p>
<p>It was also a huge step towards my goal:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>Hm&hellip; I kinda finished the yearly challenge in July. 😬</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how far I can go! :D</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>I want to add the amount of tasks completed on <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>554 tasks</strong> completed this month. :D</p>
<p>I also included my streaks but I think I will have to improve my daily goals,
they are too small for me.</p>
<p>I have plans to create a better way to extract data from my Todoist account, but
I will need some time to work on it.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days and 18 hours</strong> of podcast time, that&rsquo;s a lot. :)</p>
<p>I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just for the record, this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<p><a href="http://castalio.info/">Castalio Podcast</a> is going up every month. I was a guest <a href="http://castalio.info/episodio-110-willian-molinari-desconstruindo-a-web.html">on their podcast</a>, btw! :D</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. My full-time job is
taking all my energy currently and there is not so much time spent working as a
freelancer this month. The good part is that I&rsquo;m working a lot less
than <a href="/post/stats-may-2017/#working-hours">the previous months</a> but I&rsquo;m
exhausted in the same way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed the way I&rsquo;m tracking my projects and now I can see the difference
between Deep Work and Shallow work in a better way:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see that I&rsquo;m spending 1/3 of my time in Deep Work state. :)</p>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>It was really hard to work on personal projects this month. This 11 hours was my
presentations. I did not consider the whole day speaking at TDC though. :)</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>Another month reaching my productivity goal! :D</p>
<p><strong>The only month I reached my goal before joining Doist was March</strong>, the month
right after my vacations, and now it&rsquo;s the second month in a row. Hope to keep
it.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
<strong>8k</strong> steps (249/31), it came back to my previous average.</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>8.3km</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Some more weight but not so much:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>MiFit app interface for sleep data changed a little bit but here is my data for
this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>A bit more average sleeping (<strong>7h29m</strong> for the last month) and <strong>a lot</strong> more
deep sleeping for this month \o/ (last month was <strong>1h04</strong>).</p>
<p>I bought the Mi band 2, it may have some better monitoring. Let&rsquo;s see how it
goes for the next month. :)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new feature comparing my stats to the user base:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep_stats.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep_stats.jpg" alt="Stats about my sleep data" title="Stats about my sleep data"></a></p>
<p>I liked it. :)</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 24 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of the two seasons of <strong>Mr. Robot</strong> (really recommended for
programmers, BTW), <strong>American Gods</strong>, and <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>.</p>
<p>I spent <strong>20 hours</strong> watching TV this month.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>51018</strong> words written (<strong>34156</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>1272</strong> corrections made (<strong>634</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>10485</strong> unique words (<strong>10332</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all my work conversations are in English, I have a lot more data here.
Less unique words than last month (🤔) but almost 1/3 more words. The bad part
is the corrections made, <strong>2x more</strong> than last month. =/</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Again, for some reason 1 city is gone from my timeline, that&rsquo;s weird. In the
other hand, the amount of places I visited increased by <strong>14</strong>. I&rsquo;m not sure if
I can trust on this data from Google Maps.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>I also decided to add the amount of time spent in a vehicle this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>My presentations increased the time spent on transport, I think. I don&rsquo;t know if
I can trust on the distance walking.</p>
<p>But still, 16 hours in transport for the whole month! <strong>Remote work FTW</strong>!</p>
<p>Here is a funny metric:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<p>The time I have to walk to &ldquo;get to the moon&rdquo;, LOL.</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jul/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jul/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents all my income for this
month</strong>. <a href="/post/stats-jun-2017/">As predicted last month</a>, I did not receive
anything because I was still waiting for the whole process to get my company
ready to generate invoices. It took almost two months to complete but I think
it&rsquo;s done and I can finally generate new invoices to receive my payment.</p>
<p>Most part of my expenses goes to &ldquo;Despesas do trabalho&rdquo; (work expenses), since I
had to pay a lot of taxes to get my own company ready.</p>
<p>It was amazing to find that I still increased my total savings by <strong>0.5%</strong> (not
so much compared to <strong>5.2%</strong> of the last month, but it&rsquo;s positive!) and reached
<strong>72.83%</strong> of my goal. It happened thanks to my wife supporting our expenses. ❤️</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours to write this post</strong></p>
<p>1 hour less than last month but I will still work to improve this time.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>My new job is taking a lot of my energies. There is a lot of work to do and new
stuff to learn. I&rsquo;m doing my best to make the software I love since 2007 become
a great platform to developers build their stuff on top of it.</p>
<p>I was not expecting to be so tired at the end of the day, I had to put some
personal projects aside for some months.</p>
<p>Aside of that, the company and my co-workers are great, I&rsquo;m really enjoying the
experience of building a great product.</p>

            <title>My Archlinux setup</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/archlinux/</link>

            <description>I was playing with Archlinux in the last 3 or 4 years and last year I decided to reboot my configuration files and start using Xfce.
Talking to Fabio Akita about my Archlinux tunning, I heard that I should be posting about that. That&amp;rsquo;s true, so I decided to start writing it. I wrote in March and it was in draft form since then, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to release it. :)</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was playing with Archlinux in the last 3 or 4 years and last year I decided to

<p>Talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/AkitaOnRails">Fabio Akita</a> about my Archlinux
tunning, I heard that I should be posting about that. That&rsquo;s true, so I decided
to start writing it. I wrote in March and it was in draft form since then, so it&rsquo;s time
to release it. :)</p>
<p>BTW, Fabio
<a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2017/01/10/arch-linux-best-distro-ever">already did that</a>,
but I will post about my setup anyway.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-environment">Desktop Environment</h3>
<p>I was using Gnome before deciding to reboot my workstation. I
met <a href="https://twitter.com/marcosnils">@marcosnils</a> at Gophercon last year and we
had some chatting about window managers. I&rsquo;m a big fan of tiling and was
planning to go to a tiling window manager again. The problem with tiling window
managers is the amount of configuration you have to create in order to have your
laptop in a fully functional mode. I was looking for something between a window
manager and a desktop environment, something composable with some support for
tiling. And then, he shows me his laptop with Xfce running.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t look like the Xfce I know. It was pretty smooth and with many
features I did not know. Then, I decided to give Xfce a try.</p>
<p>At first, it was horrible but functional. I could compose its packages to only
install what I wanted and almost everything was working out of the box. That&rsquo;s
what I was looking for. So it&rsquo;s time for themes, fonts, bars and so on, just to
make it beautiful.</p>
<p>Here is my results:</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/archlinux-setup/archlinux_setup_xfce.png" title=""><img src="/images/posts/archlinux-setup/archlinux_setup_xfce.png" alt="Xfce screenshot" title="Xfce screenshot"></a></p>
<p>It looks good to me. :)</p>
<p>Xfce has shortcuts to do what I like to do with tiling: vertical and horizontal
splits. Here is an example of me writing this blog post on a split screen on my
ultrawide monitor:</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/archlinux-setup/xfce_split.png" title=""><img src="/images/posts/archlinux-setup/xfce_split.png" alt="Xfce tiling example" title="Xfce tiling example"></a></p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts for different types of screenshots were really useful as
well. I did not know this feature, but it was probably my fault. :P</p>
<h3 id="window-manager">Window manager</h3>
<p>I was trying different window managers at the time, so I decided to
give <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> a try. It looks very good if you like (or have the
time) to configure and tune it.</p>
<p>As I was trying different things, why not to try Wayland as well? So I
installed <a href="http://swaywm.org/">sway</a> instead of i3 to use it with Wayland. It
was an interesting test. My configuration files work with i3 and sway currently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually using Xfce but sometimes I log in with sway to take advantage of the
tiling in a different way.</p>
<h3 id="managing-configuration-files">Managing configuration files</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to use configuration managers for this task (like
<a href="https://saltstack.com/">Salt</a>,
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>,
<a href="https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html">Chef solo</a> and so on) but I preferred to
use a simpler way.</p>
<p>All configurations to recreate this environment is available in
my <a href="https://github.com/PotHix/pothix-dotfiles">dotfiles repository</a>. It uses a
project called <a href="https://github.com/dgvncsz0f/dot-install">dot-install</a> created
by <a href="https://github.com/dgvncsz0f">Diego Souza</a>. It is a simple bash script that
copies the files to the correct places, BOOM, done. I like it.</p>
<p>I can create bundles to apply the same configuration files to more than one
computer. Some files have to change because of network interface names and so
on, but the structure is the same.</p>
<h3 id="kernel">Kernel</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying different kernels. The first one (and easier)
was <a href="https://github.com/zen-kernel/zen-kernel/issues/30">linux-zen</a>. It is
available in the community repository of Archlinux. I really recommend it in
case you don&rsquo;t need (or want) to use Docker with support to <code>overlayfs</code>.</p>
<p>I was also compiling the <code>rc</code> releases of the Linux kernel whenever possible, so
I could try to contribute in case I found something weird, but as it takes a lot
of my time, I decided to give it a break for some time.</p>
<p>But the best one until now is
the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/linux-ck">linux-ck</a>. It is the Linux
kernel with the patches
from <a href="http://users.on.net/~ckolivas/kernel/">Con Kolivas</a>. There is a different
scheduler running and some other improvements. It was made with desktop
performance in mind (just like <code>linux-zen</code>, that uses the same scheduler from
<code>linux-ck</code>).</p>
<p><code>linux-ck</code> has its own repo, in case you don&rsquo;t want to compile it yourself from
AUR. Just add this line to your pacman.conf:</p>
<pre><code>[repo-ck]
Server = http://repo-ck.com/$arch
</code></pre>
<p>Just be aware that the link quality is awful. You have to retry it many times to
get the file downloaded. =/</p>
<h3 id="tunning">Tunning</h3>
<p>There are some good tips to apply on your Archlinux, but I will not just copy
&amp; paste it here. Please
<a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2017/01/10/arch-linux-best-distro-ever">refer to Fabio post</a>,
since I discussed with him about it and we applied almost the same procedure.</p>
<p>The I/O related tunning are the most recommended.</p>
<h3 id="package-manager">Package manager</h3>
<p>There are some addition package managers available for Archlinux, so you can
deal with AUR easily. Fabio uses <a href="https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur">pacaur</a>
but I prefer to use <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aura-bin/">aura-bin</a>.</p>
<p>I know guys who prefer to use <a href="https://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en">yaourt</a> but I
don&rsquo;t think it has good defaults.</p>
<h3 id="installing-it-from-scratch">Installing it from scratch</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m that kind of Linux user who likes to install new distributions or rebuild
the system from time to time, so I created my own ways to do it faster.</p>
<p>I decided to not automate the whole Archlinux installation because it would take
more cost than bringing benefit. The partition of the disks and initial installation I do
manually and then I use my own scripts and configuration files to get the same
environment I had with just a few commands.</p>
<p>The first step is to install all packages needed to my day-to-day tasks. For
this matter I have
<a href="https://github.com/PotHix/pothix-dotfiles/blob/master/modules/so/archlinux/packages/gondor/dist/.config/packages">this script</a>. It executes many commands to install all packages I need.</p>
<p>I run
<a href="https://github.com/PotHix/pothix-dotfiles/blob/master/modules/terminal/shell/dist/bin/update-and">this script</a>
every time I decide to reboot my computer. So, instead of running <code>systemctl reboot</code> I
run <code>update-and reboot</code> and it reboots with the new packages installed.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Since I started used Linux I&rsquo;ve gone through Kurumin, Slackware, Ubuntu, and
Archlinux. I formatted my laptop many times and kept using Archlinux for the
past years, it&rsquo;s the best Linux distribution for my use case.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best cost/benefit for customization and effort doing
it, I really recommend <strong>Archlinux</strong> + <strong>Xfce</strong>. You will miss some new technologies on
the WM side (Wayland&hellip;) but it worth the trade-off.</p>

            <title>Stats for Jun, 2017</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/jun2017/</link>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;m ready to review my stats for June and share them with you! Are you? Hope so! :D
Books 
Last month I read Deep Work again because I was preparing to work for a new company. The new company is Doist, but this is a topic for a another post. It proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From their reading list I also took The score takes care of itself and Start with Why.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m ready to review my stats for June and share them with you! Are
you? Hope so! :D</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>Last month I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2sNBJQs">Deep Work</a> again because I
was preparing to work for a new company. The new company
is <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>, but this is a topic for a another post. It
proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From
their reading list I also
took <a href="http://amzn.to/2ubyLXo">The score takes care of itself</a>
and <a href="http://amzn.to/2syNucX">Start with Why</a>. Both are great books on
how to think your products and leadership, highly recommended!</p>
<p>Before joining I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2sz4oIx">The secrets of story</a>,
a great book on how to write novels and keep your reader turning
pages. There are many great tips there, I really recommend if you want
to write a novel someday.</p>
<p>The other one is <a href="http://amzn.to/2tBTV42">Louder than words</a>. It&rsquo;s all
about how we deal with meaning. It was interesting to think about
meaning as a concept beyond words, for computer scientists, think
about words as being pointers to a meaning. :)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, 4 books in a month, I&rsquo;m proud of myself :P</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file
from <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
968
708
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>968 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>708 articles
Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (861 unread and
662 read), I got around <strong>11% more unread articles</strong> and only <strong>6.5%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>It was a lot more unread articles and not so much read ones. I will
have to work on it again.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here goes the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post.</p>

<p>Looks like my coding productivity is back to normal. Hope to improve
my deep working this month.</p>
<p>Much of what I did was related to improve static pages and
documentation projects, so I have a lot of <code>bash</code> and <code>Markdown</code> as
most used languages.</p>

<p>A good progress this month and I have three more scheduled for next month. Go go go!</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>1 day and 23 hours</strong> of podcast time. It&rsquo;s a lot less than last
month, but that&rsquo;s common as I listened to many audiobooks instead.</p>
<p>I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just for the record, this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as &ldquo;most
listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to
<a href="http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm">CBN podcasts</a> almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. It&rsquo;s less
than what I&rsquo;m used to see but it&rsquo;s OK since I left my previous job and
took some days &ldquo;off&rdquo; (not exactly off, but that&rsquo;s it).</p>
<p>There is another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>Almost <strong>4x more than April</strong>. :D</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>For the first time (I think&hellip;) I reached my goal! New job + deep work FTW.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
<strong>10.6k</strong> steps (318/30), a lot more than next month (it was <strong>8.3k</strong>) \o/.</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>11.7km</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>My weight is almost the same:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>My sleep data:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Less average sleeping and less deep sleeping for this month. It&rsquo;s not
so much (around 10min avg for both), but I should keep an eye on it.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 35 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of <strong>Better call saul</strong>, two seasons of <strong>Sense
8</strong>, and <strong>Mr. Robot</strong> (finally! :D).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit confusing to calculate how many days I spent on TV shows
this month, but I now reached the mark of 1 month of time spent (or
wasted, pick your side) watching TV. =/</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>My stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>34156</strong> words written (<strong>26914</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>634</strong> corrections made (<strong>243</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>10332</strong> unique words (<strong>11478</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 8k words written compared to last month but also almost 3x more corrections made :(.
Unique words are less than next month but not so much.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>For some reason 1 country and 1 city is gone from my timeline, maybe I
did some cleanup but didn&rsquo;t remember. In the other hand, the amount of
places I visited increased by <strong>55</strong>! I&rsquo;m not sure why that happened,
since I did not traveled this month. It was probably some cleanup made
by Google Maps folks.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>I also decided to add the amount of time spent in a vehicle this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance" title="Location time and distance"></a></p>
<p>9 hours in the whole month! In contrast, I walked 111km, which is
probably part of my daily dog walking / Gym routine. <strong>Remote work
FTW</strong>!</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represents a small portion of 17% of net income</strong>, the
rest is being invested. Yeah, but again this was atypical month. I
know it&rsquo;s being repetitive already but as I&rsquo;m changing jobs, I
received some money related to Brazilian work law stuff (yeah, it&rsquo;s
complicated) and almost everything was invested. Part of this money
will be used in the next month, because I will not be able to generate
invoices yet, thanks to the very slow Brazilian processes to have your
own company.</p>
<p>I had to change my portfolio because of this changes in my
professional life and also because of the current state of economics
and politics in Brazil.</p>
<p>This month I increased my total savings by <strong>5.2%</strong> and reached
<strong>72.46%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.</p>
<p><strong>It took 4 hours and 03 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<p>Almost the double comparing to last month. As I had to change a lot of
things on my investment portfolio, it took some time to organize
everything again.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I feel great this month. :)</p>
<p>The new job is amazing and I can focus on my deep working routine to
actually do real stuff. I&rsquo;m still getting used to the new workflow and
software I have to support, but it&rsquo;s being an awesome experience.</p>
<p>Hope to have more good news next month.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Esse mês eu completaria 7 anos trabalhando para a Locaweb, mas decidi
sair no dia 2 de junho. Nada demais, só procurando coisas diferentes</p>
<p>Eu entrei na Locaweb em Junho de 2010. Na época
o <a href="https://fabiokung.com/">Fabio Kung</a> entrou em contato comigo perguntando se
eu queria me juntar a equipe de Cloud Computing.</p>
<h2 id="a-equipe-de-cloud">A equipe de Cloud</h2>
<p>Depois de uma conversa com ele e com outro gestor, eu descobri que era
<strong>exatamente</strong> o que eu queria fazer, trabalhar com Ruby e infraestrutura, duas
coisas que eu gostava muito.</p>
<p>Fui aprovado no processo seletivo e comecei na equipe que tinha várias pessoas
legais. Entre eles estavam algumas pessoas conhecidas na comunidade de Software
brasileira, principalmente na comunidade Ruby, como
o <a href="https://nandovieira.com">Nando Vieira</a>,
o <a href="https://fabiokung.com">Fabio Kung</a>,
o <a href="https://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu">Rafael Rosa</a> e mais algumas pessoas que
manjam bastante mas não costumam aparecer tanto. A equipe era composta de 50% de
desenvolvedores e 50% de sysadmins.</p>
<p>Nessa equipe eu tive que lidar com várias linguagens. <strong>Ruby</strong> era minha linguagem
principal, mas sempre tinha algumas linguagens diferentes para mexer. Alterei
código <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>ASP</strong>, <strong>ASP.net</strong> e <strong>Perl</strong>. Foi uma experiência fantástica, aprendi
bastante e mexi com coisas que não eram tão comuns para a galera que estava
trabalhando com Ruby e/ou Rails na época. Atualmente, 5 pessoas da equipe de
Cloud estão trabalhando em empresas grandes fora do país.</p>
<p>Não vou focar em datas, se quiser ver as datas, dê uma olhada
no <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willianmolinari/">meu Linkedin</a> que tem o tempo
que eu fiquei em cada cargo/equipe.</p>
<h2 id="a-equipe-de-iaas">A equipe de IaaS</h2>
<p>Depois de um tempo a equipe de Cloud virou parte da equipe de IaaS. Além de
manter a infraestrutura/aplicação de cloud, nós tinhamos outras
responsabilidades. Nessa equipe nós também mantinhamos as aplicações de
servidores dedicados, load balancer, backup e o painel unificado para todas
essas funcionalidades. Nessa época estavamos mais juntos com a equipe que estava
fazendo melhorias e automatização na infraestrutura. Partipei do
projeto <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">Openstack</a> enquanto desenvolviamos algumas
funcionalidades no Quantum
(agora <a href="https://github.com/openstack/neutron">Neutron</a>) e cheguei a participar
da
<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Design_Summit/Folsom">Openstack Design Summit em San Francisco</a>. Infelizmente,
pouco código que fizemos voltou para o trunk, mas foi divertido fazer parte do
projeto.</p>
<p>Nessa época eu comecei a organizar as Tech-talks internas, toda quinta-feira
tinhamos pessoas apresentando coisas técnicas e legais dentro da empresa. Foi um
grande desafio manter isso funcionando por quase 2 anos, religiosamente toda
quinta-feira sem muito suporte.</p>
<p>Usei bastante <strong>Ruby</strong> e <strong>Python</strong> nessa época. Das pessoas que trabalharam
nessa equipe, 3 estão trabalhando para fora do país de alguma forma. Duas delas
se mudaram para outro país e uma trabalha remotamente para uma empresa de
fora.</p>
<p>Também nessa época eu desenvolvi um projeto que em menos de 1 ano economizou
mais de 1 milhão em gastos. Havia uma possibilidade de otimização em outra
equipe, mas ninguém tinha tempo para atacar o problema. Eu pensei na solução
durante o fim de semana e tirei 2 dias para atacar o problema e mostrar uma POC
totalmente funcional para o CTO. Com isso consegui meu tempo para melhorar o
projeto e acompanhar os ganhos durante os próximos meses. Não tinha nada de
científico no projeto, era apenas Ruby, Threads, média simples (na primeira
versão), chamadas para algumas APIs internas para conseguir os dados necessários
e uma interface JSON.</p>
<p>Depois desse projeto eu mudei de equipe.</p>
<h2 id="a-equipe-de-infra-dev">A equipe de Infra-dev</h2>
<p>A equipe de infra-dev era composta por cerca de 8 pessoas bem experientes e de
áreas diferentes. Não funcionava muito bem como um time, mas atacava diversos
projetos ao mesmo tempo. Nessa equipe nós trabalhavamos em um nível abaixo do
que eu trabalhava em IaaS. Enquanto IaaS consumia APIs e entregava os produtos
para os clientes, Infra-dev fazia essas APIs e garantia que os assets estavam
bem usados. Basicamente trabalhavamos com código voltado para infraestrutura e
automação.</p>
<p>Além disso, trabalhavamos em melhorar as ferramentas para os
desenvolvedores. Saimos do Gitorious interno e migramos para o Gitlab,
entregamos libs de métricas, tinhamos um sistema de métricas desenvolvido
internamente e cuidavamos de alguns sistemas responsáveis por catálogo e
instalação de maquinas.</p>
<p>Nessa época eu tive a oportunidade de participar
da <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon">OSCON</a> em Portland, OR. Foi uma
experiência fantástica, com certeza uma das melhores conferências que eu já fui.</p>
<p>Nessa equipe tive contato com várias linguagens de programação. Mexi com
<strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong> e tive contato com
<strong>Haskell</strong> e <strong>clojure</strong>. Conheci pessoas que tinham um conhecimento enorme e
uma forma bem legal de lidar com problemas técnicos, foi uma experiência bem
interessante.</p>
<p>Das 8 pessoas que trabalharam comigo nessa equipe, 2 delas estão trabalhando
fora do país.</p>
<p>Depois de um tempo a equipe foi dividida para atacar coisas diferentes. Eu
fiquei mais próximo do pessoal de desenvolvimento do que do pessoal de
infraestrutura e propus a criação da equipe de ferramentas.</p>
<h2 id="a-equipe-de-ferramentas">A equipe de Ferramentas</h2>
<p>Há muito tempo eu via a necessidade de melhorar a produtividade do time de
desenvolvimento (cerca de 100 pessoas) e resolver alguns problemas grandes e
latentes que ninguém teria tempo para resolver. O gerente da época gostou da
ideia e começamos a equipe com apenas duas pessoas, que depois de alguns meses
ganhou mais uma pessoa.</p>
<p>Essa também foi uma equipe fantástica, começamos com duas pessoas que tinha no
mínimo 5 anos de empresa. Já sabiamos quais eram os problemas que nos
atrapalhavam, mas para ter certeza conversamos com pessoas várias equipes para
confirmar. Listamos os problemas e começamos os trabalhos.</p>
<p>Sou bem orgulhoso das coisas que criamos nessa equipe, acho que conseguimos
atingir o nível técnico que queríamos. :)</p>
<p>Tinhamos sistemas e ferramentas feitos com <strong>Elixir</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> e <strong>Go</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h2>
<p>Durante o tempo que eu trabalhei na Locaweb eu tive a chance de visitar 9
estados brasileiros, 2 estados americanos e 1 país europeu para conferências,
com as despesas pagas pela empresa. Meu salário mais do que triplicou durante
esses 7 anos. Consegui lidar com vários problemas técnicos interessantes e um
monte de linguagens de programação.</p>
<p>É claro que essas coisas não vem de graça. Para visitar todos esses lugares eu
corri atrás e criei conteúdo para apresentar e submeter para conferências,
aproveitando que a empresa apoiava tais atividades. Nos eventos que fui como
participante, é porque eu estava capacitado para conhecer as coisas ou
participar de discussões, além é claro, de repassar o conhecimento na volta.</p>
<p>Eu entrei ganhando relativamente pouco na época, mas para que o meu salário
chegasse ao nível que chegou durante esses 7 anos, eu tive que mostrar o meu
valor e me motivar a cada dia. Empresas grandes como a Locaweb (e outras) tem
bastante espaço para crescer, se você souber procurar. Mas tem bastante espaço
para ficar acomodado também, depende do caminho que você escolhe para você.</p>
<p>Lidei com vários problemas técnicos interessantes porque eu sempre estava
buscando por eles. Eu poderia estar fazendo apenas aplicações Ruby/Rails e
pegando os &ldquo;problemas mais fáceis&rdquo; ao invés disso.</p>
<p>Fora isso, teve os momentos de desconstração pós horário ou nos
intervalos. Conheci uns 3 ou 4 jogos de tabuleiro novos depois do horário, me
fizeram comprar mais cartas para incrementar meu deck de Magic the Gathering
para jogar contra algumas pessoas, perdi feio em 2 campeonatos de Street Fighter
IV, perdi no campeonato de ping-pong e rompi o ligamento do ombro esquerdo
jogando basquete com alguns colegas de trabalho na quadra próxima durante o
horário de almoço. Acho que esportes não são a minha praia. :P</p>
<p>Apesar desse monte de coisas legais, a Locaweb, como todas as outras empresas,
não é perfeita. É uma empresa grande, que já foi familiar, que tem quase 20 anos
de história e que já teve (não sei como está hoje) mais de 1000
funcionários. Trabalhar em uma empresa com essas características e achar que
pode fazer coisas que você faz em uma startup é ser um pouco ingênuo.</p>
<p>Para trabalhar em empresas grandes, você tem que estar preparado para lidar com
burocracia desnecessária e politica, e a Locaweb não é exceção. Lá não é tão
burocrático como outras empresas que vemos por aí, onde você sabe que nem vale a
pena tentar enfrentar o que está ruim. Eles ficam num nível que parece que a
burocracia pode ser vencida se algumas pessoas decidirem ter um pensamento mais
&ldquo;pra frente&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Como a amostragem é grande, você encontra de tudo. Pessoas muito boas
subvalorizadas, pessoas ruins supervalorizadas, pessoas boas que se encostaram
com o passar do tempo, pessoas em cargos errados e outras coisas. Nada muito
diferente de outras empresas grandes por aí.</p>
<p>A parte técnica sempre foi resolvida, esses tipos de problemas o pessoal tira
&ldquo;de letra&rdquo;. ;)</p>
<h2 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h2>
<p>Eu e a empresa estamos em <em>vibes</em> diferentes no momento e eu decidi tentar
outras coisas, mas é uma empresa fantástica que eu com certeza trabalharia
novamente. Eu diria, assim como vários amigos que trabalharam comigo por lá
dizem, que foi a melhor empresa que eu já trabalhei. Nunca tinha ficado mais de
1 ano e meio em uma empresa e fiquei 7 anos lá (uma média de 1 ano e 8 meses por
equipe).</p>
<p>Sobre mim? Começo em outra empresa na semana que vem, provavelmente comentarei
mais sobre isso em breve. :)</p>

            <title>Wordpress to Middleman, to Hugo using github-pages and HTTPS</title>

            <description>Yes, it was a journey. I decided to chance my blog engine again.
But this time I decided to post about the whole transition, since I started my blog, back in 2008.
I needed a blog at the time but could not spend time creating something, I just wanted to &amp;ldquo;buy a blog&amp;rdquo; and write. Dreamhost was an awesome service for that. In one hour I bought a domain, installed a Wordpress via one click install and set up my own email via Google apps (at the time it was free).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it was a journey. I decided to chance my blog engine again.</p>
<p>But this time I decided to post about the whole transition, since I started my
blog, <a href="https://pothix.com/post/primeiro-post-por-aqui/">back in 2008</a>.</p>
<p>I needed a blog at the time but could not spend time creating something, I just
wanted to &ldquo;buy a blog&rdquo; and write. Dreamhost was an awesome service for that. In
one hour I bought a domain, installed a Wordpress via one click install and set
up my own email via Google apps (at the time it was free).</p>
<p>Wordpress is a good blog engine, it just works. You have to keep it updated
because of security risks, but it works. I wrote some plugins and customized
themes during the years I used it and it worked just fine. Please, don&rsquo;t say bad
things about Wordpress, it solved more problems and is great for so many
people. :)</p>
<p>After some years I decided it was time to cancel my Dreamhost account. I had
just some small websites there and all of them could become static pages. That&rsquo;s
what I did.</p>
<p>All my website were converted to static web pages and migrated to Github pages,
including this blog. But let&rsquo;s focus on this blog for a while.</p>
<h2 id="migrating-from-wordpress-to-middleman">Migrating from Wordpress to Middleman</h2>
<p>I was already using markdown for my blog posts because I was posting from Vim
using <a href="https://github.com/pothix/vimpress">Vimpress</a>. So I had to convert all
other posts from HTML to Markdown.</p>
<p>My old layout was not good anymore. I was looking for something responsive and
used the migration to get the courage to change the layout as well. I bought a
Wordpress layout and converted it to <code>.erb</code> for Middleman.</p>
<p>I was using Wordpress comment system and I decided to not migrate to
Disqus. Today I know that I could do that, but at the time I decided to just
abandon the old comments. But I wanted to keep the names of everyone that wrote
a comment in the article.</p>
<p>Most of the migration was done
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/PotHix/e78c75281d4f1c508e89">a Ruby script</a> that I
created. These are the steps needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download an <code>.xml</code> backup of your Wordpress posts with comments</li>
<li>Change the script to use the correct file name and blacklist comments</li>
<li>Run the script</li>
</ul>
<p>The script will convert all posts from HTML to Markdown and create individual
files for every post, following the middleman style.</p>
<p>You just have to check every post and fix images.</p>
<p>In my case, it was harder than that because I was creating a blog from scratch
but using the same content. But at the end, it worth the work.</p>
<h2 id="migrating-from-middleman-to-hugo">Migrating from Middleman to Hugo</h2>
<p>For some reason, I decided to not post about my blog engine change this year. I
was using <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">middleman</a>
since <a href="https://pothix.com/post/new-layout-of-pothix-blog/">May 2015</a>, but
decided to change to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I promised myself that I would not change my blog engine to Hugo just because it
looks cool. And then Middleman started to work weird, sometimes the <code>middleman serve</code> serves my content as plain text instead of HTML. It was hard to try it
locally before publishing.</p>
<p>It was everything I needed to try a new blog engine (haha). This migration was
simpler. I just had to understand how Hugo works and how the template
language works.</p>
<p>To convert middleman format to Hugo I used a big <code>sed</code> command that I can&rsquo;t
reproduce anymore. haha</p>
<p>As usual, I used the migration as an excuse to do more things. Since 2008 I
change my URLs layout many times. So, I used Google Analytics to get these old
URLs and added them as <a href="https://gohugo.io/extras/aliases/">aliases</a> in Hugo. The
old URLs now work with the current blog.</p>
<p>Some advantages of Hugo:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s just a binary, I don&rsquo;t have to install anything beyond that. (<code>aura -S hugo-bin</code> :D)</li>
<li>It builds *<em>really</em> fast, it&rsquo;s not fair to compare with middleman (Go X Ruby)</li>
<li>There are some great features, like aliases</li>
<li>I really like the live-reloading by default</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="https">HTTPS</h2>
<p>I was missing the HTTPS feature, but it was not possible to use it when using
Github-pages, at least not for custom domains.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="https://www.sergioaugrod.com.br/offtopic/2017/05/14/migrando-do-ghost-para-o-github-pages.html">this post (pt-BR)</a>
I found that it would be possible to use HTTPS, even in Github-pages, and <strong>for free</strong>.</p>
<p>The solution: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>!</p>
<p>Cloudflare has a free plan that is sufficient for many blogs out there. You just
have to create your account and point your <code>ns</code> entries to their servers. By
doing that you can even use HSTS! :D</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy with the current setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo is a great platform</li>
<li>Github is fast, simple and free</li>
<li>My new layout has the features I need</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to change</li>
</ul>
<p>Static pages are the future&hellip; again&hellip; haha</p>

            <description>Here we go again for my stats for the last month. :)
Books 
I will start a in a new company this month, so I decided to re-read Deep Work (I really recommend this one). This book is just great for everyone who wants to focus and do the hard work. It has everything to do with my new work schedule. The book about Elon Musk was a good reading as well, this guy has some great ideas.</description>

Read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month, I got almost
<strong>5% more unread articles</strong>, but this time I got almost <strong>10% more
read articles</strong> (double of the last month&rsquo;s). It happened
because I took some hours to read the some articles of my Pocket
account.</p>

<p>The chart for this month is really better than last month&rsquo;s but still
less than what I was expecting.</p>
<p>Back to Ruby this month, there were some old Rails projects to work. But most of my time was spent on the Terminal, for a change.</p>

<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is
my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>

<p>It was the equivalent to <strong>3 days and 9 hours</strong> of podcast time (I tend
to speed up all my podcasts, so I don&rsquo;t know how much time it took for
real). It&rsquo;s <strong>almost 15 hours more</strong> than April.</p>
<p>I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/may/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/may/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<p>Just for the record, this is an &ldquo;all time list&rdquo;. :)</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking
software, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/may/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/may/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>

<p>My data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a> is better than last month but not good enough yet:</p>

<p>Maybe next month I will reach the target.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/may/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/may/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
<strong>8.3k</strong> steps (260/31).</p>
<p>And these are my steps each day:</p>

<p>The peak was in a nice Sunday when I met some friends to chit-chat in a local park. It was just 3 of us talking and walking around the park.</p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>12.7km</strong> walking in that same Sunday:</p>

<p>I lost some kg this month. This is a good sign, I think.</p>

<p>This month I slept less but with more deep sleep:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/may/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/may/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>I think this is a good sign as well. I want to sleep better, not sleep
more.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 39 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/may/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/may/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>More than 18 of them is still part of our (my wife and me) <strong>How I
met your mother</strong> marathon. The other episodes are a combination of <strong>Better call saul</strong>, <strong>13 reasons why</strong>, and <strong>Sense 8</strong>.</p>
<p>I spent almost 1 day of my life watching TV Series this month.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately, they only send weekly emails, I don&rsquo;t know if I will keep these metrics because it take some time to build it.</p>
<p>Anyways, here is the data for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>26914</strong> words written</li>
<li><strong>243</strong> corrections made</li>
<li><strong>11478</strong> unique words</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to remove my &ldquo;common mistakes&rdquo; from this report because the
data seems to be not reliable.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>This month I visited 18 new places (the last month were <strong>338 places</strong>) and 1 new city:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/may/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/may/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/may/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/may/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represent only 47% of net income</strong>, the rest is being
invested. Just like last month, this was atypical as well. Last month
I received the money related to my freelance work on January and March
and now I had to pay the taxes related to it.</p>
<p>This month increased my total savings by <strong>1%</strong>.
I have <strong>68.83%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending almost no time to collect the data, most part of it is
automatic. The services that require manual interaction are already
part of my day-to-day life, so I&rsquo;m not tracking it.</p>
<p><strong>It took 2 hours and 30 minutes to write this post</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This month was better than the last one. It was not so good as I
expected because I had to do some exams to be sure I&rsquo;m OK and I was
also changing jobs. I was working for the same company for the last 7
years and decide to try something else, but this is a subject for a
different post. ;)</p>
<p>I got two weeks to &ldquo;relax&rdquo; (cof&hellip; work on some personal
projects&hellip; cof), so I don&rsquo;t know exactly how the next month will
be. Let&rsquo;s wait for the next post! :)</p>

            <description>This was not a good month. I spent most of the time sick, recovering from what may be a Labyrinthitis. I still have to confirm that, but I&amp;rsquo;m in slow motion for a while.
But anyways, let&amp;rsquo;s go to the collected data.
Books Books for this month:

&amp;ldquo;Einstein no Brasil&amp;rdquo; (Einstein in Brazil) is a physical book I borrowed from a friend and The Art of The Lord of the Rings I have in my shelf (as a good LotR fan).</description>

<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>It was going well at the beginning but then I got sick and my
productivity is dropped with it.</p>
<p>I was playing with Python a little bit, so I had Python, Ruby and Go
as the most used languages for this month:</p>

<p>Emacs is my main editor but Vim is still there. I <a href="https://github.com/irondoge/bash-wakatime">configured my Bash to send reports to Wakatime as well</a>.</p>

<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no presentations for this month. My goal for
this year is to beat <a href="http://milhouseonsoftware.com.br">Milhouse</a> best
score (19 presentations last year). Here is my burn down chart for
this (actually, a burn up [?]):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>As I said in my last stats post, I&rsquo;m back
to
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a>. This
time I decided to buy the application, the developer deserves it. Here is the data:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p>I removed some data to become easy to see April stats. It was 2 days
and 18 hours listening to Podcasts this month.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m using Podcast Addict again, I decided to keep a list of the
Podcasts and their times as well.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title"></a></p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my current time
tracking, <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. There is
another chart for my personal projects:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>My data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a> is not so good for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>But I was expecting something like that already =/</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>As expected my average of steps a day dropped. Currently it&rsquo;s around <strong>6k steps</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>9.3km</strong> walking:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>My weight is almost the same for the whole month. There is a visible
outlier because I was testing a different application and inserted an
invalid value. My fault.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>Again, I slept more this month but with less deep sleeping, but just 1
minute less:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 22 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a combination of <strong>Better call saul</strong>, <strong>Sense 8</strong>, and
<strong>How I met your mother</strong>. As you can see, the first days of May
already have a lot of episodes watches, and it&rsquo;s because of a <strong>How I
met your mother</strong> marathon.</p>
<p>I spent almost 1 day of my life watching TV Series this month.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>This month I visited 13 more places (the last month were <strong>325 places</strong>):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, so I don&rsquo;t know if I will keep these
metrics because it take some time to build it. Here is an example of
the data sent via email:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/grammarly.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/grammarly.png" alt="Example data of grammarly weekly" title="Example data of grammarly weekly"></a></p>
<p>Anyways, here is the data for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>37844</strong> words written</li>
<li><strong>168</strong> corrections made</li>
<li><strong>15160</strong> unique words</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are my common mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>267</strong> Possibly confused preposition</li>
<li><strong>100</strong> Missing comma in compound sentence</li>
<li><strong>38</strong> Confused preposition</li>
<li><strong>6</strong> Comma splice</li>
<li><strong>4</strong> Missing comma after introductory phrase</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>My expenses for this month are balanced again:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/apr/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/apr/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart <strong>represent only 15% of net income</strong>, the rest is being
invested. This month was atypical because I received the money related
to my freelance work on January and March. I also received the yearly
bonus from my full time job.</p>
<p>This month increased my total savings by <strong>9%</strong>! Pretty good! :)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It was not so nice to be sick, as expected. My productivity dropped a
little bit and I have to go to the doctor this month and look for it.</p>
<p>Hope to be in a good health next month. :)</p>

            <description>Back to work this month. :)
After one month vacation, I got back to my routine and got some good results this month.
Books Added three more books to the list:

I have to note here that Mastery is one of the best books I ever read. Both Mindfulness in plain English and The Urban Monk are about meditation and how to live a minimalist life.
Articles I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to find a way to track the articles I read.</description>

<a href="http://amzn.to/2rdNYFy">Mastery</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1642811841">is one of the best books I ever read</a>.
Both <a href="http://amzn.to/2s60AzW">Mindfulness in plain English</a>
and <a href="http://amzn.to/2so5lYE">The Urban Monk</a> are about meditation and

<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to find a way to track the articles I read. In the past months I&rsquo;ve being adding all of them to Pocket and reading there. Unfortunately I could not find anything to build information from my pocket reading data (suggestions welcome).</p>
<p>For now I&rsquo;m just <a href="https://getpocket.com/export">exporting my content in HTML format</a> and using a simple Javascript to count it:</p>
<pre><code>var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
for(var i=0; i&lt;uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}

760
570
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>760 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>570 articles
Read</strong>. Let&rsquo;s see how it will be next month. ;)</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a> since the last post. Let&rsquo;s check the new ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>There is no colors or day numbers anymore but it looks better to
understand how many hours I&rsquo;ve been working through the month. It&rsquo;s still less than what I was expecting, but that&rsquo;s the main idea, time to improve!</p>
<p>Ruby and Go are the most used languages for this month:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Markdown is just my posts here. LOL</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shifting from Vim to Emacs, but I still use Vim a lot:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>Presentations for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech-talk at <a href="https://locaweb.com.br">Locaweb</a>. It was a Tech-talk about <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>. Every time I go to a conference I schedule a talk to explore the content I saw there. I consider that a good practice with my coworkers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gaveteiro.com.br">Gaveteiro</a> it was the same presentation that inspired <a href="https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br">my book</a> but with a small audience. It took <strong>1h 52min</strong> and was pretty cool (at least for me). :)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Back to Podcasts again! This time I decided to try a different Podcast
player after many years using
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a>. I bought <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/">Pocketcasts</a> and I used it for the whole month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/podcasts.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/podcasts.png" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the <em>&ldquo;Since 29th of January&rdquo;</em> because I did not used
any podcast player in February. ;)</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know what these numbers mean. But 1 day of podcast
listening make sense for me. I usually listen podcasts 3x faster, this
is what causes the confusion. :P</p>
<p>I will probably get back to Podcast Addict in April, because it&rsquo;s
superior in many features. Maybe I will write about it soon.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>My time tracking with <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> is more mature now.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>Besides the <strong>206h30min</strong> I have <strong>6h30min</strong> working on my personal
projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a> says I reached my goal for the month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great. :)</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>Back to the old rhythm, around <strong>10k steps</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>My max distance was <strong>11.5km</strong> walking:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>My weight is not there yet, but I&rsquo;m still tracking:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>I slept more this month but with less deep sleeping:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 29 episodes this month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a combination
of <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com/en/show/260449">Vikings</a>, <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com/pt_BR/show/304219">Luke Cage</a>
and <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com/en/show/317953">Iron Fist</a>.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>This month was not so exciting like the last one, but I worked on
my <a href="https://www.google.com.br/maps/timeline">Google Timeline</a> data to
make it more accurate. Some cities were removed but I have identified
more places I visited:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>Phew&hellip; finally my expenses are getting back to normal, no more <em>travel</em> taking 50%+ of it. But it&rsquo;s still taking 25%+. :P</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/mar/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/mar/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>This chart of expenses <strong>represent 46% of net income</strong>, the rest is being invested.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be back and see my productivity data growing. I still
want to improve my expenses because it&rsquo;s not as I expect it to
be. Maybe next month. :)</p>

            <description>February was an atypical month because I was on vacation. :)
Much of my stats will reflect my travel around Europe. But no coding was done during this trip.

<p>Much of my stats will reflect my travel around Europe. But no coding was done during this trip.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>Continuing my goal to <strong>read 30 books this year</strong>, I read two books this month:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>I had plans to visit Amsterdam and Oxford during my travel. Because of
that I decided to read
the <a href="http://amzn.to/2s6lQ8S">story of Kullervo</a>, which mention a lot
about J.R.R Tolkien past (it was one of his first stories),
and <a href="http://amzn.to/2sx2w7o">The Diary of a Young Girl</a>, because I had
plans to visit Anne Frank&rsquo;s house in Amsterdam.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>As I said in the beginning, there was no coding this month. I left São Paulo in Feb 2 and got back in Feb 28. So, my <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a> charts are empty for this month.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>The whole reason of this month&rsquo;s trip was to speak
at <a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>. I planned the talk to be fast, but
as it was my first English talk in a conference and I was pretty
nervous, I spoke faster than I was expecting. :P</p>
<p>This was the only talk for this month, if you want to check it out go to <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/desktops_open_source_behind_web_request/">the talk page in the FOSDEM website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve downloaded some podcasts and audiobooks to listen during this
trip but did not listened to any of them. I was in a different mood
during the trip. :)</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Guess what!? No working hours this month as well :P</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>Hm, that was huge! haha</p>
<p>This is the chart for steps. It may not be clear, but the peak is <strong>34k+ steps in one day</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>As you may expect by the amount of steps, the distance is high as well. My max was <strong>31.5km walking in Feb 6th</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>By using miband, I can also track the amount of sleep for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>I was waking up pretty early during the trip. :)</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.google.com.br/maps/timeline">Google Timeline</a>
to track the places I&rsquo;m visiting.</p>
<p>This month I received the first email with a summary of the new places
I visited during the month. If you have an Android phone and you don&rsquo;t
like this tracking, just disable it in Google location tracking.</p>
<p>This month was interesting to share because of my vacation travel. I
visited some new countries:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-countries.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-countries.png" alt="Countries visited this month" title="Countries visited this month"></a></p>
<p>Some cities in those countries:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-cities.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-cities.png" alt="Cities visited this month" title="Cities visited this month"></a></p>
<p>And many places in those cities:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-places.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-places.png" alt="Places visited this month" title="Places visited this month"></a></p>
<p>In general, I visited many places since it started tracking my
location:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>I will not always share all those images, but at least big picture will be here as a benchmark :)</p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;m planning to do for a long time now but never got
the chance. I always keep track of my expenses and now I decided to
publish here as well. It will not have values (because it don&rsquo;t need
to), but here is the chart for my expenses by category:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month (yes&hellip; pt-BR =/)" title="Expenses by category this month. Categories in pt-BR =/"></a></p>
<p>Most part of my expenses was covering the travel expenses for my
Eurotrip this month. But this chart of expenses <strong>represent only 22%
of net income</strong> for this month because of the month salary and
&ldquo;bonuses&rdquo; we got before leaving for vacation.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>February was a different month, I cannot compare it with the other ones, but it was pretty great. There are some posts about the events of this month in case you want to read
it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pothix.com/post/oxford-for-tolkien-fans/">Oxford for Tolkien fans</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pothix.com/post/fosdem-survival-guide/">FOSDEM Survival Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pothix.com/post/my-presentation-at-fosdem-2017/">My presentation at FOSDEM 2017</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to get back to work.</p>

<a href="https://www.truevalhalla.com/about">Matthew of truevalhalla.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>My goal is to <strong>read 30 books this year</strong>, so I must have an average
of 2.5 books per month. I read two this month:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2swOiTZ">Outliers</a> is a great book, I really recommend
it. It talks about the 10.000 hours role to master
something. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2sjkxoT">Memory Illusion</a> is about how
your mind trick you creating false memories.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>To track my time coding I&rsquo;m
using <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a> (this link is a
referral, use it in case you want to try it out).</p>
<p>By using it I can see the amount of hours I spent programming:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the colors in this chart, each project has it&rsquo;s own color but it&rsquo;s not relevant for this case. My best best day was Jan 19th, almost 12h coding.</p>
<p>Now we can check the languages I&rsquo;m using:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>I have no idea what this &ldquo;Other&rdquo; means. The purple one
is <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. I&rsquo;m playing with it and it&rsquo;s
great.</p>
<p>Here is the controversial fact. My text editors:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Forget about Chrome, I was testing a feature from Wakatime. But yes,
I&rsquo;m using both Vim and Emacs. :P</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>I spoke three times this month, here is the list and descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://campuscode.com.br/">Campus Code</a>, it was opening the <em>Quero
ser dev</em> program. I was talking about the chooses we made as
developers during our careers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.impacta.com.br">Impacta</a>, speaking about what what
happens behind a web request. This is the presentation that
inspired <a href="https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br">my book</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://campuscode.com.br/">Campus Code</a>, after 6+ rehearsals I was
trying my talk &ldquo;Open source behind a web request&rdquo; for an actual
audience. It was my first talk in English.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of audio programs. I have many audiobooks and podcasts in my collection and I listen to them whenever possible.</p>
<p>This is my stats for this month, thanks to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png"><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p>The big numbers is my total time, but look at the &ldquo;January 2017&rdquo; time.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m testing <a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> to track my working hours. This
is the first month and here are the results:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a> to
track my apps on my cellphone and personal computer. It still needs
some tuning but here are my goal of 3 productive hours per day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>I will work on that.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I try to keep a regular physical activity. After buying a simple and cheap <a href="http://www.mi.com/en/miband/">Mi band</a> I can track it better. It&rsquo;s integrated with <a href="https://fit.google.com">Google Fit</a>, so I can extract all those nice charts.</p>
<p>This is the amount of steps this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png" alt="Amount of steps for this month" title="Amount of steps for this month"></a></p>
<p>Distance by day:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png" alt="Travelled distance this month" title="Travelled distance this month"></a></p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also tracking my weight, which is improving! :)</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="My weight for this month" title="My weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>By using miband, I can also track the amount of sleep for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately this app does not know how to deal with sleep time when
you sleep after midnight. This is the main reason why it says I&rsquo;m
going to sleep at 07:20 and I&rsquo;m waking up 07:18 (???). I will
workaround this bug by avoiding to sleep after midnight, as I&rsquo;m waking up
around 6. :P</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t watch so much TV but it&rsquo;s a hobby of mine (and my wife) to
watch TV Shows on Netflix. We also watch Game of thrones on HBO when available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> to track it and here is my stats for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;m planning to do for a long time now but never got
the chance. I always keep track of my expenses and now I decided to
publish here as well. It will not have values (because it don&rsquo;t need
to), but here is the chart for my expenses by category:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>Yeah, I know, all categories in pt-BR. This chart comes from a
Brazilian app called <a href="https://www.guiabolso.com.br/">GuiaBolso</a> and
it&rsquo;s the best I have for the moment. As you may expect, it takes a lot
of time to collect all these data, so I will keep it as is for a
while.</p>
<p>Most part of my expenses was covering the travel expenses for my
Eurotrip next of February.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This is the first post, so there are many details missing. The idea is
to start &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and keep improving in the next months. As it&rsquo;s not
so easy to write posts like these, I&rsquo;m trying to create some
&ldquo;templates&rdquo; for it.</p>
<p>It was a pretty good experience to see all that data together. :)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes in the next months.</p>

            <title>Oxford for Tolkien fans</title>

            <description>TL;DR: When traveling to Europe, I decided to take 2 or 3 days to visit Oxford. I will describe how was the experience of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan there.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien. Have read most of his books, the ones released when he was still alive and other edited by Christopher Tolkien.
After attending FOSDEM I decided to travel around some countries in Europe and UK. The most expensive part, the airplane tickets (Brazil -&amp;gt; Europe), were already paid, so&amp;hellip; why not?</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien. Have read most of his books, the ones released
when he was still alive and other edited by Christopher Tolkien.</p>
<p>After attending <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> I decided to travel around some
countries in Europe and UK. The most expensive part, the airplane tickets
(Brazil -&gt; Europe), were already paid, so&hellip; why not? :)</p>
<p>The last step of this journey would be London. Then I realized: &ldquo;Why not to
visit Oxford?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a historical city and Tolkien himself wrote most part of
his books there.</p>
<p>I used Oxfordbus company as transport from Heathrow Airport to Oxford center. I
choose a cozy house to say via Airbnb for 3 days and 2 nights.</p>
<p>Everything in Oxford closes really early. I got there around 4pm and there was
nothing to do anymore. I tried to visit the Bodleian Library, but it was
closing. All colleges were closed. The only thing to do is to look for a place
to eat.</p>
<p>The first stop for real was Eagle and Child. This was the pub where the Inklings
met once a week in the morning. For those who don&rsquo;t know the Inklings, it was a
small group which J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were members. They used to talk
about their books in these meetings. The Lord of the Rings had their first
drafts showed in this pub, probably. It&rsquo;s a good place to eat, I liked it.</p>
<p>I was lucky to be in Oxford in a Wednesday, they have extended tours around the
Bodleian Library and Radcliff camera on Wednesdays and Saturdays. There were
some good stories about it, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s almost impossible for a
tourist to see any of the Tolkien&rsquo;s manuscripts or original materials. In order
to get access to it you need to have the Readers card. In order to obtain it,
you have to pay and justify <em>why</em> you need to have access to the them. So&hellip; No
manuscripts for me.</p>
<p>The guide of the Bodleian Library did not know anything about Tolkien, just the
history behind the Radcliff camera and the Bodleian Library. The extended tour
is expensive (£24, I think) but worth the price.</p>
<p>I went to the Weston Library, where they have a treasury room with a free
exposition. There I found a original drawing from Tolkien. But the other
manuscripts were already removed because they are planning to close this
exposition (as they said&hellip;).</p>
<p>Tolkien was a teacher at Merton College, you have to pay £4 to enter there if
you want to. After asking about Tolkien places to visit, I found that none of
the places I would like to visit in there were open to the public.</p>
<p>From the inside I could see (through the gate&hellip;) the rounded table that may
have inspired the meeting that created the fellowship of the ring.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/oxford-for-tolkien-fans/council-of-elrond-merton.jpg" alt="fellowship of the ring" title="Round table"></p>
<p>I got this picture thanks to my 55-250mm lens, but it is not so close from the
gate. To enter there you have to be a Merton associate (or something like
that). But is still a good place to visit.</p>
<p>I decided to visit Magdalen College (£5) to walk in the &ldquo;Addison&rsquo;s Walk&rdquo; where
the Inklings talked about religion and where C.S Lewis was converted to
Christianity. Unfortunately, the wind was causing some threes to fall down and
they had to close the place for security reasons.</p>
<p>There was a exposition in the old library of the Magdalen College and it was
cool to see the old books. From the times they still had chains in the shelves. :)</p>
<p>There is a good place to find Tolkien books, in case you&rsquo;re interested. Go
to
<a href="https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Blackwell's+Bookshop/@51.7545513,-1.2554288,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x998ba5c1ca8ff22f!2sBlackwell's+Bookshop!8m2!3d51.7546524!4d-1.2555315!3m4!1s0x0:0x998ba5c1ca8ff22f!8m2!3d51.7546524!4d-1.2555315">Blackwell Bookshop</a> and
look for the shelf dedicated to J.R.R Tolkien.</p>
<p>In the last day, I decided to go to the cemetery where Tolkien was buried
(Wolvercote cemetery). It&rsquo;s not so far, but almost 1 hour walking. There are
some buses that take you there easily, just go to the bus station to get
information. I like to walk around the cities I visit, so we went there walking.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/oxford-for-tolkien-fans/tolkien-tombstone.jpg" alt="Tolkien tombstone" title="Tombstone of J.R.R Tolkien"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple tombstone, nothing spectacular, but I&rsquo;m glad to get there.</p>
<p>Then we came back walking and passed in front of the house he lived with his
family for some time.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-around-oxford">Other things around Oxford</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re already in Oxford, so I recommend you to visit the Blenheim Palace. It&rsquo;s
expensive £23 (go by bus and buy the tickets on the bus because it&rsquo;s cheaper
than buying there) but worth the price. It&rsquo;s not the Highclere Castle from
Downton Abbey, but some rooms were made me think about it. :)</p>
<p>Walk around the Carfax Tower and the Oxford castle. I liked both structures. The
interesting part about the Carfax Tower is that it is there since 900 a.c.</p>
<p>The architecture for all colleges is really impressive, just walk around them if
you like it. I&rsquo;m a big fan of these kinds of architectures, so I enjoyed walking
around them and taking pictures (yes, I like photography too!).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-about-my-tolkien-tour">Conclusion about my Tolkien Tour</h3>
<p>There are some other pictures related to Tolkien
in <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/U6T3zf66nwWAwi7G6">this Google photos album</a>.</p>
<p>I was expecting to see more materials from Tolkien. There were no expositions
about him, the only thing I saw was a drawing. I know that all (or at least,
many) of his manuscripts are available at the Bodleian Library, but they&rsquo;re not
accessible.</p>
<p>The city do not use the fact that Tolkien lived there as touristic
attraction. The only place referencing Tolkien was the Eagle and Child.</p>
<p>But Oxford is a good city to visit. There is a lot of history there. I just
recommend you, J.R.R. Tolkien fan, to align your expectations with what is
there.</p>

            <description>TL;DR: It was my first time at FOSDEM and it took some time to feel comfortable, this post may help newcomers.
As I mentioned in my previous post, I spoke at FOSDEM this year. It was my first time there (in the whole Europe, btw!) and it took some time to get used to the way the event goes. This post will show some tips that may help FOSDEM newcomers and maybe some veterans as well.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It was my first time at <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> and it
took some time to feel comfortable, this post may help newcomers.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I spoke
at <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> this year. It was my first time there
(in the whole Europe, btw!) and it took some time to get used to the
way the event goes. This post will show some tips that may help FOSDEM
newcomers and maybe some veterans as well.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-fosdem">What is FOSDEM?</h3>
<p>FOSDEM is the <em>Free and Open Source Developers - European
Meeting</em>. Long story short, it&rsquo;s a big self organized event that
happens in Brussels every year since 2013.</p>
<p>The conference has many Devrooms organized by volunteers with a
predefined schedule guided by topic. Aside of that are the main
tracks, that are some unique presentations happening in some big
rooms.</p>
<p>The whole event survives from donations and some sponsors, but it&rsquo;s
not organized by a company (like OSCON, for example). There are many
volunteers that work hard to make it happen.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>The conference happens at the Université libre de Bruxelles, using
some buildings of the university.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/fosdem-survival-guide/map.png" alt="Map of FOSDEM buildings" title="FOSDEM map"></p>
<p>All the tracks are spread across these buildings. Depending on where
you are, you have to reserve some time to reach the other building. It
is not so far, but may take 10 or 15 minutes depending on your
location.</p>
<p>Think about the time it will take on the transition in case you want
to watch as many presentations as possible. Also, plan ahead your time
to be at the room because it may be full when you get there&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="full-rooms">FULL rooms</h3>
<p>FOSDEM is chaotic. It&rsquo;s is a good and a bad thing at the same time.</p>
<p>Conferences like these, organized by the community for the community,
are the kinds of events I really like. They tend to be chaotic, but it
means people are free to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>They can walk through the university and watch whatever they
want. FOSDEM publishes a big schedule with information about all the
presentations happening across all rooms and you may create your on
schedule. I did it before going but forgot to consider the time
between buildings and the &ldquo;FULL&rdquo; rooms.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/fosdem-survival-guide/full-room.jpg" alt="The &ldquo;FULL&rdquo; sign" title="Full rooms"></p>
<p>There are some limits that need to be respected, one of them is the
number of people inside the room. When the room is fulfilled with
people they add a &ldquo;FULL&rdquo; sign at the door and nobody is authorized to
enter. It make sense, but is really annoying for newcomers.</p>
<p>When planning your schedule, plan to get to the room at least 15
minutes before it starts.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: instead of jump between many rooms, it&rsquo;s a good idea to
choose one or two and stay there for 2 or more presentations. It will
guarantee a spot for you in the room.</p>
<p>My schedule did not consider the time walking between buildings and
the full rooms, so&hellip; could not enter in 4+ rooms I wanted to be in.</p>
<h3 id="lunch">Lunch</h3>
<p>There are some food trucks there. They do not give you a receipt (in
case your company is refunding your travel, you may need it), so be
prepared for that.</p>
<p>It tend to be crowded at peak hours (noon, maybe?), try to get
something to eat before or after. But be warned that it is almost
<em>always</em> crowded. :)</p>
<p>The conference don&rsquo;t have any breaks, if you want to eat something,
you will have to decide to not watch a presentation and use the time
for it.</p>
<h3 id="parties">Parties</h3>
<p>They have a pre-conference party at Delirium. The bar is closed for
conference members only (they ask some tech questions to get you in
:P). It is not a huge place to have everyone in, so it will be
<strong>really</strong> crowded and hot there. Almost the same amount of people
will be chatting and drinking outside of the bar as well.</p>
<p>After the first day of conference, there is a second party, usually in
a hacker space in Brussels.</p>
<h3 id="presentations">Presentations</h3>
<p>Always read the presentation description. Some of them has &ldquo;click
bait&rdquo; (attend bait in this case?) title, sometimes not intended. I
attended to one of them about a language development. I was expecting
something about the day-to-day of the language development and what
features are planned for the future. Unfortunately, it was not what I
(and many people in the room) were expecting. It was about the metrics
and dashboards of the language contributors and features.</p>
<p>In this case, it was not probably not intentional, but almost 50% of
the room left before the presentation ended.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>FOSDEM is a great event, I really enjoyed it! I would like to have
received these tips before, so I would have planned my day better.</p>
<p>Hope it helps the 2018 FOSDEM attendants. o/</p>

            <description>This year my proposal to speak at FOSDEM was accepted and I spoke at the Desktop devroom! :)
It was my first talk in English, so I decided to do as many rehearsals as I could. I was 8 in total, but as expected, it was still a little bit faster than expected. :P
I had 30 minutes to present and I did it in 26. I usually speak fast and this presentation was made to be fast because I had a lot of content to show in 30 minutes.</description>

presentation <strong>was made to be fast</strong> because I had a lot of content to show in
30 minutes. So, <strong>it was FAST</strong> (even more than what I was expecting). LOL</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m OK with the final result. It&rsquo;s far from being my best presentation but it&rsquo;s
the first one in a different language, so it&rsquo;s acceptable.</p>
<p>They already published the video for my presentation, and it
is <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2017/K.4.401/">available here</a> as
<strong>desktops_open_source_behind_web_request</strong>.</p>

<p>FOSDEM was great, can&rsquo;t wait for the next! :)</p>

<a href="https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-desconstruindo-web">Casa do Código</a>.</p>
<p>Eu sou meio maluco (retardado, segundo o
<a href="https://twitter.com/georgeguimaraes">George Guimarães</a>) por produtividade e
organização pessoal e resolvi escrever sobre como foi o processo e mostrar todas
as métricas que eu coletei.</p>
<h3 id="como-começou">Como começou</h3>
<p>Há muito tempo atrás, por volta de 2010, eu participei do
<a href="http://devinsampa.com.br/">DevInSampa</a>. Esse era um evento muito legal que não
era focado em uma tecnologia específica e tinha como única finalidade trazer
vários assuntos legais da área de desenvolvimento.</p>
<p>Nessa época, eu pensei em fazer uma palestra que mostrasse tudo que está
acontecendo no computador enquanto você acessa uma aplicação. Quando comecei a
fazer um documento sobre isso, percebi que eu teria <strong>muito</strong> trabalho pela
frente e comecei a procrastinação. Fiquei bastante tempo nesse estado&hellip; Demorei
tanto que o DevInSampa morreu no meio do caminho. :(</p>
<p>A procrastinação durou até o meio do ano de 2015, quando o
<a href="https://twitter.com/brunoadacosta">Bruno Costa</a> me chamou para
palestrar no <a href="http://www.devinsantos.com.br/">DevInSantos</a>! Até o nome
do evento era parecido, era uma segunda chance para fazer a palestra
perdida.</p>
<p>Após aceitar o convite e dar um tema aleatório, eu comecei a fazer as pesquisas
sobre o que eu poderia falar. Essa pesquisa me levou a conclusão que mostrar
tudo que acontece em uma requisição web seria uma boa ideia. Depois de pensar um
pouco, o melhor tema que eu consegui foi &ldquo;<strong>Desconstruindo a web</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Depois de algumas semanas fazendo os slides e pouco mais de 40 horas de
pesquisa, eu finalmente terminei os slides da apresentação. Ao terminar, percebi
que havia muito conteúdo para uma palestra de 50 minutos. Eu que sempre preferi
que as palestras tivessem apenas 30 minutos, agora estava reclamando que o tempo
não era o suficiente para o conteúdo. Isso me fez pensar que talvez essa não
fosse a mídia correta para expor todo esse conteúdo.</p>
<p>Fiz a palestra e a recepção foi boa, mesmo com a velocidade alta que eu tive que
falar para terminar a palestra a tempo. Apesar disso, saí do evento convicto que
eu precisava de outra mídia para passar tudo que eu tinha estudado. E foi aí que
uma velha ideia voltou para a minha cabeça: &ldquo;E se eu escrever um livro?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-ideia">A ideia</h3>
<p>Escrever um livro é um objetivo de vida para mim, portanto eu sempre estava
pensando em como atingi-lo. Uma das ideias era escrever um livro de fantasia
usando <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing">self-publishing</a> em algum
momento da vida, mas depois de ver a quantidade de conteúdo que a palestra
gerou, surgiram algumas ideias. O conteúdo já estava estruturado e eu já tinha
ideia de quase tudo que queria mostrar, bastava colocar em palavras e imagens.</p>
<p>Consegui entrar em contato com o
<a href="https://twitter.com/adrianoalmeida7">Adriano Almeida</a> da casa do código por
indicação do meu amigo <a href="https://twitter.com/vinibaggio">Vinicius Baggio</a> e
apresentei o material que eu já tinha e as ideias para o que ele poderia
ser. Ele gostou do material e me passou as condições para continuar o trabalho.</p>
<h3 id="a-preparação">A preparação</h3>
<p>Nessa época eu estava começando a trabalhar em um projeto freelancer para uma
empresa de fora do Brasil, além do meu trabalho em tempo integral para a
<a href="http://locaweb.com.br">Locaweb</a>. Eu precisaria organizar o meu tempo para
trabalhar no livro, além de manter essas atividades.</p>
<p>O único tempo que eu tinha eram algumas horas durante o fim de semana. Com isso,
para trabalhar nesse projeto eu precisaria alinhar com a minha esposa e saber se
ela estava comigo nesse meu novo projeto. Depois de combinar com as partes
envolvidas e fazer o meu planejamento, era hora de começar!</p>
<h3 id="o-processo-de-escrita">O processo de escrita</h3>
<p>Comecei a trabalhar no livro logo no começo do ano, sendo que a
primeira versão do prefácio foi escrita no dia <strong>9 de Janeiro</strong>. Eu
mantive uma planilha no <a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> para
contabilizar todas as horas que eu trabalhasse nele. Lá eu também
registrei o que eu estava fazendo durante as horas que eu estava
trabalhando.</p>
<p>A planilha era uma forma bem simples de eu guardar um log do que eu
estava fazendo. Simples assim:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/escrevendo-o-desconstruindo-a-web/planilha.png" alt="Planilha simples de controle de horas"></p>
<p>O último dia de trabalho registrado na planilha é <strong>14 de Agosto de 2016</strong>, que
é o dia que eu considero terminados todos os trabalhos relacionados ao livro.</p>
<p>Por ter essa planilha, eu consigo fazer alguns gráficos interessantes. A partir
de agora, vou utilizar os dados que eu extraí de lá para mostrar mais sobre o
processo de escrita.</p>
<h4 id="dias-trabalhados">Dias trabalhados</h4>
<p><img src="/images/posts/escrevendo-o-desconstruindo-a-web/quando-trabalhei-mais.png" alt="Quando trabalhei mais"></p>
<p>A maior parte do tempo que eu escrevi foi nos finais de semana, que
somam 50% do trabalho no livro. Minha ideia era trabalhar cerca de 3
horas consecutivas no livro. Essa quantidade de horas é o máximo que
eu consigo trabalhar em total concentração.</p>
<p>Eu sempre busquei ambientes livres de distração, mas depois de ler o
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work</a> (que eu
recomendo para todos!) eu melhorei ainda mais a minha forma de trabalhar.</p>
<p>Sempre que começava a trabalhar, eu avisava a minha esposa que eu ficaria
incomunicável por algumas horas. Durante as próximas 2-3 horas, não haiva
comunicador, e-mail, celular ou qualquer outra coisa que pudesse tirar a minha
atenção.</p>
<p>Eu tenho uma <em>playlist</em> no <a href="https://play.google.com/music">Google Music</a> só com
músicas que me ajudam na concentração. Quando não estava usando essa <em>playlist</em>,
eu usava apenas barulho de chuva com o site
<a href="http://rain.today/">rain.today</a>. Quem me conhece sabe que eu não sou de comprar
fones de ouvido caros, portanto eu tenho um fone vagabundo e uso sons desse tipo
para me isolar do ambiente.</p>
<h4 id="horários-que-eu-trabalhava">Horários que eu trabalhava</h4>
<p><img src="/images/posts/escrevendo-o-desconstruindo-a-web/horario-de-trabalho.png" alt="Horário de trabalho"></p>
<p>O horário que eu mais iniciei foi as 18 horas. Geralmente aos domingos, era o
momento que eu já tinha aproveitado uma boa parte do dia com a minha esposa e
trabalhava até começar o episódio de Game of Thrones na HBO. :D</p>
<p>Mas tem início em quase todas as horas do dia.</p>
<h4 id="horas-por-dia">Horas por dia</h4>
<p><img src="/images/posts/escrevendo-o-desconstruindo-a-web/horas-por-dia.png" alt="Horas por dia"></p>
<p>Esse gráfico foi um pouco assustador para mim. Durante o feriado de Corpus
Christi, que aconteceu no dia 26 de Maio, eu estava sozinho em casa e aproveitei
para trabalhar no livro. Em um dos dias desse &ldquo;feriado prolongado&rdquo; eu trabalhei
12 horas no livro, que está representado como aquele ponto entre 26 de Maio e 12
de Junho.</p>
<p>Durante essas datas, eu só sai de casa umas 2 vezes para comprar comida, o resto
do tempo foi pesquisando e escrevendo. Eu não tinha nenhum deadline, apenas a
vontade de pesquisar e escrever. Isso me fez pensar que eu tenho sorte de ser
casado, porque senão eu seria mais maluco que o normal.</p>
<h4 id="horas-por-mês">Horas por mês</h4>
<p><img src="/images/posts/escrevendo-o-desconstruindo-a-web/horas-por-mes.png" alt="Horas por mês"></p>
<p>Eu estava bem curioso para saber como foi a distribuição de horas durante os
meses. Como eu esperava, o mês de Julho tem uma grande quantidade de horas. Isso
aconteceu porque eu decidi mandar para a Rubyconf a palestra que inspirou o
livro, e ela foi aceita. Esse fato colocou um <em>deadline</em> no livro. :)</p>
<p>Após conversar com a <a href="https://casadocodigo.com.br">Casa do código</a>, combinamos
que eu precisaria entregar o conteúdo até o dia <strong>7 de Agosto</strong> para que o livro
ficasse pronto a tempo da conferência.</p>
<p>Durante os fins de semana do mês de Julho eu trabalhei cerca de 14 horas por fim
de semana escrevendo. Apesar de ser um pouco cansativo, eu estava bem feliz por
estar trabalhando no projeto e não me desgastei muito.</p>
<p>Como o prazo era relativamente apertado, eu decidi tirar horas na semana para
fazer isso também. Com essa escolha, eu precisei negociar umas &ldquo;férias&rdquo; do
projeto que trabalho como freelancer e que toma cerca de 2-3 horas diárias do
meu tempo.</p>
<h4 id="o-que-compõe-a-escrita-de-um-livro">O que compõe a escrita de um livro</h4>
<p>Eu sempre tive curiosidade da quantidade de tempo que um escritor gasta nas
atividades de escrever um livro e me usei como cobaia para entender um pouco.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/escrevendo-o-desconstruindo-a-web/atividades.png" alt="Atividades"></p>
<p>Escrever é só uma das atividades de um escritor, assim como digitar é só uma das
atividades de um programador. Apenas <strong>42%</strong> do tempo foi gasto organizando as
palavras e escrevendo da melhor maneira possível.</p>
<p>O tempo de pesquisa está bem ligado com o tempo de escrita, consumindo <strong>12%</strong>
do tempo total. Infelizmente eu não separei exatamente a quantidade de horas que
eu gastei com pesquisa, portanto, é possível que parte do tempo considerado como
escrita também seja pesquisa. Eu aprendi muito no processo! :)</p>
<p>Eu decidi fazer todos os desenhos, o que tomou <strong>7%</strong> do tempo. Eu não sou muito
bom com desenho, mas fiquei contente com o resultado final. Eu utilizei muito
<a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> e um pouco de <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
para trabalhar com as imagens do livro. Para a imagem do &ldquo;mapa&rdquo;, que é meio
&ldquo;quem é esse Pokémon?&rdquo;, eu criei um script Python que usa
<a href="https://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> e <code>rsvg</code> para manipular os gráficos
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> do Inkscape e
gerar as imagens na sequência que eu esperava.</p>
<p>Era importante criar um site para o livro, pois todo o estudo é baseado em uma
URL. Por esse motivo eu gastei <strong>6%</strong> do tempo na criação dessa página. Não foi
um processo complicado, mas eu queria que ficasse exatamente como eu esperava.</p>
<p>Outra dúvida que eu tinha era sobre a reescrita de conteúdo e eu descobri que os
primeiros capítulos geralmente são reescritos. Utilizei <strong>6%</strong> do meu tempo para
reescrever os primeiros capítulos, que já não pareciam com a continuação do
livro. Só é preciso saber a hora de parar, senão fica igual refactoring infinito
de código.</p>
<p>Revisão é uma parte importante do processo e consumiu <strong>25%</strong> do tempo total. Eu
chamei 4 revisores técnicos competentes para me ajudar no processo (obrigado
novamente <a href="http://milhouseonsoftware.com/">Milhouse</a>,
<a href="https://www.broota.com.br/quem-somos">Daniel Sousa</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/mateuslinhares">Mateus Linhares</a> e
<a href="https://twitter.com/vinibaggio">Vinibaggio</a>) que sempre me davam suas opiniões
sinceras sobre o conteúdo. Além disso eu contei também com uma revisora da casa
do código, que acompanhou a escrita de cada capítulo e me dava dicas sobre a
escrita e didática.</p>
<p>Eu resolvi pegar uma semana de férias antes da entrega do livro para trabalhar
nele em tempo integral. Ele já estava completo e durante essa uma semana eu
trabalhei em revisão. Essa revisão não era igual as que foram feitas durante o
processo de escrita e sim uma revisão geral para ver se o conteúdo não estava
duplicado entre os capítulos e se estava sendo mostrado de uma forma coesa.</p>
<h3 id="a-entrega">A entrega</h3>
<p>Eu mantive o livro em segredo durante todo o processo de escrita. Apenas um
grupo seleto de pessoas sabiam que eu estava escrevendo, para evitar
expectativas. Minha meta era publicar o livro na Rubyconf no dia 23 de Setembro,
no final da minha palestra.</p>
<p>A casa do código colocou no site deles no começo do mês, mas não divulgaram em
nenhum lugar. Alguns amigos descobriram e eu pedi para não divulgarem por
enquanto. Ver o livro no site deles e não divulgar foi algo bem difícil, mas eu
consegui me conter até o dia 23.</p>
<p>Depois da minha palestra eu mostrei o livro e foi uma sensação fantástica
mostrar para todos os amigos um trabalho que eu tanto me orgulho. Foram <strong>315
horas</strong> e <strong>8 meses</strong> de trabalho que valeram a pena.</p>
<h3 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h3>
<p>Não escrevi esse livro com a finalidade de ganhar dinheiro. A primeira dica que
um amigo me deu quando eu disse que ia escrever foi: &ldquo;Você sabe que
financeiramente não compensa, né?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>É sempre bom ter uma segunda renda para remunerar essas 315 horas investidas,
mas não foi o principal motivador da minha escrita. Pode parecer bobo, mas eu
escrevi esse livro por que eu <strong>realmente acredito</strong> que ele vai ser útil para
as pessoas.</p>
<p>Esse é o primeiro livro e provavelmente não será o último&hellip; Que venham os
próximos! :)</p>

            <description>TL;DR: A melhor Rubyconf que eu participei
Nos dias 24 e 25 de Setembro de 2016 aconteceu a Rubyconf Brasil. Assim como eu fiz um post sobre o primeiro Rails Summit que o Akita participou da organização, resolvi também fazer um post sobre a última rubyconf que ele resolveu organizar.
Essa Rubyconf teve vários pontos especialmente importantes para mim. O primeiro deles foi logo no início quando o Gilberto Mautner, que é um dos fundadores da Locaweb, mencionou os números do projeto que eu estou trabalhando por lá.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: A melhor Rubyconf que eu participei</p>
<p>Nos dias 24 e 25 de Setembro de 2016 aconteceu a Rubyconf Brasil.
Assim como eu
<a href="http://pothix.com/2008/10/21/rails-summit-latin-america.html">fiz um post sobre o primeiro Rails Summit que o Akita participou da organização</a>,
resolvi também fazer um post sobre a última rubyconf que ele resolveu
organizar.</p>
<p>Essa Rubyconf teve vários pontos especialmente importantes para mim. O
<strong>primeiro deles</strong> foi logo no início quando o Gilberto Mautner, que é um
dos fundadores da Locaweb, mencionou os números do projeto que eu
estou trabalhando por lá.</p>
<p>Atualmente estou trabalhando em um projeto para melhorar o tempo de
entrega das equipes de desenvolvimento. Para que esse projeto seja bem
sucedido, nós precisamos rever vários processos e arquitetura de
aplicações. O fato dele ser mostrado na introdução da conferência por
ser um projeto legal já diz muito sobre o nosso trabalho.</p>
<p>O <strong>segundo ponto foi a minha palestra</strong>, que aconteceu no primeiro
dia as 15:45 no andar aberto (os slides estão
<a href="http://cege.la/nzhl40">aqui</a>). Para essa palestra eu estava mais
nervoso do que normalmente fico, porque sabia que eu teria que falar
bem rápido se quisesse passar todo o conteúdo no tempo que eu
tinha. Além disso, essa não era uma palestra normal! Eu fiz o
lançamento do
<a href="https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br/?source=pothix.com">meu livro</a> no
fim.</p>
<p>E esse foi o <strong>terceiro ponto</strong> importante dessa conferência. O livro
estava
<a href="https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-desconstruindo-web">disponível no site da casa do código</a>
desde o começo do mês, mas eu estava aguardando essa oportunidade para
divulgar. Foi um mês de expectativa para finalmente mostrar um
trabalho que eu me orgulho muito.</p>
<p>O <strong>quarto</strong> e último ponto que tornou essa conferência especial foi
ser citado no fechamendo. Essa vai ser a última Rubyconf organizada
pelo <a href="https://twitter.com/akitaonrails">Fabio Akita</a>. No fechamento da
conferência ele mostrou um review dos últimos 10 anos de organização
de eventos de Ruby e agradeceu as pessoas que estavam participando
desde o começo. Pode parecer bobeira, mas ter seu nome (ou nickname)
citado no final de uma conferência com 1200 pessoas é muito
gratificante. Eu já sou totalmente a favor dos planos do Akita e já
tinha comentado com ele sobre isso há algum tempo atrás. E ele
realmente merece um auditório inteiro de pé aplaudindo seu trabalho
durante esses 10 anos.</p>
<p>Tudo isso fora os velhos amigos que eu pude rever, pessoas novas que
eu conheci e coisas que eu aprendi. Algumas pessoas eu conversei e não
sabiam que eram as pessoas que eu falava pela internet há muito tempo,
só vim perceber depois. Durante esses vários anos de Rubyconf, eu tive
o prazer de conversar pessoalmente com 2 core commiters do Ruby, e
isso não é uma coisa que temos a chance de fazer com frequência. :)</p>
<p>Esse é o espírito da Rubyconf, juntar desenvolvedores que gostam de
programar para trocar ideias. Eu considero essa conferência como uma
versão grande do que é o <a href="https://gurusp.org">Guru-SP</a>.</p>
<p>Não sei como vai ser o futuro de conferências como essa. A Locaweb
<a href="https://twitter.com/locaweb/status/779819447087403008">diz que a Rubyconf continua</a>,
mas ainda não temos ideia sobre as novidades. Independente do que está
por vir, tenho certeza que esse espirito de camaradagem e busca
contínua de conhecimento vai continuar. :)</p>

            <title>Ouvir livros (audiobooks), o futuro da leitura</title>

            <description>TL;DR: Ouvir livros é o futuro.
Atualização de 18/06/2016: Adicionando o audiobooks.com.
Quem me conhece sabe que há muito tempo eu ouço podcasts sempre que eu posso, principalmente no caminho entre a minha casa e o trabalho. No fim do ano de 2015 eu vi a quantidade de livros que o Rafael Rosa leu e fiquei abismado. Ele leu mais de 90 livros em um ano! Tudo bem que ele estava em um período sabático, mas mesmo assim ainda é uma quantidade bem absurda de livros para se ler em um ano.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Ouvir livros é o futuro.</p>
<p><strong>Atualização de 18/06/2016</strong>: Adicionando o <a href="https://www.audiobooks.com/">audiobooks.com</a>.</p>
<p>Quem me conhece sabe que há muito tempo eu ouço podcasts sempre que eu
posso, principalmente no caminho entre a minha casa e o trabalho. No
fim do ano de 2015 eu vi a quantidade de livros que o
<a href="https://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu">Rafael Rosa</a> leu e fiquei
abismado. Ele leu mais de 90 livros em um ano! Tudo bem que ele estava
em um período sabático, mas mesmo assim ainda é uma quantidade bem
absurda de livros para se ler em um ano.</p>
<p>Ao conversar melhor o Rafael, descobri que boa parte desses livros
foram lidos via Audiobooks. Ele, assim como eu, sempre foi adepto de
podcasts, mas há um tempo decidiu trocar por audiobooks e falou que
estava indo muito bem assim.</p>
<p>Eu decidi então que iria tentar um audiolivro em breve para ver se me
adaptava. Lembrei que em poucos dias eu teria que fazer um mapeamento
de retina, o que me deixaria a pupila dilatada durante quase todo o
dia, me deixando sem a possibilidade de fazer muita coisa. Isso se
mostrou ser o momento perfeito para testar audiobooks!</p>
<p>Resolvi começar com um livro bem antigo chamado: &ldquo;A arte da
guerra&rdquo;. Deixei tudo preparado no meu celular e em uma tarde o livro
estava totalmente lido. O livro é pequeno, mas troquei uma tarde
perdida por um livro lido!</p>
<p>Resolvi então começar uma <em>quest</em> para ler mais livros. Para isso eu
precisava de um processo simples e justo de ouvir, portanto testei
várias apps. Vou descrever abaixo os meus testes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://audible.com">Audible</a> &ndash; É de longe o melhor serviço que tem para
audiobooks. Tem uma biblioteca bem extensa para livros, possui aceleração de
audio, a compra e download de audiobooks é bem simples e o site é bem fácil de
usar. Um dos problemas é que a grande maioria do livros estão em inglês. Há
alguns livros em português, mas somente os livros muito clássicos como &ldquo;Dom
casmurro&rdquo; por exemplo. No audible, para que você consiga <strong>1</strong> audiobook por
mês você paga <strong>$15</strong>, o que dá quase R$70 para nós no brasil, o que é um
valor meio salgado IMO.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.audiobooks.com/">audiobooks.com</a> &ndash; Uma tentativa de
concorrer com o Audible, mas com o mesmo preço e uma qualidade de
aplicativo bem inferior. A parte boa é que você pode fazer o trial
de 30 dias e ouvir um livro de graça, em último caso, caso você não
goste, pelo menos ouviu um livro.</li>
<li><a href="https://scribd.com">Scribd</a> &ndash; Está entrando agora na área de audiobooks. A
compra de livros e download do audio foi bem fácil e o serviço possui tanto
livros como audiobooks. O <em>player</em> ainda não possui a funcionalidade de
acelerar o audio, o que para mim o torna quase inutilizável. O serviço não tem
uma biblioteca tão vasta como a do Audible, mas possui vários livros legais. O
valor é quase metade do valor do Audible e pode ser uma alternativa assim que
implementarem a aceleração de audio.</li>
<li><a href="http://tocalivros.com">Tocalivros</a> &ndash; É a alternativa brasileira de
distribuição e criação de audiobooks. O player deles melhorou muito nos
últimos meses e está quase chegando lá. Infelizmente a quantidade de títulos
bons ainda é bem baixa e nem se compara com serviços gringos ainda.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ubook.com/">Ubook</a> &ndash; Esse eu não cheguei a testar para formar uma
opinião, mas resolvi colocar aqui como mais um site brasileiro de
audiobooks. A quantidade de títulos também é bem precária, no mesmo esquema do
tocalivros.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quando o livro que eu estou lendo não tem narração humana eu vou para a versão
sintetizada. Tem gente que abomina a narração sintetizada, mas para mim não é um
grande problema, desde que eu consiga entender o conteúdo.</p>
<p>Para quem não conhece, a narração sintetizada é quando você coloca uma voz
sintetizada como a do Google Translate para ler um livro para você. Essa ideia é
muito utilizada por pessoas com deficiência visual, pois não podem depender de
alguém narrando para eles todo o conteúdo e fazem a maquina narrar.</p>
<p>O que eu uso para narração sintetizada:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperionics.avar">@Voice</a>
&ndash; De todos que eu testei esse foi o que eu mais gostei. O esquema de voz é
aceitável e é fácil de ajustar a velocidade. Ele também integra com o
<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> caso você queira ouvir os seus artigos.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.livrariasaraiva.ereader.andr2&amp;hl=pt-br">Lev Saraiva</a>
&ndash; O Lev é o leitor da Saraiva e suporta narração sintetizada. A parte boa
dele é que você pode comprar os livros direto na Saraiva e integrar com
ele. Na teoria é uma ótima ideia mas na prática não funcionou muito bem para
mim.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="http://www.fundacaodorina.org.br/">fundação Dorina nowill</a> para cegos tem
vários audiobooks narrados, mas só tem acesso os deficientes visuais que fizerem
um cadastro bem extenso e pelo que eu li eles recebem um CD com o audio. Existe
uma lei que quem tem deficiência visual não precisa pagar por esse tipo de
conteúdo e a fundação pode disponibilizar gratuitamente, mas pelo visto eles
fazem um controle legal para manter o copyright e etc.</p>
<p>Obviamente, boa parte desse conteúdo está aberto na internet em blogs que acham
e disponibilizam, portanto não é muito difícil de encontrar. Caso você siga por
esse caminho, seja um bom samaritano e compre os livros para remunerar o autor
que gastou centenas de horas da vida dele para escrever o livro que você está
lendo&hellip; É o que eu faço com os livros que eu ouço dessa maneira, alguns eu até
dou de presente.</p>
<p>Não é todo livro que é legal de se ouvir, alguns são densos demais para que você
consiga compreender bem apenas ouvindo continuamente, mas a grande maioria das
ficções é bem agradável de ouvir. Eu tinha colocado uma meta de 10 livros para
esse ano, e <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-pothix">meu goodreads</a>
nesse momento está mostrando que eu já li <strong>22</strong>!</p>
<p>Fica aí a dica para quem, como eu, ficava reclamando que não conseguia ler os
livros que queria! :)</p>

            <description>TL;DR: I like Colemak, and it is a very good layout. I found some equivalent pros and cons, so I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to anyone without a little bit of philosophy. :)
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Colemak, it is a keyboard layout created to make the most used keys stay in the home row as well as make you swipe between your right and left hand.
There is a keyboard layouts heatmap for you to understand the benefits of using a keyboard layout that was designed to help you to be comfortable and fast when typing instead of one that helping the operator to not jam the typewriter.</description>

I tried some code (python), English and Portuguese texts and it looks almost the

<p>I&rsquo;m using Colemak since Dec, 25 of 2013 and here come the pros and cons that I

<p>The first con is that I don&rsquo;t know how to type fast on Qwerty anymore, now I&rsquo;m
typing as I never saw a Qwerty layout before. The problem is that everyone uses
this crappy layout and sometimes you need to use it to write and it makes you
look like a grandpa. The good part is that I almost don&rsquo;t need to use Qwerty, all
devices that belong to me I&rsquo;ve changed to Colemak (computers, cellphones and so
on), so I just need to use Qwerty when I&rsquo;m typing on other peoples devices.</p>
<p>A pro is that my typing speed grew from an average of 75 WPM to almost 100
WPM. I need to consider that I also bought a Kinesis Advantage Pro;</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/almost-two-years-using-colemak-kinesis.jpg" alt="Kinesis advantage photo" title="Kinesis Advantage"></p>
<p>Without this keyboard, I&rsquo;m not that fast. Just tried
<a href="http://10fastfingers.com/user/504663/">10fastfingers now and got 92 WPM</a> using
my laptop&rsquo;s keyboard.</p>
<p>Another pro is that I really feel comfortable using Colemak, you the same way as
being an experienced Vim user, looks like you don&rsquo;t need to type so much. :)</p>
<p>Now, talking about Vim&hellip; I&rsquo;m an experienced Vim user, but Vim is totally
coupled with the Qwerty layout. I tried to remap some keys (like hjkl for example)
in order to keep using the home row to navigate but it was not very good. Today
I&rsquo;m just using the plain Colemak layout on Vim and it is not so good as it was on
Qwerty. For this reason, I decided to try a new editor and I&rsquo;m using Emacs
now. :)</p>
<p>It took me at least a month to get back to my old typing speed, I was training
every day on 10fastfinges to get used to the layout. In the beginning, you may
feed some headaches because of the mind remapping. It&rsquo;s not so easy to change
something that you thought was the only way of getting things done. It was a
great challenge for me and it just seems right, I don&rsquo;t wanna use a keyboard
layout that was made to avoid jams on a typewriter, Jesus, we&rsquo;re in 2015 and
there are no typewriters anymore.</p>
<p>Hope this post helps a lot of Colemak newcomers and the only thing I could say
about my journey is that <strong>I would do it again if I could</strong>. :)</p>

            <description>TL;DR I&amp;rsquo;ve been at OSCON this year (thanks to Locaweb) and this post will summarize my impressions about the conference. I spoke at Locaweb Tech-Talks about it and you can find my slides here (in portuguese).
OSCON (Open Source Conference) is one of the most important open source conferences of our time and happened in Portland this year as usual. Portland is a great city, the one I liked the most until now, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have high car traffic, MAX (the train) took us for most of the places we wanted to know, nice people all over the place, great convention center and a lot of other benefits.</description>

<p><a href="http://oscon.com">OSCON (Open Source Conference)</a> is one of the most
important open source conferences of our time and happened in Portland
this year as usual.  Portland is a great city, the one I liked the
most until now, it doesn&rsquo;t have high car traffic, MAX (the train) took
us for most of the places we wanted to know, nice people all over the
place, great convention center and a lot of other benefits.</p>
<h3 id="july-20">July, 20</h3>
<p>The conference started at 9:00 am of July 20, 2015 with the first day of
tutorials. In the first day I followed the <strong>Kubernetes tutorial</strong> and it was cool.
I had the chance to talk with Google guys about it and try Google
Computing Engine, which was very nice.</p>
<h3 id="july-21">July, 21</h3>
<p>The second day was filled with more tutorials and I chose RUST and Cassandra.</p>
<h4 id="rust">RUST</h4>
<p>Was a good tutorial with a lot of exercises and good tips of the
language. I really liked it and I&rsquo;ll probably give
<a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> a try on the next months.</p>
<h4 id="cassandra">Cassandra</h4>
<p>I was expecting a different thing from this one. It was based on how
to use <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">cassandra</a>, create tables and so
on and I was expecting tips on how to create and scale it and maybe a
little bit about the caveats we may found on the way. But it wasn&rsquo;t
bad at all, I&rsquo;ve learned a little bit on how to use it and as a gift I
tried a little bit of spark as well.</p>
<p>At the end of this day the Expo hall opened for everyone, cool things there
(including some T-shirts&hellip; T-shirts everywhere).</p>
<h3 id="july-22">July, 22</h3>
<p>Let the conference begin! :)</p>
<p>It started with the keynotes at 9:00 and I would like to highlight one of them.
All keynotes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL055Epbe6d5YhDchEvY3O4nIuSLYyrx7K">are avaiable on
youtube</a>
btw. :)</p>
<h4 id="facebook-open-source-at-scale-keynote">Facebook open source at scale (Keynote)</h4>
<p>I like to understand the open source culture behind these big
companies. It is really interesting to know that there are only <em>2</em>
people to handle all the facebook open source process shocked me a
litte bit. They have a great open source review and publishing process
and all the softwares they release are running in their production
environment. So, why do they do open source software? Because it&rsquo;s
good for the company, helps them to make better software and bring
smart people to work with them.</p>
<p>And then the multiple sessions started, a lot of great subjects in the agenda
and you have to choose one (!!!).</p>
<h4 id="roller-coaster-tycoon-with-genetic-algorithms-and-go">Roller Coaster Tycoon with genetic algorithms and Go</h4>
<p>The speaker
<a href="https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/roller-coaster-tycoon-genetic-algorithms/">Kevin Burke</a>
spoke about his hobbie of playing with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon">roller coaster tycoon</a>
game maps with Go and Genetic Algorithms in order to create de best
roller coaster ever! It is not there already but the presention was
really cool to follow.</p>
<h4 id="you-type-googlecom-into-your-browser-bar-and-press-enter-what-happens-next">You type &ldquo;google.com&rdquo; into your browser bar and press enter: What happens next?&quot;</h4>
<p>The speaker for this talk is
<a href="https://twitter.com/mathie">Graeme Mathieson</a>. I was planning to
spoke about it before de last edition of
<a href="http://devinsampa.com.br/">DevInSampa</a> (2012? Btw, it could happen
again&hellip;) but didn&rsquo;t had the guts to make it yet and there it is,
someone made it before me. The pace of the presentation was not good
but the content was cool (it was his first presentation). At least it
made me think more about this topic and <em>maybe</em> I&rsquo;ll try to speak
about it soon.</p>
<p>After the lunch I tried to attend to <strong>Evolution of information
security threats</strong> presentation but the room was full, so decided to
go to <a href="http://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> guys presentation.</p>
<h4 id="fixing-the-fragmentation-problem-for-real-time-communications">Fixing the fragmentation problem for real-time communications</h4>
<p>Matrix&rsquo;s is really interesting, the main idea is to make a
protocol for messages, just like the email protocols do for our
email, we may use our client and store our own email but it is not
possible with today&rsquo;s messaging like hangouts, whatsapp, telegram,
skype and so on. They had a live demo piloting a quadricopter via
chat, it was really cool.</p>
<h4 id="high-adventures-in-sniffing-my-own-metadata">High adventures in sniffing my own metadata</h4>
<p>The speaker is <a href="http://matrix.org/">Josh Deprez</a> from Google
Australia. He described his work using a Go program (home made) to
analize his own internet traffic and which information he got on
it. The presentation itself was cool to follow but the discoveries
wasn&rsquo;t so much interesting. :P</p>
<h4 id="building-the-9-computer-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-embedded-linux">Building the $9 computer, or how I learned to stop worrying and love embedded Linux</h4>
<p>This is the
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer">C.H.I.P project</a>
owner <strong>Dave Rauchwerk</strong> speaking about the story behind the
project. This guy is hilarious and a real hacker, he made a gif camera
just for the lulz and tried a product with it!  Unfortunately it was
too expensive, to be viable for selling, so he decided to create
C.H.I.P to make the camera cheaper and C.H.I.P became the product by
itself.</p>
<h4 id="continuous-delivery-and-large-microservice-architectures-reflections-on-ioncannon">Continuous delivery and large microservice architectures: Reflections on Ioncannon</h4>
<p>This last one was really interesting <strong>Kevin Scaldeferri</strong> from
<a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a> spoke about how they grown from a big
and monolythic Rails application to 250 microservices. In short, it
was a mess in the beginning, a lot of techlologies and deploy tools
until they organized and found a standard for the language and deploy
tools, it is really better now, but the old Rails app is still there.</p>
<h3 id="july-23">July, 23</h3>
<p>A new day with an typical American breakfast at Denny&rsquo;s and starting
with keynotes at 9:00 AM again.</p>
<h4 id="making-architecture-matter-keynote">Making architecture matter (Keynote)</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> spoke about architecture
in general, there was some good quotes. One of the arguments that
really make sense is that the today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Architect&rdquo; is that guy that
don&rsquo;t write code (!?). How can a professional that doesn&rsquo;t write code
talk about how to write code? Another good point was about the user
perspective about architecture it can&rsquo;t see it anywhere but still need
to pay for it! We need to argue using economic principles in order to
be able to create a good architecture for our softwares because
economics always win.</p>
<p>We have a lot of examples of products that were the market leader for their
segment and it could not evolve anymore to the point that it was swallowed by
another competitor. This is a sign of bad architecture.</p>
<h4 id="you-code-like-a-sysadm">You code like a sysadm</h4>
<p>hm&hellip; This talk was not so good but it left a message for everyone:
&ldquo;Bad code is still better than no code at all&rdquo;</p>
<p>And obviously: Good code is better than bad code.</p>
<p>So, instead of not doing something because you think your code is not good
enough, do it and improve as soon as possible.</p>
<h4 id="when-performance-counts-c-in-the-21st-century">When Performance Counts: C++ in the 21st Century</h4>
<p>The speaker threw some good arguments that haven&rsquo;t came to my mind until this
day: &ldquo;Why is C++ getting more attention these days?&rdquo;, we have C++11 being
created and more people talking about it. In his words, the world was not in
need for performance anymore, we had big computers and most of time the other
languages (java, in his examples) are doing a good job to create what is needed
without the need to manage memory by hand. But today we have some other
hardwares that need this performance back, like tablets, mobile devices, cloud
applications that pays based on cpu time and so on. Good catch man! :)</p>
<h4 id="creating-an-open-source-office-lessons-from-twitter">Creating an open source office: Lessons from Twitter</h4>
<p>I made a bad choice based on the presentation title and changed rooms as fast as
I could to follow this one.</p>
<p>Some notes on the presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure projects have owners or give it to the community: this is the
twitter example of
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Twitter bootstrap</a></li>
<li>Always say Thank you for your project collaborators</li>
<li>Lessons from <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">mesos</a>
<ul>
<li>Apple uses mesos for Siri</li>
<li>Open source foundations force good pactices on you (incubated aurora)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lessons for <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twemcache">twencache</a>
<ul>
<li>Keep track with the upstream if you fork something</li>
<li>Share your code with some peers to gauge interest</li>
<li>open source project with collaborators is better</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A good lesson that I got from this presentation is that community
doesn&rsquo;t come for free. Companies like Twitter have their own community
managers, conference speakers, conference organizers, documentation
writers and their developers to make everyone engaged with the
project. Throw something on github and expect collaboration is not the
best idea for OSS.</p>
<p>Your employess may become open source celebrities sometimes, and if they became
popular they may leave the company. It is not so good for the company but the
same popular projects may attact new talents as well. :)</p>
<p>Troll&rsquo;s are everywhere and youy will always hear that your project is stupid and
useless. The best way to deal with it is to take it as a compliment because
people care enough to say it.</p>
<h4 id="mesos-the-os-for-your-datacenter">Mesos the OS for your datacenter</h4>
<p>David Greenberg from <a href="http://www.twosigma.com/">Two sigma</a> spoke about how they
built their own <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">mesos</a> framework.</p>
<p>Mesos has a high level API to do things and you don&rsquo;t need to care about the
resources. It provide an algorith called
<a href="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/drf.pdf">DRF</a> for a fair allocation of
resources.</p>
<p>There are several built frameworks for mesos like Marathon, Aurora, Jenkins and
some more. It&rsquo;s easy to build your own framework (netflix, twitter, apple and
two sigma have it). A good reason to build your own is to deal with some exotic
workload, this default frameworks are built for small tasks.</p>
<p>For me, mesos is the future and I&rsquo;ll definitely be looking for it.</p>
<h3 id="july-24">July, 24</h3>
<p>This was the last day of the conference and it started with 3 keynotes. After the
keynotes there was two sessions more and the conference ending at the main ballroom.</p>
<h4 id="hacking-conways-lay-keynote">Hacking Conway&rsquo;s Lay (Keynote)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>organizations which design systems &hellip; are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations
—M. Conway[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When rebuilding a system it&rsquo;s really important to think about your team because
it will be part of its architecture like conway&rsquo;s law says. So when a decision
is made to build a new system without changing the way people work you will face
the same problems the other system had but with a different code.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re using microservices but your team is still monolithic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To solve technical problems, you often have to go outside the technical domain.
Raffi Krikorian</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good points that ended the presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not all about the code!</li>
<li>Small teams can do big things.</li>
<li>Full stack teams keeps your architecture flexible.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t fight Conway&rsquo;s Law, work with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of good lessons learnt from this one. :)</p>
<h4 id="build-a-botnet">Build a botnet?</h4>
<p>The speaker (<a href="http://fossetcon.org">Bryan Smith</a>) did a great (and funny :P)
presentation around the topic. And some things are really scary when speaking
about botnets. The most scary thing for me was its price, you can use a botnet
for an hour spending only $5&hellip; it is really low and probably will get a service
out of business for that time. There are some softwares avalable if you want to
build your own botnet these days (accorting to Bryan, if you want to build a
botnet you&rsquo;re probably a scumbag&hellip; LOL), here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>citadel</li>
<li>kreios C2</li>
<li>Andromeda V2.6 - leaked</li>
<li>Kaiten IRC bot</li>
<li>SDBot - GPL</li>
<li>DSNX Bots</li>
<li>Q8 Bots</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll not post links here but you can google them if you really want it. :P</p>
<p>The most funny part of the presentation was its end when the speaker laptop got
rebooted when trying to bring the botnet up. LOL</p>
<h4 id="freedom-and-responsibility-netflix-centralized-team-in-a-decentralized-world">Freedom and responsibility @Netflix: Centralized team in a decentralized world</h4>
<p>One of the best presentations of the
conference. <a href="http://www.mikemcgarr.com/about.html">Mike McGarr</a> spoke
about his team (tools team) role at
<a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> and the hacker culture there.</p>
<p>One of the team roles is to increase the rate of innovation and reduce
the impact of change by providing good tools for the other teams. Their clients
are the other teams engineers, it&rsquo;s not a simple internal system it&rsquo;s a product!</p>
<p>Netflix has a
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">great culture</a> and each
team as a subset of this culture.</p>
<p>Netflix has a lot of good tools but the engineers may choose to not use it and
build their own in case it doesn&rsquo;t fix their problems. For this reason there are
4 deploy tools running on Netflix actually.</p>
<p>They have no Ops team, you build it, you support it! And in order to remove part
of the constant interruptions, the team uses a &ldquo;responder rotation&rdquo; when each
time (day, week, month?) a new engineer will be in charge of solving problems
and helping the other teams.</p>
<p>They (like many of us) don&rsquo;t like ticket systems, but they use it anyway (like
many of us?). For this case the tip is: Make creating a ticket easy, minimize
fraction by making it as easy and fast as possible.</p>
<p>Hackatons are made between the team in order to keep the innovation process
flowing and making space for innovation. Another good thing to think about is to
always hire beyond your needs, it makes more space for innovation (not all
people working on day to day tasks) and it will be really helpful when the
project is on fire and the team needs more intensity on it.</p>
<p>Communication is really important for the teams and they do not set a limitation
for important communications like framework versions and DC migrations. For this
task they use hipchat, email, banners and everything that may call the
engineers' attention.</p>
<h4 id="situation-normal-everything-must-change">Situation normal, everything must change</h4>
<p>This was the last keynote and maybe the best one, and I highly recommend you to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty6pOVEc3bA">watch it</a>.</p>
<p>Simon Wardley used the fact that OSCON is moving to speak about situation
awareness and what could happen when you&rsquo;re not prepared for a new thing.</p>
<p>His arguments are that we&rsquo;re using the wrong maps to try to understand our
problems. In business we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT</a>
for example, which is really bad to understand to understand the whole picture,
it was really funny to see his comparisons with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae">the battle of the 300</a>
using a SWAT map instead of land map. LOL</p>
<p>The speaker shows some maps he uses for his business, and it looks really better
than just a SWOT. :)</p>
<p>Again, I really recommend you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty6pOVEc3bA">watch this talk</a>. I liked it. :)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The best conference I ever attended. Everything was great: hotel, Portland
Conference Center, the city in general, the food, the conference content and so
on. It definitely worth the 14 hours plane travel to be there.</p>
<p>I would live in a city like Portland, it is one of the best cities I ever
visited. I&rsquo;m sad to know that the next OSCON will happen in Austin instead of
Portland. :(</p>

            <description>Welcome to the new blog layout of PotHix.com! :)
I decided that the time has came to change not just the layout but the blog engine as well. I&amp;rsquo;m now using middleman instead of wordpress. Just to be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t think wordpress is not good at all, but I want to publish static files instead of keeping the wordpress &amp;ldquo;infrastructure&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve divided into 3 feeds:
 Only english posts: http://feeds.</description>

            <description>Pode ser que eu seja meio burro (heheh) mas eu ainda achava que o Ruby e o Python usavam Green Threads, mas depois de conversar com uma galera me disseram que eram threads nativas. Pesquisando na internet eu vi que eram mesmo, mas decidi rodar um strace para ver elas rolando e postar sobre isso.
Fiz dois scripts simples:
Python
import threading import time for i in range(5): t = threading.</description>

Python usavam Green Threads, mas depois de conversar com uma galera me disseram

<p>Fiz dois scripts simples:</p>

<pre><code>import threading

<pre><code>require 'thread'
5.times do
  Thread.new {sleep 10}
end
sleep 1

<p>Rodando o script python com o comando <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strace -f -e clone,fork python thread.py<!-- raw HTML omitted --> retorna pouca coisa:</p>

<p>Alí no final dá para ver as 5 threads que eu pedi no script sendo abertas no
SO. Inclusive, se analizar todo esse retorno aí dá para ver que o Ruby criou 6
threads, uma delas o ruby cria mesmo se vc fizer só um <!-- raw HTML omitted -->puts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> num script. :)</p>
<p>Discutir sobre linguagens com os amigos sempre é legal para pesquisar e
descobrir coisas novas. :)</p>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Go last month and I really liked to work with the language.
The project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is dead simple and just retrieves metrics and save on a redis server (the data will be analyzed by a different project that I&amp;rsquo;m working on). So I have 15 goroutines retrieving data constantly and I&amp;rsquo;m using just two native threads.
I did some CPU profiling on the code using my current machine for Golang 1.</description>

<p>What an improvement! :)</p>
<p>I know that this application may not be the best example to compare Go with a
different language because it depends of a third application (that is my
bottleneck BTW) and Ruby perform as good as the new version but I really liked
to give Go a try.</p>
<p>Go language has a lot of interesting ideas and it is growing fast.
Looks like it is a good idea of language for some of my projects, welcome Golang!</p>

            <title>O Guru-SP e seus 5 anos de vida</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/gurusp5/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://pothix.com/posts/gurusp5/</guid>
            <description>Há pouco tempo aconteceu o encontro numero 31 do Guru-SP, e como sempre saímos (dessa vez estavamos @vinibaggio, @agaelebe, @nuxlli e @anderson_leite) para aquele velho momento de bate papo pós evento. Durante a conversa o @nuxlli perguntou sobre como o Guru-SP começou e nesse momento eu comecei a relembrar daquela velha tarde em 2008.
Mas peraí&amp;hellip; 2008!! O Guru-SP está próximo de fazer 5 anos de vida! :)
Em pensar que tudo começou após um post do @agaelebe na Rails-br falando sobre criar grupos locais para conversar mais sobre Ruby e fazer encontros com mais frequência, o que gerou interesse de várias pessoas de São Paulo, que decidiram levar esse &amp;ldquo;projeto&amp;rdquo; pra frente.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Há pouco tempo aconteceu o <a href="http://gurusp.org/encontros/trigesimo-primeiro-encontro-do-guru-sp">encontro numero 31 do Guru-SP</a>, e como sempre saímos
(dessa vez estavamos <a href="http://twitter.com/vinibaggio">@vinibaggio</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/agaelebe">@agaelebe</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nuxlli">@nuxlli</a> e <a href="http://twitter.com/anderson_leite">@anderson_leite</a>) para
aquele velho momento de bate papo pós evento. Durante a conversa o @nuxlli perguntou sobre como o Guru-SP começou e nesse momento eu comecei a relembrar
daquela velha tarde em 2008.</p>
<p>Mas peraí&hellip; <strong>2008</strong>!! O Guru-SP está próximo de fazer <strong>5 anos</strong> de vida! :)</p>
<p>Em pensar que tudo começou após <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rails-br/HUnABlEfR7A">um post do @agaelebe na
Rails-br</a> falando
sobre criar grupos locais para conversar mais sobre Ruby e fazer encontros com
mais frequência, o que gerou interesse de várias pessoas de São Paulo, que
decidiram levar esse &ldquo;projeto&rdquo; pra frente.</p>
<p>Logo em seguida o <a href="http://twitter.com/mfcastellani">@mfcastellani</a> já iniciou <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-sp/2SEBkbofoFA">as primeiras
discussões</a> no
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-sp">grupo do Guru-SP</a> e
aproveitamos para agendar o <a href="http://gurusp.org/encontros/primeiro-encontro">primeiro
encontro</a> numa churrascaria
qualquer no ABC que era mais próximo da casa do <a href="http://twitter.com/mfcastellani">@mfcastellani</a>, pois como ele nos
contou depois: &ldquo;Se não aparecer ninguém só comeria uma carne e voltaria para
casa&rdquo;. hahaha</p>
<p>E algumas pessoas compareceram, eramos 3 pessoas conversando sobre o que poderia
ser o Guru-SP no futuro. Não conhecia o <a href="http://twitter.com/mfcastellani">@mfcastellani</a> nem o <a href="http://twitter.com/agaelebe">@agaelebe</a>, mas
ficamos boa parte da tarde conversando sobre desenvolvimento no geral e
planejando o que seria legal fazer no grupo (camisetas, eventos maiores,
encontros mensais, e etc).</p>
<p>Logo conseguimos as camisetas do Guru-SP! Depois de cotar alguns fornecedores e
fazer um desenho legal para representar o grupo rachamos as despesas e mandamos
fazer camisetas para quem estivesse interessado. Com a entrega das camisetas
consegui conhecer muita gente que não conhecia pessoalmente.</p>
<p>Aproveitamos que alguns de nós estariam na Campus Party e fizemos o segundo
encontro por lá! Como sempre tinha uma quantidade enorme de pessoas: Eu, o
<a href="http://twitter.com/mfcastellani">@mfcastellani</a> e o <a href="http://twitter.com/akitaonrails">@akitaonrails</a>. O <a href="http://twitter.com/shadowmaru">@shadowmaru</a> apareceu também, mas só me
encontrou para pegar a camiseta.</p>
<p>Nesse meio tempo já estávamos planejando aquele &ldquo;encontro maior&rdquo; que conversamos
no primeiro encontro, e poucos meses depois saiu o <a href="http://gurusp.org/encontros/ruby-rails-no-mundo-real-primeira-edicao">Ruby + Rails no mundo
real</a> com
o auxílio da Tempo Real eventos.</p>
<p>Apesar do quarto ter uma quantidade pequena de pessoas (apenas o <a href="http://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu">@rafaelrosafu</a> e
o <a href="http://twitter.com/agaelebe">@agaelebe</a>), o quinto encontro me surpreendeu bastante. Ao chegar na Voice
Technology (onde o <a href="http://twitter.com/andre_pantaliao">@andre_pantaliao</a> trabalhava na época e conseguiu o espaço
para o encontro) eu encontrei uma sala com mais de 20 pessoas aguardando as
palestras! O encontro foi bem proveitoso e mais do que nunca percebíamos o
Guru-SP crescendo.</p>
<p>Eu considero que depois desse encontro o Guru-SP começou a andar sozinho,
conseguimos empresas parceiras para nos ajudar, o grupo cresceu bastante,
sempre tinhamos boas talks nos encontros e etc.</p>
<p>Hoje o Guru-SP tem mais de 1100 inscritos na lista, e já tivemos encontros
comuns com mais de 100 pessoas, isso sem contar os eventos que organizamos e
que tiveram mais de 200 pessoas.</p>
<p>Temos empresas que sempre nos ajudam, seja com espaço ou coffee break. Vale
agradecer a Caelum que por muito tempo nos forneceu o auditório mensalmente, e
ainda hoje sempre nor provê espaço quando precisamos. Não vou tentar citar
todas as empresas que ajudam porque sempre vou deixar uma de fora, mas dá para
ver cada um dos patrocínios <a href="http://gurusp.org/encontros">na página de encontros do Guru-SP</a>.</p>
<p>Atualmente o Guru-SP não é <strong>somente</strong> focado em Ruby, mas aproveitamos muitos
dos conhecimentos diversos de todos os participantes para trazer bom conteúdo
em várias partes da área de desenvolvimento, o que faz com que cada vez mais
tenhamos conteúdo legal e interação entre a galera.</p>
<p>Parabéns aos Guru-SP pelos 5 anos de vida e para todo mundo que ajudou (e/ou
ainda ajuda) na organização para fazer um dos grupos de Ruby mais ativos do
Brasil, e mais do que isso um lugar legal para troca de conhecimentos.</p>

            <description>Esse ano aconteceram algumas coisas zuadas para mim e resolvi capitalizar o dinheiro das coisas que eu tenho e começar denovo no ano que vem.
Procurei preços justos para tudo que estou vendendo (os links das minhas pesquisas estão nas descrições dos produtos), mas caso alguém ache que alguma das coisas está com um preço não-justo e estiver interessado é só entrar em contato que negociamos.
Estou aproveitando para testar a plataforma do loja integrada, mas os pagamentos eu prefiro que sejam por depósito mesmo, e se possível marcamos a entrega pessoalmente.</description>

(vulgo Marciano) about Game network programming. I was studying and reading
Quake source just for fun and decided to learn more about game networking in
general, so I decided to prepare this presentation to show other people what
I’ve learned. You can see the full video (portuguese only, sorry) and the slides
below.</p>
<p><strong>Portuguese</strong>: Eu e o Diego Souza (vulgo Marciano) fizemos uma palestra sobre
Game network programming tanto na Locaweb como no Guru-SP. A palestra que
fizemos no Guru-SP foi gravada pelo Agaelebe:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>E aqui estão os slides:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Como eu estava na vibe de jogos desde o começo do ano passado, eu estava lendo
os posts sobre o código do Quake. Quem me conhece sabe que eu trabalho na equipe
de IaaS da Locaweb e lá nós lidamos com bastante coisa de redes e eu curto o
assunto.</p>
<p>Conversando com o Diego sobre os algoritmos de redes utilizados no Quake nós
decidimos juntar as pesquisas dele sobre os protocolos TCP e UDP com o que eu li
sobre a implementação dos algoritmos nos jogos para poder fazer uma palestra
legal de game network programming, e assim saiu essa palestra.</p>
<p>Lá nós apresentamos os algoritmos de alguns jogos como o Quake, Age of Empires e
outros não tão conhecidos, mostrando as soluções legais que eles chegaram e
quais foram os maiores desafios que eles encontraram para resolver os problemas
de latencia e necessidade de velocidade. O Diego focou mais na parte de
otimização dos algoritmos e flags que podem ser alteradas para melhorar o
comportamento da rede.</p>
<p>Essa foi uma palestra muito legal de fazer e aprendi bastante no processo
também! Se tiverem dúvidas postem aí nos comentários. :)</p>

            <description>Depois de muito tempo desenvolvendo finalmente terminamos o Skeleton-Jigsaw em outubro! Demorei para postar sobre isso aqui no blog por falta de tempo, mas aqui está!
Eu e o Rafael Masoni trabalhamos nesse jogo durante quase 1 ano (começamos a falar dele no comecinho de janeiro) investindo nosso tempo livre para fazer todas as partes do jogo (audio, programação, arte, game design, level design e etc).
Vou descrever um pouco do que fizemos e como organizamos, mas vai ser apenas um resumo do que falamos na nossa palestra no Guru-SP:</description>

<p>Obrigado pelo vídeo Agaelebe!</p>
<p>Começamos a trabalhar em janeiro do ano passado no que seria um protótipo da
impact e aos poucos o jogo foi tomando forma e estavamos investindo cada vez
mais esforço nele. A cada semana fazíamos uma Skype call para discutir no que
trabalharíamos durante a semana e fazíamos o possível para entregar o que
conversamos até a próxima call.</p>
<p>Foi bem legal trabalhar em todos os pontos do jogo, opinando em arte,
trabalhando em trilha sonora, programando, discutindo level design, escrevendo
uma prévia de história, otimizando assets, testando em vários navegadores,
fazendo game design e tudo mais.</p>
<p>Todo esse trabalho trouxe muitas experiências legais de como é entregar um jogo
funcional e completo para o seu escopo, e estou bem orgulhoso de conseguir
entregar o jogo demo finalizado, e não deixar mais um trabalho incompleto
perdido por aí.</p>
<p>Ainda não sabemos quais os planos para a Plæv, mas agora ela já tem seu primeiro
jogo demo para não ficar com o portfolio em branco. :)</p>
<p>Não quis descrever muito aqui no post para não ficar somente repetindo conteúdo
do vídeo, mas se tiverem dúvidas coloquem nos comentários.</p>

            <description>Apesar de eu não ser bom o suficiente eu curto bastante jogar poker, mas as poucas vezes que me juntei com os amigos pessoalmente para jogar foi na época da faculdade, que marcavamos as &amp;ldquo;poker nights&amp;rdquo; e jogavamos apostando pequenas quantias.
Depois de sair da faculdade eu sempre penso em tentar juntar aquele pessoal novamente, ou até mesmo juntar outras pessoas para poder jogar, mas eu acho difícil conseguir contato com o aquele pessoal novamente e a galera que eu tenho contato hoje geralmente não sabem jogar e tampouco se importam em aprender, ainda mais quando sabem que o jogo só tem graça quando está valendo dinheiro.</description>

<p>Depois de sair da faculdade eu sempre penso em tentar juntar aquele

mas eu acho difícil conseguir contato com o aquele pessoal novamente e a galera
que eu tenho contato hoje geralmente não sabem jogar e tampouco se importam em
aprender, ainda mais quando sabem que o jogo só tem graça quando está valendo
dinheiro.</p>
<p>Há pouco tempo atrás eu estava assistindo um jogo de poker pela internet e
resolvi procurar mais informações, sobre quando aconteciam os jogos
(transmitidos pela internet) e até cheguei a ver alguns documentários e
reportagens de pessoas que vivem de poker e passam o dia jogando pela internet,
o que lhes traz uma quantia considerável por mês.</p>
<p>Resolvi começar a jogar pela internet novamente nas horas vagas e escolhi o
<a href="http://pt.partypoker.com/">partypoker</a> para brincar. Ao entrar no site descobri
que o instalador era para Windows, mas como eu já estava acostumado a ver sites
de poker com instalador para windows eu decidi usar a interface web deles que
funciona com um applet java e rolou tranquilo.</p>
<p>Jogar poker pela internet é bem divertido, e também necessário para quem quer levar
o jogo a sério, mas eu ainda sinto falta de juntar os amigos pessoalmente e passar
uma boa parte do tempo tentando adivinhar a poker face da galera para não ver meu
dinheiro se perdendo. :P</p>
<p>Se alguém aí costuma se juntar para jogar, não esqueçam de me incluir! :)</p>

            <description>I read the blog post from Impact engine creator Dominic where he shows an email he sent to John Carmack about his opinions on Javascript expressed on his keynote.
Dominic is trying to show that Javascript is not a good language to develop the next AAA game but it is awesome to make simple games and have it easily available to the world.
We have a lot of negative comments on the post (I really don&amp;rsquo;t know why) but some good ones too.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read the <a href="http://www.phoboslab.org/log/2012/08/letter-to-john-carmack">blog post</a>
from <a href="http://impactjs.com">Impact engine</a> creator
<a href="http://www.phoboslab.org/">Dominic</a> where he shows an email he sent to

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt-iVFxgFWk">his keynote</a>.</p>
<p>Dominic is trying to show that Javascript is not a good language
to develop the next AAA game but it is awesome to make simple
games and have it easily available to the world.</p>
<p>We have a lot of negative comments on the post (I really don&rsquo;t
know why) but some good ones too. One of the good comments was
written by John Carmack himself!</p>
<p>He was just explaining his point of view about Javascript and game
development, and said what we already know and is obvious (right?)
that javascript is not so fast to perform some kind of tasks.</p>
<p>Some people are dreaming that Javascript is so fast as C in some
cases but we know that it is not true for a whole game and the
native version will always run faster. But you should say that the
web (and the computers at all) are evolving each day, so the javascript
performance, but the native version is evolving as well and javascript
will always be some steps back.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s comment is really interesting because he knows that javascript
has its benefits but he also knows that some of the real problems they
are solving at <a href="http://idsoftware.com">Id Software</a>
will not be solved efficiently using Javascript (and a browser)
as the platform.</p>
<p>The conclusion for the discussion is what I was expecting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose the right tool for the right job&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are you doing a little 2D game? Try javascript,
and define the platforms for it to run. But if your game really needs
performance because you need to have the most impressive graphics,
you need to go native.</p>
<p>Obviously you should choose a lot of different languages / platforms as
well, you just need to decide which one is better for your business.</p>
<p>Use the right tool. That&rsquo;s it, no silver bullet. :)</p>

            <description>Since I bought an Acer notebook to use Linux again (I sold my mac, I have a post about it but in portuguese) I started to compile my own kernel.
The reasons for the decision:
I have a hardware that works better with the newer kernels. I really want to understand the linux kernel better. As Judas Priest sings on Painkiller song: “I’m living on the eeeeeedge”. LOL

have a post about it but in portuguese) I started to compile my own
kernel.</p>
<p>The reasons for the decision:</p>
<p>I have a hardware that works better with the newer kernels.
I really want to understand the linux kernel better.
As Judas Priest sings on Painkiller song: “I’m living on the eeeeeedge”. LOL</p>
<h3 id="how-to-proceed">How to proceed</h3>
<p>There are some steps to follow when compiling a new kernel for your
Linux box:</p>
<p>Clone the kernel repository with git, I made it using the Github url:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
</code></pre>
<p>Copy your .config file to the linux folder. If your distro have the
&ldquo;Enable config.gz&rdquo; flag enabled (most distros have it) you can use the
generated config as a base for your new compiled version:</p>
<pre><code>zcat /proc/config.gz &gt; linux/.config
</code></pre>
<p>Now that you have a functional config file (it was running on the
stock kernel right? ￼ ), just cd do the kernel folder and run make:</p>
<pre><code>cd linux
make
</code></pre>
<p>This process take about 40 minutes to finish on my i7, with 4GB of RAM
and SSD, running with -j4, to use all the 4 cores. Obviously the time
to finish will depend on what it will need to compile (defined on the
.config file) and the processing power of your machine. You can
improve this compiling time but I’ll talk more about it later.</p>
<p>You can use the compiling time to prepare the mkinitcpio file for the
installation. On my archlinux box I have created a file named
git.preset on /etc/mkinitcpio.d/ directory with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>ALL_config=&quot;/etc/mkinitcpio.conf&quot;
ALL_kver=&quot;/boot/vmlinuz-git&quot;

PRESETS=('default')

default_image=&quot;/boot/initramfs-git.img&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>After that you’ll need to change your bootloader conf a bit. I’m using
grub (not grub2 yet) which makes the setup really easy! Just change
your /boot/grub/menu.lst and add something like this:</p>
<pre><code>title  Git Kernel
root   (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-git root=/dev/sda2 ro quiet acpi_backlight=vendor init=/bin/systemd
initrd /initramfs-git.img
</code></pre>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: I’m using systemd to init and I need to define the
acpi_backlight to make my hardware to work properly, but probably
you’ll not need these parameters. If you’re using grub, you may find
useful to copy the other configuration of the same file and change
what needs to me changed (title and initrd).</p>
<p>When the compilation ends and your mkinitcpio file is ready you can
continue the process by generating the modules for your kernel:</p>
<pre><code>sudo make modules_install
</code></pre>
<p>This command will create a folder with the compiled modules on
/lib/modules. After that, just copy the generated image file to the
boot directory:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-git
</code></pre>
<p>And create the initial randisk environment for your preset using
mkinitcpio:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkinitcpio -p git
</code></pre>
<p>DONE! Your kernel is compiled and ready to boot! Just restart you
computer and choose the new item on the boot menu! ￼</p>
<h3 id="config-tunning">.config tunning</h3>
<p>So, your new kernel is running perfectly (I hope so…It’s a release
candidate, we never know what may happen :P), but you’ll want to go
deeply into the kernel options and improve the compiling time and the
disk space for the kernel, so lets tune the .config file to be
specific to our hardware!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: It will take a lot of time to get a good configuration
and you’ll not receive so much benefit from it, but it will be
fun. I promise.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started! Go to the linux kernel directory and run:</p>
<pre><code>make menuconfig
</code></pre>
<p>The fun part starts here because you’ll be seeing an awesome curses
screen with a lot of menus and submenus about a lot of things that you
never heard about, but no despair! Some things you already know, like
your processor for example! If you have an Intel processor is safe to
remove all the AMD related configurations from the .config file and
probably add some intel ones as built in (and vice versa).</p>
<p>Some things you need to have in mind when starting to buil your own
kernel configuration is that you really need to know what hardware
you’re running on your machine. This is really interesting because we
don’t care so much about some pieces of hardware nowadays, and you’ll
need to care about it if you want to build your own configuration
because you can’t remove these modules.</p>
<p>A good way to start is boot with the stock configuration, run lsmod
and backup this into a file. These modules should not be removed
because they are making your machine to work as it is working now, but
some of them should be marked as builtin into the kernel. I saw some
recommendations to not include the WIFI driver as builtin to avoid
some pre-load problems, so I’m keeping my WIFI driver as a module.</p>
<p>Some cool (but not so useful) parts can be found on “General Setup”:</p>
<p>Default hostname – This configuration will be specific, so name your
machine!  Local version – Append an string to the kernel release I
can’t help you so much on this journey because each hardware has its
own dependencies and corner cases, so you will need to compile and see
how it’s going to fit your needs.</p>
<h3 id="some-tips">Some tips</h3>
<p>If you’re planning to customize your configuration file I really
recommend to use a versioning control (like git) to keep tracking of
your file because you’ll need to revert some changes sometimes
(believe me) and git will help you to make this process less painful.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We are weird people (me for writting this and you to be interesting in
doing the same thing) but this process will help you to understand
some interesting things about your operating system and feel that
there is no magic happening there, this is just code that you can
change if you want. I was planning to end this article with “there is
no advantage on making this at all” but after remembering all the
process I think that I learned a lot, so it is worth it.</p>

            <description>TL; DR Usei mac por mais de 6 meses e decidi voltar ao Linux. Na minha opinião mac não é ruim, mas Linux é melhor.
A idéia desse post não é fazer um flame war, muito menos justificar porque eu voltei para o Linux (afinal, eu não devo nada pra ninguém), e sim falar um pouco do que eu vi de vantagens e desvantagens no Mac e porque eu resolvi voltar a usar Linux.</description>

mac não é ruim, mas Linux é melhor.</p>
<p>A idéia desse post não é fazer um flame war, muito menos justificar porque eu
voltei para o Linux (afinal, eu não devo nada pra ninguém), e sim falar um
pouco do que eu vi de vantagens e desvantagens no Mac e porque eu resolvi
voltar a usar Linux.</p>
<p>Bem, como muitos sabem eu comprei um Mac no meio do ano passado, era um
Macbook pro de 13 polegadas, i7, 4GB de RAM e etc. Como eu imaginava, era uma
maquina boa e estável para trabalhar, fazer minhas pesquisas e levar na
mochila (era muito mais leve e compacto que meu antigo Toshiba Satellite).</p>
<p>Antes de usar Mac eu estava usando o Toshiba Satellite que eu mencionei acima
usando Ubuntu como sistema operacional, e tudo estava indo bem sem contar o
peso que era levar o computador para a faculdade sempre.</p>
<p>Enfim, um colega foi para um evento fora do país e eu pedi para que comprasse
um Macbook pro para mim, e assim foi feito, estava com um Mac. Refiz tudo que
tinha do Linux para utilizar no estilo Mac, ou seja: Formatei todo o meu HD
para usar o formato do Mac, comecei a utilizar time machine, alterei uma boa
parte dos meus config files para aceitar Mac também e etc.</p>
<p>E lá começa meu uso do Mac, comecei a instalar as ferramentas que eu estava
utilizando na época. Primeiro começando com as ferramentas de desenvolvimento,
peguei um Xcode com um colega para não precisar baixar e a única coisa que ele
fez foi bugar e não deixar nem instalar nem desinstalar (sim, procurei na internet
tinham algumas soluções que supostamente resolviam mas não resolveram)&hellip;.
Enfim, foi a primeira coisa que eu instalalei, então foi só instalar o sistema denovo
e boa! Baixei o Xcode (mais de 1GB!!!!1!!!um!!), para poder compilar tudo que eu precisava
e tudo estava indo bem, só não parecia muito natural algumas coisas para quem
está acostumado a usar Linux, mas tava indo bem.</p>
<p>Nessa época eu estava terminando o meu TCC, que eu estava escrevendo com LaTeX,
portanto fui instalar um pacote do LaTeX no Mac, e lá se vão mais 1GB de pacotes&hellip;
Tudo bem, instalei e funcionou beleza.</p>
<p>Como já tinham dito, foi meio chatinho configurar o MySql mas funcionou de boas. O
homebrew ajuda bastante na tarefa de instalar coisas, é um slackbuilds do futuro,
tem várias receitas para resolver os casos de coisas que precisam ser instaladas,
e funciona bem.</p>
<p>Depois do ambiente todo feito o uso era bem tranquilo, e eu sentia que era bem
confortável para usar em coisas que não eram diretamente ligadas com programação.
Assistir minhas séries era bem legal, tinha alguns softwares que facilitavam
acompanhar algumas séries (TvShowsApp) e até baixar as legendas automaticamente
(Subsmarine), o que era bem comodo.</p>
<p>Eu tenho trabalhado bastante com HTML5 ultimamente portanto eu mantinha umas 5
versões de navegadores na maquina, e no Mac isso foi bem simples de fazer, apenas
arrastando os navegadores para a pasta de Apps e já era.</p>
<p>A resolução do Mac no meu monitor externo era fantástica comparada com a que eu
tinha antes no Toshiba, apesar de eu não usar muito o monitor externo. O som e
vídeo funcionam muito bem, como era de se esperar e apresentações, skype calls
e outras coisas eram bem simples e naturais de se fazer.</p>
<p>Algumas das aplicações que eu usava no Linux estavam disponíveis no Mac, como o
Vim por exemplo, que apesar de ter que instalar o Macvim ele ficava disponível
no terminal também. Tive que fazer algumas modificações para que o Vim funcionasse
como eu esperava, mas no fim das contas ele estava funcionando normalmente.
O GIMP no Mac é <strong>bem</strong> ruim, e deixa bastante a desejar, até porque ele sobe o
X para poder ser executado e foge completamente do padrão do Mac, o que já era
esperado, afinal não portaram o GIMP para rodar, apenas emularam o X e rodaram
sobre a plataforma do mac (não é só isso, mas o que eu quis dizer é que não é
um GIMP feito para mac específicamente, só fizeram ele rodar lá), e isso é bem
triste.</p>
<p>O tempo passou e eu tive a oportunidade de ir para San Francisco no OpenStack
Summit, e eu pensei em trocar de computador, e por coincidência um colega estava
perguntando se alguem estava vendendo um Macbook de 13&quot; (!!), não perdi tempo,
negociei e vendi por um preço muito bom (tendo em vista que comprei fora do país
e vendi por aqui). E comecei a consultar valores de outros computadores para
a substituição. Durante essa coleta de preços eu até cheguei a cogitar comprar o
Macbook Air, mas eu estava certo de que mac para mim já deu o que tinha que dar,
e agora era hora de voltar ao bom e velho Linux.</p>
<p>No fim das contas eu comprei o computador que possuía o melhor custo X benefício
para o que eu precisava, que é o Acer S3-951-6432, que possui tela de 13&quot;, SSD de
256, 4GB de memória, processador i7, leitor de cartão da Realtek, placa wireless
Atheros e uma placa de vídeo intel 3000.</p>
<p>Dessa vez eu queria usar Linux de verdade, conhecendo tudo o que eu estava utilizando
no sistema, portanto resolvi começar a usar <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, e comecei a saga de instalar
cada pacote, desde o sudo, passando pelo ifconfig, X, Awesome e por aí vai. A princípio
decidi ficar sem Gnome e configurar o Awesome para funcionar como eu queria, mas no fim
das contas eu acabei resolvendo instalar Gnome para facilitar as coisas de vez em quando.</p>
<p>Com o <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> eu consigo ter controle de tudo que está rodando e fico sempre no bleeding
edge de quase todos os softwares devido a filosofia de rolling updates dele. Aproveitei
também para começar a compilar meu próprio kernel, removendo módulos desnecessários e
adicionando outros que são necessários para meu hardware como builtin.</p>
<p>Não precisei ficar me preocupando com as ferramentas de desenvolvimento, tudo estava fácil
de arrumar, e não tive problema algum, foi só instalar o gcc e mandar bala! Para o LaTeX,
foi só instalar alguns poucos megas de TexLive e tudo estava funcionando. Pude voltar a usar
o bom e velho GIMP, juntamente com o Inkscape e tudo parecia mais feliz.</p>
<p>Alguns podiam comentar que eu poderia ter usado o Photoshop no Mac, mas eu to de boas de
pirataria, e o GIMP resolve todos os meus problemas&hellip;Não quero ficar gastando dinheiro
com software que não seja realmente necessário.</p>
<h3 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h3>
<p>O Mac não é um sistema ruim, é funcional e bem estável. O que eu constatei com isso
tudo é que o Mac apenas não é um Sistema operacional para mim, eu gosto mesmo é de
usar software livre, contribuir, customizar, conhecer coisas novas, tentar tunar meu
hardware para funcionar melhor, usar Window manager esquisito, compilar o kernel e etc.</p>
<p>Outra barreira que caiu foi o Mac nunca travar, ele travou como qualquer outro SO que eu
já usei, além de ser um SO muito mais lento do que eu esperava. Muitas pessoas me
disseram que isso era coisa do Lion ou que era porque eu tinha só 4 GB de RAM, mas
nenhum dos dois argumentos são válidos para mim, se o Lion é uma bosta o problema não é meu,
é só mais um motivo para eu parar de usar porcarias, e se eu preciso de 8GB de RAM para poder
ficar com um notebook usável, eu prefiro mil vezes usar Linux com 4 GB e ser feliz.</p>
<p>A minha opinião final foi que é totalmente possível trabalhar no Mac e programar todas as
coisas que se programa no Linux, a diferença é que no Linux é tudo mais natural de fazer
mas nada que compilar no mac ou usar o slackbuilds&hellip;digo&hellip;.homebrew&hellip; para fazer isso
não resolva, portanto ele ficou no mesmo patamar do Linux, cada um com suas vantagens e
desvantagens, e as vantagens do Linux me atraem mais do que as do Mac.</p>
<p>Ah, e não me venha com historinha que &ldquo;O legal do Mac é a experiencia&rdquo; que é conversa
de frutinha. :P</p>

            <description>Desde que eu terminei a faculdade eu venho lendo bastante coisa útil (foi muita coisa inútil durante 4 anos&amp;hellip;) e aprendendo bastante coisa. Nos ultimos meses eu li vários code reviews dos códigos do Quake e do Doom.
Os review foram feitos por Fabien Anglard e estão todos disponíveis no site dele http://fabiensanglard.net.
O primeiro artigo que eu li foi sobre o code review do código do Quake 2 de 1997.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Desde que eu terminei a faculdade eu venho lendo bastante coisa útil (foi muita
coisa inútil durante 4 anos&hellip;) e aprendendo bastante coisa. Nos ultimos meses
eu li vários code reviews dos códigos do Quake e do Doom.</p>
<p>Os review foram feitos por Fabien Anglard e estão todos disponíveis no site dele
<a href="http://fabiensanglard.net">http://fabiensanglard.net</a>.</p>
<p>O primeiro artigo que eu li foi sobre o
<a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/quake2/index.php">code review do código do Quake 2 de 1997</a>.
Esse quake foi o ultimo que fez Software Rendering e o cara que analizou o código
explica direitinho como foi feito, explicando todos os problemas que os
desenvolvedores enfrentaram e porque eles chegaram aquela implementação. Para
quem é programador e curte Quake é uma ótima leitura.</p>
<p>Uma coisa muito interessante que vi na leitura desse artigo foi que eu acabei
estudando várias outras coisas para poder entender o artigo, como:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSP trees: <a href="http://downloads.gamedev.net/pdf/gpbb/gpbb59.pdf">http://downloads.gamedev.net/pdf/gpbb/gpbb59.pdf</a></li>
<li>Octree: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree</a></li>
<li>Memory management: <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/CNS/RESEARCH/LinuxClusters/mem.html">http://www.ualberta.ca/CNS/RESEARCH/LinuxClusters/mem.html</a></li>
<li>Radiosity: <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/radiosity/radiosity.htm">http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/radiosity/radiosity.htm </a> (esse artigo é animal)</li>
</ul>
<p>E outras coisas do mesmo genero.</p>
<p>Com o lançamento do código do DOOM 3 open source, mais um code review foi
escrito: <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/">http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/</a>,
e nesse review ele explica como a parte de iluminação (que era a grande
funcionalidade do Doom 3) foi feita e quais as técnicas foram utilizadas.
Apesar de eu conhecer pouco de renderização e algoritmos de iluminação é
possível entender uma boa parte desse review.</p>
<p>E por ultimo li o <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/index.php">code review do código do Quake III</a>,
que mostra uma das coisas que eu estava curioso para ler, networking! Todos
sabemos que a parte de redes (não somente ela, acho que tudo) precisa de
velocidade, e eu queria entender o que os caras planejaram para essa camada, e
isso é uma das coisas que o code review traz, inclusive linkando para a análise da antiga
engine do Quake e explicando algumas decisões e as premissas simples que foram
utilizadas para construir uma camada consistente e deixar o jogo o mais fluido possível.</p>
<p>Esse ultimo code review acaba muito legal, linkando para a IA do Quake III,
que é muito boa por sinal, e por isso rendeu uma
<a href="http://dev.johnstevenson.co.uk/bots/20585341-The-Quake-III-Arena-Bot.pdf">tese de mestrado do desenvolvedor</a>
que apesar de eu não ter lido inteira, eu recomendo a leitura para quem se interessa no assunto.</p>
<p>Enfim, todos sabem que o <a href="http://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/">John Carmack</a> é
um dos programadores que eu mais admiro, e Quake é um dos jogos que eu mais
curto, e o código é open source! Esse review era a oportunidade que faltava
para conhecer o código melhor e aprender coisas novas. Se você curte jogos e
programação <strong>RECOMENDO</strong> fortemente tirar algumas horas e ler os reviews!</p>

            <description>Every time we need to deploy a new Ruby application on top of Debian Squeeze we need to fix some Ruby depedencies to make the application work as it should.
It happens because we&amp;rsquo;re building using rvm instead of the packaged version of ruby, but it needed to be that way in order to use our old build server.
I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it documented here:
ln -s /usr/lib/libruby-1.9.1.so.1.9.1 /usr/lib/libruby.so.1.9 ln -s /usr/bin/rake1.</description>

            <description>Esse post ficou como draft desde que eu palestrei sobre implementações paralelas, e agora que eu lembrei dele decidi publicar! :)
Bem, como eu disse, eu paletrei sobre implementacoes paralelas tanto na Locaweb como no Guru-SP. A idea da palestra vem de um post do John Carmack sobre implementações paralelas, e nesse post ele comenta sobre todos os tipos de implementação paralela que ele já utilizou e as que mais funcionaram para cada tipo de caso.</description>

            <description>TL; DR Fiz uma viagem de moto saindo de São Paulo e indo para Eldorado (Argentina) , durou uma semana no total e rodei mais de 3000km, esse é o relato da viagem.
Quem quiser ver todas as fotos que eu tirei durante a viagem, estão no Picasa
Bem, vamos ao relato:
Essa foi minha primeira viagem para fora do Brasil e também a minha primeira viagem grande de moto (tinha feito uma de 700km no total 350 contínuo), e é claro que com essas condições eu tava meio perdido para organizar as coisas, preocupado com a moto e etc.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL; DR</strong> Fiz uma viagem de moto saindo de São Paulo e indo para Eldorado (Argentina)
, durou uma semana no total e rodei mais de 3000km, esse é o relato da viagem.</p>
<p>Quem quiser ver todas as fotos que eu tirei durante a viagem, estão no <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101222028988922245434/ISRACruiseInSouthAmerica?authuser=0&amp;feat=directlink">Picasa</a></p>
<p>Bem, vamos ao relato:</p>
<p>Essa foi minha primeira viagem para fora do Brasil e também a minha primeira viagem
grande de moto (tinha feito uma de 700km no total 350 contínuo), e é claro que com
essas condições eu tava meio perdido para organizar as coisas, preocupado com a moto e etc.</p>
<p>Após organizar tudo certinho na sexta a noite tentei dormir cedo porque as 6:00 AM
eu deveria estar no posto hungria preparado para sair, isso quer dizer que as 4:30
eu teria que estar de pé. Acho que demorei meia hora para conseguir dormir, mas ainda
era 23:30 eu suponho.</p>
<p>No dia seguinte eu estava acordado e sem sono às 4:30 amarrando as ultimas coisas
na moto e saindo às 5:30 após se despedir dos meus pais que acordaram junto só para
me ver saindo :P. No meio do caminho encontrei meu amigo David na imigrantes, ele
me acompanhou até o posto hungria de moto para ver a galera saindo. Valeu David!</p>
<p>Chegando no posto hungria já tinha 80% das pessoas que iam na viagem e mais várias
outras que só foram nos encontrar para desejar uma boa viagem e ver a galera saindo.
Fizemos nosso briefing às 6:30, alguem puxou uma oração antes de sair e saimos
as 6:40 no máximo.</p>
<p>Infelizmente eu não anotei onde foi cada uma das paradas, estradas, kilometros e
etc, portanto eu não vou descrever com detalhes o suficiente. Na primeira parada
encontramos mais um amigo que sairia de Mairinque e iria com a gente, e nos despedíamos
dos que estavam no bonde (bonde == conjuntos de motos) mas não iriam seguir viagem conosco.</p>
<p>Após as despedidas seguimos viagem e mantivemos nosso ritmo de parada de mais ou
menos 150km. Perto do meio dia nós paramos para comer alguma coisa em Assis (se não
me engano) e o sol já estava bem quente, o que me fez tirar a jaqueta e viajar somente
de colete. Uma coisa que eu nunca curti foi usar protetor solar para andar de moto
, mas dessa vez se eu não tivesse usado eu teria queimado feio os braços, descobri
isso porque minha calça sempre voava com o vento e com isso o sol chegava até a perna
, o que me causou uma queimadura chata de sol.</p>
<p>Segundo o Google Latitude (como não anotei nada e ele ficou guardando, estou usando
ele para saber onde eu estava&hellip;LOL) chegamos em Maringá por volta das 14:30 e encontramos
nosso amigo Walter Santos (a.k.a Wartão :P) no centro da cidade, e ele nos guiou
até o hotel araucária, que é onde íamos ficar essa noite.</p>
<p>Fizemos check-in e pegamos quartos com duas camas separadas e dividimos, como estávamos
em 10 motos pegamos 4 quartos. Tentamos deixar reservados os quartos nesse hotel
para a volta mas ficamos sabendo que ia ter um evento e todos os quartos já estavam
reservados, portanto quem não reservou com antecedência ia ter que arrumar outro
lugar para ficar. Eu não tinha reservado com antecedência e passei em outros hotéis
em volta para ver se achava algo, mas os que eram razoávelmente decentes já não tinham
vagas, então deixei rolar.</p>
<p>O Walter que nos encontrou no centro de Maringá nos chamou para um churrasco em sua
casa. Uma coisa interessante é que ele não conhecia nenhum de nós pessoalmente e
mesmo assim nos recebeu em sua casa de portas abertas e com um churrasco fantástico.
Esse tipo de coisa que me faz acreditar que as pessoas podem ser legais.</p>
<p>Saímos da casa do Walter as 23:30 e voltamos para o Hotel. Saímos de Maringá as 8
:30 em direção a Foz do Iguaçu, mas antes passamos na casa do Walter para acordar
ele com os barulhos de escapamento e dar um abraço antes da partida, saindo de lá
seguimos o mesmo estilo de paradas até foz, 150 em 150km. Chegamos mais ou menos
as 16:00 em Foz do Iguaçu e fizemos check-in no Luz hotel no mesmo esquema, dividindo
quartos, dessa vez dividi quarto com o Mikele, mas alguns de nós pegaram quartos
quadruplos conseguindo um preço mais barato.</p>
<p>No começo da tarde chegaram as constelações (cada grupo do ISRA é considerado uma
constelação) de Brasília e Goiás no Luz hotel e no total eramos em mais ou menos
25 motos. A noite saimos para jantar num restaurante próximo do hotel, ocupamos uma
boa parte do restaurante e causamos uma impressão interessante nas pessoas que estavam
lá, fora a cara de espanto (que eu já estava acostumado naquela hora) também rolou
um silencio estranho :P.</p>
<p>Fui dormir não muito tarde pois pretendia sair bastante no outro dia. Muitos dos
que estavam no grupo tinham vindo no ano passado a Foz, portanto fizeram todos os
passeios turísticos e não pretendiam faze-los novamente. Eu tinha deixado claro que
eu ia para a usina de itaipú e para as cataratas e se ninguém fosse eu ia sozinho
mesmo. No fim das contas consegui companhia para ir para a Usina de manhã, fomos
em 2 motos, eu com minha Dragstar e o Honda com sua Fatboy. Outras pessoas foram
ao Paraguay, Duty free e outros lugares, inclusive, a esposa do Yuri foi com a gente
para Itaipú porque o Yuri foi ao Paraguay.</p>
<p>A usina de Itaipú é um lugar bem legal e fazer o passeio completo (com visita ao
interior da usina) é muito legal para os nerds de plantão, é possível ter informações
do funcionamento das turbinas e saber um pouco mais sobre a engenharia da usina,
além de algumas curiosidades sobre os funcionários e o acordo entre os países para
que a usina funcione. Dentro da usina é possível sentir a vibração que a força da
agua causa enquanto ela passa pelos tubos e aciona as turbinas, é uma sensação bem
legal (e medonha). Outra vantagem do passeio interno é ir até o eixo de uma das turbinas
e ver ele funcionando há quase 100 metros abaixo da superfície. Tirei fotos de todo
o passeio, e ta tudo lá no Picasa.</p>
<p>Voltamos ao Hotel por volta das 13, almoçamos e fomos para as cataratas, dessa vez
em 3 motos, Yuri e sua esposa Ju com uma Suzuki V-Strom, eu com minha DS e o Berlanas
com uma Fazer 600. Decidimos apenas fazer o passeio a pé (tem passeio de barco pelas
cataratas, mas é mais caro e não rola levar camera) pelas trilhas para conhecer toda
a extensão das cataratas e tirar umas fotos. O passeio é muito legal, além de ver
as cataratas por vários angulos você ainda se depara com uns quatis que ficam andando
pelas trilhas procurando comida dos turistas. Fizemos o passeio completo por mais
de 1km de trilhas e tirei muitas fotos (também no Picasa) e valeu muito a pena conhecer
o lado brasileiro das cataratas, recomendo!</p>
<p>Na saída encontrei um outro motociclista com o colete dos &ldquo;Bodes do asfalto&rdquo;, não
me era estranho esse motoclube e resolvi puxar conversa, acabei descobrindo que ele
também estava vindo de São Paulo e estava indo para a Argentina (um pouco além de
onde iríamos), mas o mais impressionante de tudo é que ele estava vindo do ABC e
trabalha em Diadema! Conversando descobri que ele trabalha a dois quarteirões de
onde minha mãe trabalha, e a coincidencia fez eu o encontrar há mais de 1000km de
distância! Isso foi bizarro.</p>
<p>Na saída das cataratas o pessoal que estava comigo decidiu passar no Duty free e
eu não estava afim de ir, portanto voltei sozinho para o Hotel, que é muito bem localizado
por sinal, ao lado da rodoviária de Foz do Iguaçu, recomendo esse hotel.</p>
<p>No dia seguinte tinhamos marcado de sair as 8 horas mas o nosso grupo já estava muito
grande e para todo mundo se preparar ia demorar bem mais do que o esperado. Estacionamos
as 25 motos na calçada do hotel enquanto esperavamos a hora de sair. Enquanto esperavamos
um onibus foi fazer a curva na rua e encostou na primeira moto, o que causou um efeito
dominó nas 3 outras. O motorista do onibus parou e começaram as discussões para resolver
. Duas motos foram danificadas, mas nada muito grave, um retrovisor quebrado e alguns
riscos e o onibus estava intacto. Todos tinham uma parcela de culpa nesse acidente
, essas motos estavam estacionadas muito perto da esquina e o motorista do onibus
nem reduziu na curva. Não sei como ficou o desfecho dessa história, mas acho que
apenas resolveram seguir para evitar mais dor de cabeça.</p>
<p>Enquanto alguns foram numa concessionária para resolver as avarias das motos os outros
seguiram em direção a Argentina. Passamos facilmente pela fronteira do Brasil e paramos
na ponte da amizade para tirar umas fotos das motos estacionadas no território brasileiro
antes de atravessar para a Argentina. Após as fotos fomos em direção a Aduana da
Argentina, passamos tranquilamente e ficamos aguardando no próximo posto de combustível disponível.</p>
<p>Enquanto estavamos aguardando descobrimos que a Van que levava as malas e as esposas
do pessoal de Brasília não conseguiu passar para fronteira da Argentina por alguns
problemas e eles teriam que conseguir outro modo de trazer as malas, portanto seguimos
para Eldorado enquanto eles descobriam uma melhor forma de passar.</p>
<p>Rodamos pouco mais de 100km em direção a Eldorado e chegamos pouco antes da hora
do almoço no hotel Don Juan em Eldorado. Pouco tempo depois chegou o pessoal do ISRA
da Argentina, cumprimentaram-nos e saímos para almoçar num restaurante brasileiro
que tinha perto do hotel. Ficamos no hotel esperando o resto do pessoal chegar, o
que só aconteceu as 17:00 mais ou menos.</p>
<p>As 20:00 o pessoal da Argentina nos chamou para dar um role pela cidade e saímos
me 36 motos pela pequena cidade de Eldorado, estacionando na praça central da cidade
. Achei meio estranho esse passeio porque era muito chamariz, e não sou muito fã
de ser o centro das atenções, o que era inevitável quando você estava junto com outras
35 motos gigantes e barulhentas que param no meio da praça central da cidade. No
fim das contas esse tipo de passeio foi um evento para a cidade, vários moradores
se juntando na praça para tirar fotos, perguntando de onde viemos, crianças olhando
as motos com cara de admiração e outras coisas.
Saindo de lá fomos direto para o restaurante do Ulises que organizou umas pizzas
para a galera. Ficamos lá até às 23:00 mais ou menos e voltamos para o Hotel.</p>
<p>No dia seguinte quando acordei vi uma movimentação e descobri que algumas pessoas
tinham acabado de sair para ver as cataratas do lado argentino, mas já era tarde
demais para acompanhá-los, portanto tomei meu café e fiquei conversando com a galera
. Resolvemos sair para procurar umas peças para a moto do Yuri e de lá iriamos para
um outro lugar com os argentinos, mas no fim das contas ficamos rodando num sol bem
quente pelo centro da cidade e não achamos as peças, muito menos saimos com os argentinos
, portanto voltamos para o Hotel.
Durante as conversas com o pessoal no hotel eu descobri que alguns estavam querendo
ir para Wanda ver as minerações e eu fiquei pensando se deveria ir ou não, mas cheguei
a conclusão que se fosse para ficar parado eu tinha ficado em casa e fui à Wanda!</p>
<p>Fomos em 5 motos: Cidão e Loira numa Midnight 950 Azul, Eu com a DS, Berlanas na
Fazer 600, Samuca na DS cinza, Yuri e Ju na Suzuki V-Strom e Totta na Ds vermelha
(muito bonita essa moto por sinal!). Wanda é um lugar de minério, e a atração são
as pedras semi preciosas que tem nas minas, tirei várias fotos para quem quiser ver
. Na saída comprei um triangulo feito de uma pedra azul e 3 brincos de ametista para
dar de presente aqui, coloquei no bolso do colete e saimos. No meio do caminho coloquei
a mão no colete e só tinha o triangulo, os brincos e meu 100 pesos foram para a estrada
&hellip; Fiquei meio triste pela burrice que fiz em ter deixado eles no colete, mas considerei
isso como &ldquo;um gole pro santo&rdquo; e bola pra frente.</p>
<p>Chegando no hotel eu encostei na cama e apaguei por mais de 1 hora, fazia anos que
eu não conseguia dormir a tarde, o que mostrou meu meu corpo estava jóia&hellip; A noite
rolou mais um tour pela cidade com outra parada na praça central, onde rolou umas
zoeiras com um colete rosa (entregue a quem for o vigésimo quarto a acessar o fórum
mais vezes no ano) e umas fotos das motos e depois fomos novamente para o Ulises,
dessa vez comer lasagna. Chegando no Ulises eu vi um colega argentino caindo lentamente
com a moto parada, achamos até que era brincadeira, mas a moto inclinou demais na
areia e ele não conseguiu segurar (era um Dragstar 1100), nada demais.</p>
<p>No dia seguinte acordamos cedo e fomos para as cataratas do lado argentino, dessa
vez fomos em mais motos e não vou conseguir citar todas porque um pessoal de Brasilia
/Goias foi com a gente, mas estávamos em 7 ou 8 motos mais ou menos. Pretendíamos
visitar as cataratas e sair mais ou menos as 13:30 para encontrar nossos amigos que
estavam vindo de São Paulo pouco depois da fronteira argentina.</p>
<p>Aqui vale um grande parenteses antes de continuar a história, esses nossos amigos
saíram de São Paulo na quarta feira, dormiram em Maringá, saíram de Maringá de manhã
, chegaram na argentina por volta das 14 e iriam jantar com a gente para poder voltar
para SP no dia seguinte. :D</p>
<p>Voltando as cataratas, a bateria da minha câmera acabou antes mesmo de começar o
caminho a pé para as cataratas, portanto as fotos que estão no Picasa foram tiradas
pelo meu celular. Quando vimos o tempo mudando rapidamente resolvemos voltar correndo
, mas não fomos rápido o suficiente e ficamos presos no tremzinho esperando a chuva
passar (impediram o trem de sair enquanto estivesse com chuva). Quando conseguimos
sair já era mais de 14:30 e estávamos atrasados para encontrar nossos amigos. Chegamos
no posto onde eles estavam por volta das 15:00 e começamos a viagem de volta para
Eldorado (100km mais ou menos) sob chuva fraca. As estradas nesse ponto da argentina
são muito barrentas e os caminhões banhávam-nos de barro, o que deixou minha moto
praticamente marrom, é como se eu tivesse participado de algum rally com ela.</p>
<p>Chegamos no Hotel umas 16:30 mais ou menos e saimos mais tarde para a confraternização
oficial do evento novamente no restaurante do Ulisses, onde houve apresentação de
todos, entrega de brasões brinde aos amigos e etc. Essa noite estava um tempo chuvoso
e um frio durante a noite, portanto esperávamos um clima não muito bom para o dia
seguinte. Decidimos que sairíamos as 6 da manhã do hotel rumo a Maringá, não haveria
parada longa em Foz dessa vez. Eu estava dividindo um quarto sextuplo (existe isso
!?) com o Yuri e a Ju (numa cama de casal no andar de baixo), Mikele e Berlanas.
Eu, Mikele e Berlanas ficamos na parte de cima (que só dava para subir utilizando
uma escada de Santos Dumont (tem foto dela no Picasa)), e quando as pessoas que você
interage são legais não tem como não haver momentos engraçados, como o maldito galo
que os caras tinham como despertador do celular. :P</p>
<p>Acordamos (com o maldito ringtone do galo) as 5 da manhã, amarramos as coisas na
moto e saímos as 6:30 sob uma neblina forte até a fronteira da argentina. Dessa vez
o bonde foi dividido em 2, pois alguns de nós acharam que 6 horas era muito cedo
para sair e resolveram sair um pouco mais tarde. Atravessamos tranquilamente tanto
a fronteira da Argentina como a fronteira brasileira, e o clima esquentou novamente
, nada de neblina, só um . Uma das coisas que vai ficar marcada é a sensação de felicidade
de estar de volta ao meu país e voltar a ver as placas em português, apesar de eu
ficar meio confuso com os idiomas.</p>
<p>Paramos para tomar café só em Céu Azul, onde eu ouvia pessoas aleatórias falando
em português e ficava todo confuso pensando qual lingua eles estavam falando, hahaha
. Seguimos no mesmo ritmo de sempre até Maringá. Antes de chegarmos lá encontramos
nosso amigo Walter e sua filha no meio do caminho, eles foram com a gente até o Hotel
. Novamente o Walter mostrou a pessoa foda que ele é e nos ofereceu sua casa caso
alguem não tivesse quarto no hotel (devido ao evento que eu comentei antes), mas
não foi necessário. Eu dividi um quarto com o Mariano. O quarto que ficamos estava
com a pia quebrada, por isso rolou um desconto (melhor ainda! :P). Ao chegar no quarto
eu apaguei várias horas, quando acordei uma parte do pessoal já tinha saído e só
ficou um casal. Quase todos foram de Taxi para a casa do Walter, apenas eu e o Samuca
fomos de moto, o Samuca ia sair direto de lá e eu me recuso a andar de taxi numa
viagem que estou fazendo de moto.</p>
<p>Novamente o Walter fez um jantar esplendido para nós. Sem comentários, a família
muito atenciosa conosco, nos trataram muito bem e fizeram o possível para que nos
sentíssemos em casa, só temos a agradecer pela recepção, sua família é foda!</p>
<p>Eu cheguei, subi para o quarto e capotei. No outro dia tomamos café e saímos as 8
:30 em direção a SP, no mesmo ritmo, mas agora o bonde estava maior, estavamos em
15 motos, e quando mais gente mais difícil manter a organização. Dessa vez não marcamos
uma posição fixa das motos, apenas tentamos manter os garupados a frente e as Dragstars
depois.</p>
<p>Outra coisa que vai ficar muito na lembrança é a felicidade de estar de volta ao
meu estado, ver os amigos da frente com o braço para cima apontando para a placa,
ou soltando as duas mãos do guidão e abrindo os braços, são cenas que marcam para
sempre.</p>
<p>No trevo de ourinhos tivemos um pequeno acidente, o Fernando que estava na minha
frente entrou um pouco mais rápido na curva e o asfalto não estava nada bom, cheio
de ondulações, portanto ele conseguiu frear mas foi jogado fora da pista onde tinha
areia e pedras e com isso o freio apenas jogou uma das rodas da Dragstar em uma direção
levando os dois (ele e sua namorada/esposa) ao chão. Como eu era o que estava mais
próximo, já desliguei minha moto e fui ajudá-lo, levantei a moto para que ele pudesse
tirar o pé de baixo e alguém me ajudou a colocar a moto de pé, perguntei se estava
tudo bem e ele falou que estava de boas, a esposa dele também, então fomos ver as
avarias da moto. A moto só estava com o comando avançado torto (ele sempre salva,
foi assim no meu acidente também), que conseguimos desentortar apenas com o peso
do corpo e alguns pouco ralados na manopla, ligamos e a moto estava funcionando de
boa. Obviamente, qundo a moto ligou rolou um &ldquo;Aeeee, isso é Dragstar rapá! Não para
não!&rdquo; :).</p>
<p>Seguimos até o próximo posto onde já estavamos programados de parar e o Cidão fez
um curativo no joelho do Fernando que estava um pouco ralado e foi isso, nada muito
grave, apenas algumas dores do impacto com o chão e alguns ralados, nada que os impedisse
de voltar de moto para casa.</p>
<p>Continuamos viagem e no meio do caminho algumas motos se adiantaram porque o Cidão
estava com problemas com primeira e segunda marcha, então foram na frente. Nos despedimos
do Tiago, do Ernesto e do Berlanas em uma das paradas, pois cada um ia seguir seu
próprio caminho ou pretendia esticar um pouco mais. Seguimos com o ultimo bonde entre
120/130 km/h e paramos para abastecer novamente depois de 140km. Nesse posto o pessoal
que seguiu com o Cidão estava parado jantando e muitos decidiram se juntar a eles
para fazer o jantar de confraternização.</p>
<p>Eu estava planejando passar no casamento do meu amigo Rafael Timbó para lhe dar um
abraço de parabens e desejar felicidade nessa nova etapa, mesmo estando todo mulambento
da viagem, portanto não fiquei para o jantar de confratermização e segui solo para
SP. Chegando na marginal Tietê eu parei para ver onde era o casamento e descobri
que era na Serra da cantareira, nunca tinha ido para lá, iria ser uma grande aventura,
afinal estava escuro e eu estava há mais de 10 horas andando de moto.</p>
<p>Fui seguindo e perguntando, cheguei até o Tucuruvi, peguei a Cel. Sezefredo e segui
, pelo que li no site deles, era perto  de um tal restaurante Dib, que pelo que me
informaram, era uns 13km serra da cantareira a dentro. A informação que eu recebi
foi meio medonha: &ldquo;Vai seguindo, quando vc ver que só tem uma estrada, sem luzes
e for arvores dos dois lados é que vc está no caminho certo, quando vc ver a Fernão
Dias à sua direita é que ta chegando perto&rdquo;. Ok, vamos nessa! Quando começou a chegar
nesse ponto das arvores ficou bem medonho, tava tudo escuro, apenas o farol da moto
ligado e o barulho do meu escapamento, a frente apenas curvas bem fechadas iluminadas
pelo farol, e acima estavam as copas das árvores com uma fresta que me mostrava a
beleza da lua cheia escondida atrás de algumas nuvens, pensei até em tirar foto,
mas não podia parar ali era perigoso demais, mas essa cena também via ficar marcada
na minha mente por um bom tempo, juntamente com a sensação estranha de estar num
lugar desconhecido e desolado. Durante o caminho eu vi algumas plaquinhas escrito
&ldquo;Rafael e Sabrina&rdquo; que me mostravam que eu estava indo no caminho certo, mas em alguns
pontos tinham umas encruzilhadas que era difícil saber qual era o caminho certo,
e eu provavelmente peguei o caminho errado em alguma dessas, indo para um lugar mais
desolado ainda, depois de uns 5km andando no breu eu encontrei alguma luz, e quando
parei para perguntar descobri que nem os seguranças sabiam o nome da rua direito,
pqp. Um pouco mais a frente parei um cara de carro e perguntei, ele me falou que
eu tinha passado faz tempo e tinha que voltar por essa estrada medonha&hellip;Perguntei
para ele se a estrada que eu estava vendo a minha frente era mesmo a Fernão Dias
sentido São Paulo, e ele me confirmou. Depois de tudo isso tive que pesar, já estava
há mais de 11 horas em cima da moto, cansado, e não queria pegar aquela estrada estranha
novamente, portanto, com muito pesar deixei de felicitar meu amigo e resolvi voltar
para casa, pensando que a serra da cantareira foram os ~15km mais difíceis da minha
viagem.</p>
<p>Depois de tudo isso, ainda passei pela placa de divisa entre Mairiporã e São Paulo,
o que me lembrou a minha viagem para São Thomé das Letras! O que tornou tudo mais
interessante, quem diria que no fim de uma grande viagem eu ia sair de encontro com
o fim de outra das minhas viagens (um pouco menor naquela ocasião), o que causou
várias outras boas lembranças.</p>
<p>Vim para casa, passei na casa da minha noiva e ainda chamei ela para dar um role
de moto e ir comer alguma coisa (só tinha tomado café, comido uma esfirra e um salgadinho
o dia todo), depois de deixa-la em casa fui para a minha e levei tudo para o meu
quarto e dormi do jeito que estava&hellip;Minha mãe chegou para me dar um oi, mas deixou
para o outro dia.</p>
<p>Algumas informações legais e aprendizados sobre a viagem:</p>
<p>Eu era o mais novo do grupo 23 anos, o mais velho (que eu achei) tem 69, as frases
que eu mais ouvi foram: &ldquo;Você é jovem ainda&rdquo;, &ldquo;você vai ver quando tiver a minha
idade&rdquo; e etc. Ser o mais novo me permitiu aprender muita coisa com essas pessoas,
pegar experiências de viagens e até mesmo experiências de vida que me fizeram uma
pessoa muito melhor, além de obviamente me tornar um motociclista melhor.</p>
<p>Conversando com a Loira (esposa do Cidão) eu ouvi a frase: &ldquo;Sempre que eu viajo eu
quero conhecer tudo, porque eu provavelmente nunca mais vou voltar nesse lugar&rdquo;.
Isso me fez pensar por muito tempo, e realmente é verdade, vou levar para a vida isso.</p>
<p>Obviamente não concordamos com tudo que acontece, principalmente quando se está num
grupo grande, muitas vezes os meus valores são completamente diferentes dos valores
de outra pessoa e com isso sempre vai acontecer coisas que você não gosta ou despreza.</p>
<p>No geral, eu posso dizer que essa viagem valeu <strong>muito</strong> a pena e eu com certeza
faria ela novamente, do jeito que foi, ou diferente.</p>
<p>E uma coisa que eu posso afirmar é que eu saí de São Paulo com 10 conhecidos de forum
, e voltei com 10 (ou mais) amigos.</p>

            <description>Esse fim de semana eu palestrei no FLISOL de São José dos Campos sobre desenvolvimento de jogos, Javascript e HTML5. Foi uma palestra simples e rápida, durou pouco mais de meia hora (preciso aprender a falar um pouco mais devagar :P) mas foi divertido.
A grande maioria das pessoas que estavam assistindo a palestra não eram desenvolvedores, e estavam começando a estudar agora, e acho que por isso não surgiram muitas perguntas sobre o assunto, mesmo eu evitando colocar código.</description>

            <description>Estou começando a fazer meu TCC agora e resolvi brincar um pouco com LaTeX. Ja faz um bom tempo que eu queria brincar um pouco com ele, entender melhor como funciona e por que tanta gente usa ele e acha legal.
Eu tive um pouco de experiência com LaTeX quando estava ajudando a escrever o vimbook, mas não tive contato o suficiente por que entrei no meio do projeto e já estava tudo pronto, foi só seguir a estrutura.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Estou começando a fazer meu TCC agora e resolvi brincar um pouco com LaTeX. Ja
faz um bom tempo que eu queria brincar um pouco com ele, entender melhor como
funciona e por que tanta gente usa ele e acha legal.</p>
<p>Eu tive um pouco de experiência com LaTeX quando estava ajudando a escrever o
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/vimbook/">vimbook</a>, mas não tive contato o suficiente
por que entrei no meio do projeto e já estava tudo pronto, foi só seguir a
estrutura.</p>
<p>O que eu achei interessante nisso tudo foi um dos comentários que eu ouvi: &ldquo;Por
que você não usa o Word, é bem mais fácil&rdquo;.
Eu não discordo que provavelmente é mais fácil no Word, apesar de você perder o
log de alterações, não ter o arquivo distribuído automáticamente (como eu to
fazendo com o Git) e outras coisas. Quem me conhece sabe que nem de Windows eu
gosto, mas eu poderia usar OpenOffice e um template e tal.</p>
<p>O mais interessante nisso tudo é conhecer várias coisas, saber o que é bom e
ruim ao invés de ficar coletando informações de algumas pessoas (que as vezes
nem utilizaram para dar opinião) e utilizar isso como &ldquo;conhecimento&rdquo; da
tecnologia.</p>
<p>Se você resolve perguntar para uma pessoa dessas se ela conhece textile,
markdown, LaTeX ou qualquer coisa do genero, ele vai responder que <strong>não</strong>, ou
seja, o maledeto só conhece o Word e considera isso a melhor ferramenta do
mundo, não tem nem como argumentar sobre mais nada por que nunca usou.</p>
<p>Enfim, esse foi apenas um caso besta que aconteceu comigo, mas isso acontece com
muita coisa, como programação por exemplo! Pessoas que só usam Java, ou só usam
Python, ou só usam Ruby, ou qualquer outra, e vem falar da outra linguagem
apenas se baseando no que ouviu falar, sem nem mesmo ter usado para sentir os
problemas e as vantagens da linguagem.</p>
<p>E mais uma vez, esse foi só mais um exemplo, isso acontece muito ultimamente,
pessoas que simplesmente querem &ldquo;dar sua opinião&rdquo; sobre uma coisa, independente
se conhecem ou não essa coisa.</p>
<p>Se quer mesmo dar sua opinião, tenha pelo menos algum conhecimento prático
(mesmo que seja básico) sobre o assunto, ou então STFU. :)</p>

            <description>Logo depois que eu comprei a minha Dragstar 650, me deu uma grande vontade de voltar a jogar full throttle (por que será, né?), e eu comecei a procurar uma forma de fazer isso.
Eu tenho o jogo (o CD-ROM mesmo) ripado no meu computador, e agora só faltava emular ele.

<p>Logo depois que eu comprei a minha
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/HIT3xHsxwbk29ZWpW4x0wA?feat=directlink">Dragstar 650</a>,
me deu uma grande vontade de voltar a jogar full throttle (por que será, né?), e
eu comecei a procurar uma forma de fazer isso.</p>
<p>Eu tenho o jogo (o CD-ROM mesmo) ripado no meu computador, e agora só faltava emular ele.</p>
<p>Procurando na internet eu achei o <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/">scummvm</a> que emula
os games da <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/">LucasArts</a> em várias plataformas! Baixei
o .deb e comecei a jogar no Ubuntu. Rodou bonitinho e estava gostando pra caramba!</p>
<p>Depois de jogar um pouco eu me toquei que eu não tenho tanto tempo para parar na
frente do computador e ficar jogando, e não é nada prático ficar levando meu
notebook para lá e para cá, portanto eu precisava de uma maneira mais portátil
de jogar o game, e consequentemente isso me levou a pensar em como fazer o game
funcionar no meu Android (um motorola milestone).</p>
<p>Procurando no <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/">site do scummvm eu encontrei um build para Android
(um .apk, bonitinho)</a>, mas ao tentar instalar no
Milestone ele não funcionou, devido as modificações na versão do NDK, pois a
versão oficial do build que está no site é um pouco antiga. :(</p>

eu <a href="http://anddev.at.ua/load/scummvm_svn55436/1-1-0-7">encontrei uma versão feita em cima de um commit mais recente</a>
do antigo svn (agora eles estão usando Git e o projeto está no
<a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> \o/) do scummvm.</p>
<p>Baixei o .apk e instalei no Android. Após algumas configurações do SDL tudo
funcionou beleza e o scummvm abriu bonitinho! Agora é só colocar o meu full
throttle ripado no SD e falar para o scummvm dar o load.</p>
<p>Seja bem vindo ao mundo dos polecats novamente! :D</p>

            <description>Bem, para introduzir um assunto sobre os meus Hobbies aqui no blog eu vou falar um pouco da minha história com motos. Eu nunca gostei da idéia de ter um veículo, mas na época que eu comecei a trabalhar mais longe e fazer faculdade eu estava gastando 4 horas diárias dentro de onibus, e isso estava me incomodando bastante, mesmo eu ouvindo podcasts todos os dias eu ainda considerava isso como tempo perdido.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bem, para introduzir um assunto sobre os meus Hobbies aqui no blog eu
vou falar um pouco da minha história com motos.  Eu nunca gostei da
idéia de ter um veículo, mas na época que eu comecei a trabalhar mais
longe e fazer faculdade eu estava gastando 4 horas diárias dentro de
onibus, e isso estava me incomodando bastante, mesmo eu ouvindo
podcasts todos os dias eu ainda considerava isso como tempo perdido.</p>
<p>No fim das contas eu me decidi que precisava ter um veículo! E como
naquela época eu já tinha noção que ter carro em SP é totalmente
inviável eu resolvi tirar carta de carro e moto (com 20 anos eu não
tinha carta&hellip;Dá para ver como eu não ligava nem um pouco para isso
:P), para poder comprar uma moto.</p>
<p>Após terminar todos os exames eu estava esperando a minha carteira de
habilitação chegar, e enquanto isso eu fui para a fase de escolher uma
moto para comprar.  Nessa época já era sabido que eu ia preferir uma
moto com modelo custom, mas eu não podia (nem achava sábio) comprar
uma moto grande para ser minha primeira moto, afinal, além de tudo, eu
nem sabia se eu ia gostar ou não.  Tendo isso em mente, eu fiquei em
duvida entre a Kansas da Dafra e a Intruder da Suzuki. As duas motos
são de baixa cilindrada (150 e 125 respectivamente).</p>
<p>Após muitas pesquisas fiquei com &ldquo;um pé atrás&rdquo; para pegar a Kansas
(apesar de achar ela mais bonita) e resolvi comprar uma Intruder por
que já tinha ouvido falar muito bem, além de ser da Suzuki.  E após
começar a passear de moto eu comecei a descobrir que eu realmente
gostava disso! E já estava pensando em customizar a minha intruder,
comprando alguns acessórios diferentes e tal. Após comprar o sissybar
(encosto para o passageiro) eu fiquei pensando que era melhor deixar
para investir na minha próxima moto, por que naquela época eu já
estava pensando em trocar após um ano para uma outra moto um pouco
maior.</p>
<p>Veja no meu album do Picasa as
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20100422Moto?feat=directlink">fotos da trudinha</a>.</p>
<p>Dois anos se passaram e a Intruder me ajudou bastante, sempre me
levando para o meu destino com rapidez e me dando pouco custo de
manutenção (em torno de 20 reais por semana de gasolina e uns 30 por
mês de manutenção periódica dos quase 1000km que eu rodo mensalmente).</p>
<p>Nesses dois anos eu me tornei um motociclista mais hábil e agora
estava preparado para comprar uma moto maior.  Por um tempo eu tentei
dropar a idéia de pegar uma moto maior, por vários motivos, sendo o
maior deles o custo x benefício. E atrasei a idéia por vários meses,
mesmo sempre estando com ela na cabeça.</p>
<p>Eis que no final do ano passado eu resolvi olhar o preço das Dragstars
(que sempre foi o meu sonho de consumo) e fiquei louco para comprar
uma, portanto aproveitei essa loucura para parar de pensar em custo, e
tudo mais para comprar, por que se eu não me enganasse eu não comprava
mais :)</p>
<p>Depois de muita cotação eu comprei uma Dragstar 650 com apenas 9000km
rodados, e totalmente original.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/Monstro?feat=directlink">fotos do monstro também estão no Picasa</a>.</p>
<p>A sensação de pilotar essa moto é completamente diferente da Intruder,
inclusive o sentimento, não gosto de pilotar ela na correria do dia a
dia, e sim quando eu quero realmente aproveitar todo o trajeto que eu
estou fazendo.</p>
<p>Enfim, esse foi só um post para introduzir essa &ldquo;seção&rdquo; do blog, que é
um dos meus Hobbies :)</p>

            <description>Pois é! Essa era uma das coisas que eu tinha vontade de fazer há muito tempo, mas não queria ir de Intruder 125, e agora o momento chegou. :)
Depois que comprei o monstro (apelido da minha Dragstar 650), a vontade de viajar de moto aumentou muito, afinal, montar sobre 650cc com 40HP para andar por bairro é zuado! :P
Aproveitei o natal e fui com uns amigos para Itanhaém, eu sozinho na moto e eles de carro.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pois é! Essa era uma das coisas que eu tinha vontade de fazer há muito tempo,
mas não queria ir de Intruder 125, e agora o momento chegou. :)</p>
<p>Depois que comprei o monstro (apelido da minha Dragstar 650), a vontade de
viajar de moto aumentou muito, afinal, montar sobre 650cc com 40HP para andar
por bairro é zuado! :P</p>
<p>Aproveitei o natal e fui com uns amigos para Itanhaém, eu sozinho na moto e eles
de carro. Curti bastante a viagem, e foi muito bom para descabaçar de pegar a
estrada, mesmo que seguindo um carro!</p>
<p>Essa viagem me rendeu <a href="http://twitpic.com/3jxu1p">uma foto bem legal</a>, e foi a
oportunidade de ver como o monstro se comporta em uma velocidade mais elevada
(cheguei a 145km/h em uma reta e reduzi depois, não curto correr muito, mas
precisava testar).</p>
<p>Depois de ter feito uma viagem sozinho é a hora de procurar uma viagem em grupo!
Para isso estava acompanhando o fórum dos (novos) amigos do
<a href="http://dragstaronline.livreforum.com/forum">DragstarOnline</a>, do qual faço parte
antes mesmo de comprar a moto, e já estava me sentindo um dos DOGs (Dragstar
Owners Group :P).</p>
<p>Acompanhando sempre o fórum eu encontrei a oportunidade de fazer o primeiro
passeio com a galera! No dia 23 de Janeiro de 2011 marcaram um BV (bate e volta)
para Peruíbe! Lá vou eu para o primeiro ponto de encontro (no Frango Assado da
Imigrantes) as 8:00 da manhã do domingão!</p>
<p>No fim das contas esse primeiro passeio em grupo foi algo meio surreal para mim!
Encontrar pessoas que ainda não conhecia pessoalmente, em um lugar que nunca
tinha ido para ir para outro que só tinha uma vaga noção de onde era. Se sentir
parte do grupo em poucos segundos de conversa, como se o pessoal me conhecesse
há vários anos.</p>
<p>Atualmente eu tenho visto tantas pessoas escrotas por aí que quando eu encontro
um grupo de pessoas legais até parece que é um universo paralelo, e eu estou
literalmente viajando nesse mundo &ldquo;novo&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ao se preparar para sair, após alinhar as motos, é muito legal ouvir todos os
escapamentos roncando ao mesmo tempo construindo aquela sinfonia que precede um
grande evento.
Partir com os amigos pela estrada mantendo a formação e repassando os gestos
para alertar os companheiros que te seguem.</p>
<p>Encontrar no transito olhares curiosos e admirados das crianças dentro dos
carros, mas não apenas delas, outras pessoas que fotografam e acenam de dentro
dos carros ou do acostamento da estrada.</p>
<p>Se tornar atração do nosso destino na hora da nossa chegada e observar os
olhares incrédulos ou curiosos das pessoas que observam atentamente 15 motos
tentando se endireitar em um estacionamento esquisito.</p>
<p>Ter algumas horas para bater papo com os novos amigos e aproveitar a paisagem
até o momento de alinhar novamente para voltar para casa.</p>
<p>Enfim, o que eu posso dizer é que viajar de moto com um grupo de motociclistas é
algo muito foda, e esse primeiro passeio com certeza não será o ultimo! :)</p>

            <description>Como muitos sabem, eu sou meio doido por organização (heheh) e eu mesmo não gosto de ficar lendo coisas que não me interessam de outros blogs, ou seja, no blog de alguém que gosta bastante de Vim eu ter que ficar lendo sobre paraquedismo :P
Agora eu gostaria de além de escrever sobre coisas técnicas, escrever também sobre os meus outros hobbies, como Motos, Shows e etc. Alguns deles eu até já escrevia um pouco antes, mas nem tanto, e isso já me incomodava um pouco, por que eu sei bem que várias pessoas que seguem o feed não gostam das mesmas coisas que eu.</description>

incomodava um pouco, por que eu sei bem que várias pessoas que seguem

<p>Então minha idéia foi simples, criei um feed só para os posts técnicos
(programação, Vim, eventos de tech, e coisas relacionadas), e o que eu
achar que não é tech eu não coloco a tag.</p>
<p>Portanto, se você só quer ver os posts técnicos do meu blog, assine
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech" title="">este feed</a>, e o feed atual
começa a ser o &ldquo;FULL&rdquo; onde terá todos os posts. :)</p>
<p>Se você não liga para só ler posts técnicos e quer ler tudo que eu
colocar, é só ignorar isso tudo :)</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://pothix.com/posts/ambiente-dev/</guid>
            <description>Fui convidado pelo @jtadeulopes e pelo @qmx para participar do meme sobre ambientes de desenvolvimento, então estou fazendo esse post para falar um pouco mais sobre o meu.
Sistema Operacional Já usei Windows um bom tempo atrás, e agora tenho um pós-conceito para usar (preconceito é só quando vc não conhece), não vejo nenhuma vantagem para utilizar ele e acho que não vale o preço (tenho um Vista e um Win7 originais que ganhei na compra do notebook e na CampusParty e nem uso).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fui convidado pelo <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jtadeulopes">@jtadeulopes</a> e
pelo <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/qmx">@qmx</a> para participar do meme sobre
ambientes de desenvolvimento, então estou fazendo esse post para falar
um pouco mais sobre o meu.</p>
<h4 id="sistema-operacional">Sistema Operacional</h4>
<p>Já usei Windows um bom tempo atrás, e agora tenho um pós-conceito para
usar (preconceito é só quando vc não conhece), não vejo nenhuma
vantagem para utilizar ele e acho que não vale o preço (tenho um Vista
e um Win7 originais que ganhei na compra do notebook e na CampusParty
e nem uso).</p>
<p>Já usei Slackware (e ainda tenho ele instalado no meu notebook para
brincar de vez em quando) e atualmente estou utilizando só o Ubuntu,
que me fornece um ótimo ambiente para desenvolvimento. Acho muito
fácil instalar coisas novas para dev com o Ubuntu, e tudo se encaixa
muito bem com esse SO.</p>
<h4 id="controles-de-versão">Controles de Versão</h4>
<p>Já utilizei um pouco de SVN, Mercurial e Bazaar, mas não o suficiente
para falar bem ou mal de qualquer um deles, por que quando eu utilizei
eles supriram a minha necessidade tão bem quanto o Git.  Atualmente
utilizo muito o Git, que eu acho fantástico, e a cada hora que vou
utilizando eu descubro coisas novas que me surpreeendem.  Não utilizo
nada gráfico para o Git, apenas linha de comando, afinal, do que mais
eu preciso!? :D</p>
<h4 id="linguagens-de-programação">Linguagens de Programação</h4>
<p>Gosto de brincar com várias linguagens e sempre estou mexendo um pouco
com Python e Javascript. Já faz um tempo que eu não brinco com C++,
mas é outra linguagem que eu gosto bastante também.</p>
<p>Algum tempo atrás brinquei um pouco com desenvolvimento de aplicações
para Android e para isso tive que brincar um pouco com Java também :).
Mas como todos sabem, a linguagem de programação que eu mais uso
atualmente é Ruby, que uso no trabalho e para alguns projetinhos
pessoais.</p>
<h4 id="editor-de-texto--ide">Editor de texto / IDE</h4>
<p>Eu uso o único editor de texto que uma pessoa em plena sanidade
poderia usar, ou seja, o VIM! heheheh :D</p>
<p>Saindo da trollagem e voltando as vantagens, eu gosto do Vim por que
ele é um editor rápido, customizável, e me faz pensar a todo
momento. Para mim é estar resolvendo puzzles a cada minuto, acho
divertido ficar pensando em como eu poderia estar editando aquele
texto de uma forma mais divertida, e consequentemente, quanto mais eu
aprendo a editar textos de uma maneira melhor mais rápido eu vou
ficando para editá-los.</p>
<p>Claro que não é viável utilizar o Vim para tudo (apesar de eu estar
escrevendo esse post por ele&hellip;heheh), e para algumas coisas é mais
viável utilizar uma IDE. Para desenvolvimento de apps para o Android
por exemplo, é muito mais fácil desenvolver utilizando o Eclipse que
já tem plugin que ajuda em algumas tarefas, e é Java&hellip;Não preciso
dizer mais nada.</p>
<h4 id="musica">Musica</h4>
<p>Sempre estou com meu player aberto ouvindo musica, e sempre estou ouvindo coisas diferentes, começo com um random na minha lib inteira e escolho uma banda nesse meio para ouvir.
Eu tenho uma playlist das musicas que eu mais curto para ouvir nos dias que não estou afim de ficar ouvindo coisas aleatórias.
Já testei diversos players no Linux (banshee, amarok e etc), e atualmente estou utilizando o Rhythmbox, que reconhece meu Ipod e posso ouvir sempre a mesma lib em casa e no trabalho.</p>
<p>Se quiser saber as musicas que eu ouço veja <a href="http://last.fm/user/pothix">meu last.fm</a>.</p>
<h4 id="ims">IMs</h4>
<p>Geralmente fico logado em mais de 6 contas de IM (2 Gtalks pessoais, 1
Jabber da empresa, 2 contas de IRC, 1 conta de Skype e ainda tem o
softphone).  Parece ser meio bizarro ficar logado em tudo isso todo o
tempo, mas eu só consigo essa proeza por que as pessoas que eu tenho
nos IMs são inteligentes o suficiente para olhar o meu status e não em
encher quando não devem, caso não eu não possa falar apenas aviso e
pronto.  Em casos que preciso de bastante concentração eu fecho quase
todos, deixando apenas uma conta que tem só algumas pessoas
adicionadas :)</p>
<p>Só para constar, se você usa MSN isso não funciona, por que se a
pessoa usa MSN ela já não tem nenhuma noção.</p>
<h4 id="terminal">Terminal</h4>
<p>Aqui é onde eu passo 90% do meu tempo de trabalho, utilizando linha de
comando, Vim (não uso interface gráfica para ele também&hellip;Não faz
sentido para mim), Git e scripts em geral.  Atualmente eu uso o
gnome-terminal do Ubuntu, que não deixa a desejar. :)</p>
<h4 id="organização">Organização</h4>
<p>Eu sou meio bizarro quanto a organização, e no meu ambiente tudo tem
que ficar em seu devido lugar, assim, cada atalho de teclado me leva
onde eu sei que as coisas estão.  No trabalho tenho 2 monitores e 4
areas de trabalho, sendo que fica organizado assim:</p>
<ol>
<li>Um browser em cada monitor</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Firefox com Vimperator na esquerda com 3 abas com páginas que eu uso no sistema que eu trabalho atualmente</li>
<li>Chrome no monitor da esquerda com 2 e-mails, todoist e pivotal tracker</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Todos os IMs e um terminal</li>
<li>Dois terminais, um em cada monitor com projetos auxiliares</li>
<li>Dois terminais, os dois abertos com o projeto que estou trabalhando</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>No terminal da direita deixo uma aba com Rails server, uma com Rails console e uma para o Vim</li>
<li>No terminal da esquerda rodo testes e outras coisas</li>
</ul>
<p>Tem várias outras coisas que uso (como o Notecase para tomar notas por
exemplo) mas acho que isso ae já é uma visão geral :D</p>
<p>Agora eu passo a bola para o

            <description>Na semana passada (semana do dia 24 ao dia 30 de outubro) foi uma semana de grandes eventos, que eu tive o prazer de participar de todos! :)
Rubyconf Brasil A Rubyconf Brasil é o Antigo Rails Summit Latin America, que acontecia no centro de convenções do Anhembi, e agora mudou sua localização para o centro de convenções Frei Caneca, para diminuir os custos e prover um local mais acessível para os participantes (próximo ao metrô e a avenida paulista).</description>

<h4 id="rubyconf-brasil">Rubyconf Brasil</h4>
<p>A <a href="www.rubyconf.com.br">Rubyconf Brasil</a> é o Antigo Rails Summit Latin
America, que acontecia no centro de convenções do Anhembi, e agora
mudou sua localização para o centro de convenções Frei Caneca, para
diminuir os custos e prover um local mais acessível para os
participantes (próximo ao metrô e a avenida paulista).</p>
<p>O evento foi muito bom, contando com mais de 20 palestras com um
número bem equilibrado de palestrantes nacionais e internacionais, que
ministraram muitas palestras com ótimo conteúdo técnico.  Infelizmente
o evento teve problemas com WIFI, e os participantes mal conseguiram
acessar a internet utilizando a infra do evento.</p>
<p>Algumas palestras:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A palestra do <strong>Jim Weiric</strong> sobre SOLID Ruby foi fantástica! Além dele ser um ótimo orador, muito divertido, mostrou conceitos bem interessante e algumas comparações com outras linguagens. Uma das melhores palestras do evento.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O <a href="http://github.com/tenderlove">tenderlove</a> mandou muito bem na sua palestra sobre Fibers e ruby 1.9. Além das corriqueiras brincadeiras com fotos sobre a suposta criação da palestra, ele mostrou um conteúdo muito interessante, com muitos exemplos préviamente contruídos para demonstrar o conceito de Fibers. Uma palestra densa mas muito boa! :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O <a href="http://github.com/josevalim">José Valim</a> palestrou sobre Rails 3 e mostrou algumas das novas funcionalidades e também o que estar por vir, e como sempre deixou a dica para a galera contribuir, &ldquo;as próximas features depende de vocês&rdquo; :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O <a href="http://github.com/wycats">Yehuda Katz</a> fez uma palestra bem interessante sobre como melhorar a performance da sua aplicação movendo muito de sua lógica para o cliente, e apresentou um projeto que ele está trabalhando atualmente. Gostei do conceito, mesmo pensando que não é um conceito para aplicar para qualquer aplicação web, mas para um aplicação com muitos acessos faz muitos sentido e o modelo parece bom. :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O pessoal da Caelum <a href="http://github.com/andersonleite">Anderson Leite</a> e <a href="http://github.com/guilhermesilveira">Guilherme Silveira</a> apresentaram sobre como utilizar uma Ruby funcionalmente, e a palestra foi muito boa, apesar de ser bem densa e os dois falarem rápido</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tiveram outras ótimas palestras, sobre encoding do Ruby (que é bizarro
assim como qualquer outra implementação de encoding), integração de
redes sociais, redis e resque e etc. Não vou falar de todas aqui para
o post não ficar muito grande, mas aconselho a ficar de olho nas
notícias pois a <a href="www.locaweb.com.br">Locaweb</a> filmou o evento e
provavelmente vão liberar os vídeos das palestras, e quando isso
acontecer, aconselho você a assistir! :)</p>
<p>E é claro que nesse evento também teve um espaço para a
desconferência, onde apareceram algumas outras apresentações legais
(cômicas ou não), sobre assuntos derivados, como: node.js, deploy
continuo, programando algo parecido com Ruby para Java, e etc! Foi bem
divertido também!</p>
<p>Além de tudo isso ainda temos que contar o networking com a galera que
foi fantástico, rever velhos amigos que quase nunca vemos (a galera da
<a href="http://www.fande.com.br">Fande</a> e do Ikwa
(<a href="http://twitter.com/mateuslinhares">@mateuslinhares</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/danielaltman">@danielaltman</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/jorge_silveira">@jorge_silveira</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/willian">@willian</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/_bojak">@_bojak</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/rafaeltimbo">@rafaeltimbo</a> e
<a href="http://twitter.com/vitormateus">@vitormateus</a>) por exemplo),
reencontrar o pessoal do <a href="http://www.guru-sp.org">Guru-SP</a> que apesar
de encontrar sempre é legal reunir toda a galera e foi mais um
encontro :), e ainda tem mais um monte de gente que encontrei por lá,
e isso fora as pessoas que conheci! Enfim&hellip;Networking #FTW! :).</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20101026Rubyconf?feat=directlink">Minhas fotos do evento</a></p>
<h4 id="android-dev-lab">Android Dev Lab</h4>
<p>Eu sinceramente esperava que o Google fosse dar um Nexus One para a
galera assim como eles fizeram na OSCon lá fora, mas obviamente me
enganei :P.  No fim das contas o evento foi razoável, apesar dos
problemas com WIFI (que já é corriqueiro&hellip;), foi interessante para
conhecer um pouco do SDK, principalmente para quem não ia no Google
Developers Day no dia seguinte (o que não foi o meu caso), e para
ganhar uma camiseta bonitinha do Android :P</p>
<p><strong>Resumo</strong>: Foi legal mas eu esperava mais.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20101028AndroidDevLab?feat=directlink">Minhas fotos do evento</a></p>
<h4 id="google-developers-day">Google Developers Day</h4>
<p>Para compensar o Android Dev Lab o GDD foi um evento fantástico! Muito
mais gente (como era de se esperar) poucos lugares nas palestras
principais, mas um ótimo conteúdo de palestras (se você souber
escolher bem :D).</p>
<p>Algumas palestras:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Para mim foi quase um Tim Bray Developers Day, por que eu assisti 3 palestras do Tim Bray, todas sobre Android, direta ou indiretamente. Gostei de todas, o Tim falou muito bem sobre os temas que escolheu. Deu uma boa visão sobre design de aplicações, sobre o Android em si (algumas coisas eu já tinha visto no dia anterior&hellip;), e mostrou por que eles seguem algumas filosofias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uma frase que ele falou que eu ia mencionar no twitter na hora mas não ia caber, e resolvi deixar para (trollar aqui n)o post:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;O Android Market não precisa de moderação por que sabemos que as pessoas são inteligentes e caso uma aplicação não seja boa ou pareça maliciosa, eles simplesmente não instalam e não usam&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A palestra sobre Desenvolvimento de extensões para o Chrome foi bem legal e mostrou como é simples desenvolver uma extensão e como ele consegue acesso fácil ao chrome apenas utilizando Javascript. E o mais engraçado é que o desenvolvedor do Chromed Bird fez uma pequena apresentação mostrando a extensão dele e ele tinha uma direct message com um link para um twit meu. Vai saber :P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achei que a palestra sobre HTML5 seria a mesmice de sempre, mas aprendi muita coisa interessante com ela! Não sabia que agora existem buscas no estilo jQuery nativamente no Javascript. Algo como .search('#id') (não é esse método, mas existe), fora as dicas que ele deu e os exemplos que ele mostrou que valeram a pena. Vou procurar a apresentação dele na internet depois para dar uma olhada novamente, e se eu encontrar atualizo o post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Novamente, teve outras palestras legais, mas essas são as que eu
lembro, e aproveitei! :)</p>
<p>Nesse evento também encontrei velhos amigos como o <a href="http://twitter.com/dalembertian">Rubens
Altimari</a> da
<a href="http://www.whitehat.com.br">Whitehat</a> empresa que eu já tive o prazer
de trabalhar, e meu amigo <a href="http://www.twitter.com/brunoassis">Bruno
Assis</a> que sempre marcamos de
conversar e nunca nos encontramos :P.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20101029GoogleDevelopersDay2010?feat=directlink">Minhas fotos do evento</a></p>
<h4 id="resumo">Resumo</h4>
<p>Foi uma semana <strong>Muito</strong> cansativa, fazia tempo que eu não ficava tão
cansado assim. Entre um evento e outro teve as minhas seções de
fisioterapia (para curar umas dores nas costas devido a uma queda), e
também trabalhei bastante para compensar os eventos (e o mais legal é
que foi uma parte divertida do trabalho para fazer!).</p>
<p>No fim das contas, tudo isso valeu muito a pena, aprendi bastante,
conheci pessoas, revi outras pessoas, consegui manter o fluxo do meu
trabalho, e descansei no final da semana! Portanto&hellip; Vitória! :D</p>

            <description>Nesse post eu vou falar um pouco de como foi atualizar a aplicação que eu trabalho atualmente para Rails3.
Em uma segunda feira eu tive a brilhante ideia de aproveitar que as tasks que eu estava fazendo estavam dependentes de algumas coisas que ainda não estavam feitas, e resolvi começar a atualizar a aplicação para Rails3 só para saber o trabalho que ia dar, e no final do dia eu já tinha feito todas as alterações necessárias para o boot da aplicação e para rodar a suite de testes (não fazer os testes passar, apenas rodar!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nesse post eu vou falar um pouco de como foi atualizar a aplicação que
eu trabalho atualmente para Rails3.</p>
<p>Em uma segunda feira eu tive a brilhante ideia de aproveitar que as
tasks que eu estava fazendo estavam dependentes de algumas coisas que
ainda não estavam feitas, e resolvi começar a atualizar a aplicação
para Rails3 só para saber o trabalho que ia dar, e no final do dia eu
já tinha feito todas as alterações necessárias para o boot da
aplicação e para rodar a suite de testes (não fazer os testes passar,
apenas rodar!).  Depois disso foi mais 1 dia para fazer todos os
testes passar, e mais alguns outros testando a aplicação e resolvendo
pequenos problemas de safe html e derivados.</p>
<h4 id="dicas-para-fazer-a-conversão-do-código">Dicas para fazer a conversão do código</h4>
<h5 id="tenha-testes">Tenha testes</h5>
<p>Se não tiver testes, esqueça essa idéia e pare de ler o post, a menos
que você queira quebrar sua app em produção.</p>
<h5 id="faça-sua-aplicação-e-suite-de-testes-funcionar">Faça sua aplicação e suite de testes funcionar</h5>
<p>Primeiramente, se você ainda não conhece, vale a pena dar uma olhada
no plugin chamado Rails Upgrade que te dá um guideline do que você
precisa ir alterando para tornar sua aplicação compatível com Rails 3.
Esse plugin faz algumas coisas como criar o application.rb baseado no
seu environment, te dar alguns guias das configurações que mudaram e
tenta converter suas rotas para o novo padrão (vide próximo tópico) O
primeiro passo a se tomar é utilizar o plugin (ou não, pode fazer
manualmente também) e trocar as coisas principais para que sua
aplicação pelo menos passe pela etapa de boot.  Quando passar por esse
passo vá para seus testes, e se for RSpec prepare-se para ter alguns
problemas de conversão, por que algumas coisas mudaram do RSpec 1 para
o RSpec 2, e você vai ter que lidar com os problemas de atualização
dos seus testes tambem. A maioria das coisas que tive problemas foi
com métodos que não existem mais como o have_tag por exemplo.</p>
<h5 id="não-use-o-rails-upgrade-para-a-conversão-das-rotas">Não use o Rails Upgrade para a conversão das rotas</h5>
<p>Como disse acima, esse plugin é um ótimo guia, mas tome cuidado com
ele como solução final. Você pode dizer para ele converter suas rotas,
mas tome cuidado, por que dependendo da forma que as suas rotas estão
diagramadas o resultado que ele dá não é muito conciso. O que eu fiz
foi utilizar a conversão dele apenas como estudo para saber como está
a nova syntax e refiz o arquivo de rotas do zero.</p>
<h5 id="pare-de-usar-remarkable">Pare de usar remarkable</h5>
<p>Eu sempre gostei de usar Remarkable para testar relacionamentos,
validações e etc, mas remarkable no Rails 3 é uma grande porcaria. Os
desenvolvedores que começaram o projeto ficaram sem tempo para o mesmo
e deixaram na mão de outros, que não tem a mesma qualidade ou
preocupação com o projeto, portanto, a menos que você queira ser o
novo mantenedor do projeto e fazer as alterações necessárias para que
funcione bem no Rails 3, fuja dele agora.  O que eu fiz foi começar a
usar o Shoulda para algumas coisas que me convinham, como por exemplo
testes de relacionamento e validações. Para quem estiver interessado
em fazer essa migração, eu fiz grande parte das trocas do que eu usava
(validações e relacionamentos) facinho com grep e sed! Fiz <a href="http://gist.github.com/640517">um
Gist</a> disso.</p>
<h5 id="evite-dependencias">Evite dependencias</h5>
<p>Assim como o remarkable acima, cada outra gem/plugin que você está
utilizando pode ter problemas com o Rails 3, portanto, antes de fazer
a migração procure manter o menor número possível de dependencias no
seu projeto, e as que você tiver veja se já possui uma versão
funcional para Rails 3, e se não possuir você já pode se voluntariar
para fazer ;).</p>
<h5 id="use-o-sufixo-_html-nos-locales-necessários">Use o sufixo _html nos locales necessários</h5>
<p>Suponho que as aplicações Rails estão usando os formatos de
internacionalização do Rails, portanto suas string não estão perdidas
pelas Views, Controllers e Models e sim estão em seus devidos arquivos
de locale.  Levando esse cenário óbvio em conta lembre-se de que você
não precisa dar raw em toda mensagem que possui HTML por que Rails já
faz isso para você quando você adiciona o sufixo _html na sua chave de
locale. Exemplo:</p>
<pre><code>not_yet: &quot;**Ainda não**&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Ficaria:</p>
<pre><code>not_yet_html: &quot;**Ainda não**&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>E assim ele não vai escapar automaticamente o HTML dessa chave.</p>
<h5 id="vá-lidando-aos-poucos-com-deprecation-warning">Vá lidando aos poucos com DEPRECATION WARNING</h5>
<p>Quando você rodar sua suite de testes pela primeira vez já vai ser
bombardeado por uma quantidade monstra de _DEPRECATION WARNING_s, mas
não saia atacando eles de uma vez, primeiramente tenha em mente fazer
sua aplicação funcionar e você vai corrigir esses probleminhas aos
poucos enquanto estiver corrigindo os erros ou desenvolvendo coisas
novas.  Felizmente a API do ActiveRecord não deixou de funcionar,
portanto você ainda não vai precisar fazer grandes modificações para a
nova syntax utilizando Arel por enquanto, o que vai tornar a migração
menos dolorosa e você pode migrar aos poucos enquanto seu código já
estiver rodando.</p>
<h4 id="dicas-de-organização-para-a-migração">Dicas de organização para a migração</h4>
<h5 id="crie-um-branch-separado-e-altere-aos-poucos">Crie um branch separado e altere aos poucos</h5>
<p>Sim! Todos queríamos que toda a equipe parasse por alguns dias e fosse
alterar o projeto para funcionar com Rails 3, mas todos sabemos que
isso não é possível na realidade de ninguém. Então uma coisa legal
para se fazer (principalmente quando se está trabalhando com controle
de versão distribuído, onde branches não são tão penosos) é criar um
branch e manter uma pessoa trabalhando nele enquanto os outros vão
tocando o projeto, sempre com muita comunicação para evitar que as
pessoas criem cada vez mais código legado que precisará ser migrado,
até que chegue uma hora que você possa voltar para o master e ficar
sem deploy por alguns poucos dias para que a aquipe termine o trabalho
e faça alguns testes.</p>
<h5 id="ataque-um-problema-de-cada-vez">Ataque um problema de cada vez</h5>
<p>Acho muito legal a combinação Rails + Ruby1.9, mas acho que as coisas
ficam bem mais fáceis quando atacamos no estilo estripador (por
partes), assim você tem um caminho a menos para analizar de onde vem o
possível erro, e assim que terminar uma migração para Rails 3 já pode
começar uma para Ruby 1.9 e ver o que vai quebrar apenas para essa
implementação específica.</p>
<h5 id="use-seu-ambiente-de-homologação">Use seu ambiente de homologação</h5>
<p>Não sei como seu deploy funciona atualmente, mas talvez com a migração
você precise alterar ele e é na hora que você for colocar no seu
ambiente de homologação que você vai descobrir isso, portanto, use-o
bem! :)</p>
<h4 id="conclusão-e-saldo-final">Conclusão e Saldo final</h4>
<p>Fazer a migração para o Rails 3 foi mais simples do que eu imaginei,
mas mesmo assim tomou vários dias para a conclusão.  Nos meus calculos
levou mais ou menos 2 dias só meus e uns 3 dias meus e de outro
desenvolvedor, isso contando os problemas de merge e etc. Portanto
acho que em 1 semana é possível migrar uma aplicação bem coberta por
testes sem grandes problemas e sem precisar parar a sua equipe inteira
por um grande período. Escolha aquela semana com um feriado e atualize
sua aplicação. :)</p>

            <description>Quem me conhece sabe como eu sou meio doido quanto a ler coisas aleatórias (Google reader e artigos interessantes que eu acho perdidos por aí), e como eu tenho um tempo um pouco limitado, devido ao trabalho e a faculdade eu sempre tenho alguns esquemas diferentes para ler. :P
Fluxo de leitura Depois que eu comprei um Android o meu fluxo de leitura se modificou um pouco. E está da seguinte maneira:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quem me conhece sabe como eu sou meio doido quanto a ler coisas
aleatórias (Google reader e artigos interessantes que eu acho perdidos
por aí), e como eu tenho um tempo um pouco limitado, devido ao
trabalho e a faculdade eu sempre tenho alguns esquemas diferentes para
ler. :P</p>
<h4 id="fluxo-de-leitura">Fluxo de leitura</h4>
<p>Depois que eu comprei um Android o meu fluxo de leitura se modificou
um pouco. E está da seguinte maneira:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aproveito o café da manhã para dar uma revisada no meu Google Reader pelo celular, colocando estrela nos artigos que me interessam</li>
<li>Termino de separar os artigos e colocar estrela nos que me interessam e marcar como lido os que não interessam</li>
<li>Leio os artigos pequenos que estão com estrela e os artigos maiores vão para o Android</li>
</ul>
<p>E com isso eu consigo pegar meus &ldquo;tempos livres&rdquo; para ler um pouco
desses artigos aos poucos.</p>
<h4 id="aplicações-para-android">Aplicações para Android</h4>
<p>Quando comprei o celular já estava pensando em conseguir aplicações
legais para leitura justamente para ajudar a resolver esse meu
&ldquo;problema&rdquo;, portanto fui atrás logo cedo.  Minha primeira idéia era
simplesmente colocar um .pdf no Android e ler em qualquer leitor de
PDF normal, como o quickoffice ou até mesmo o adobereader para
Android.</p>
<p>Seguindo o caminho PDF eu descobri que é um pouco desconfortável ficar
lendo PDFs em uma tela pequena, e vc precisa ficar fazendo scroll com
frequencia, dar zoom e etc, e isso deixa a leitura meio enfadonha
(sempre quis usar essa palavra :P).  Então decidi seguir outro rumo
não muito comum, vou transformar esses artigos em .epub e ler em um
leitor de epubs para Android.  Os dois leitores legais que eu
encontrei foram:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.reader.books.laputa.ui">Laputa</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.aldiko.android">Aldiko</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Primeiramente tentei algo com o <strong>Laputa</strong> que parecia um iBooks para
Android. Todo cheio de frescuras de desenhar quando você está virando
a página para parecer um livro e tal, mas eu prefiro as coisas mais
simples :).</p>
<p>Ao mesmo tempo já estava testando o <strong>Aldiko</strong> tambem e comparando
funcionalidades. O Aldiko tinha as mesmas funcionalidades só que com
menos frescuras e algumas coisas a mais que realmente fazem a
diferença, como o ajuste de brilho tocando o lado esquerdo da tela,
por exemplo.</p>
<p>E no fim das contas acabei decidindo usar o <strong>Aldiko</strong> como meu leitor
padrão, por ter boas funcionalidades e não ter frescuras. Mas depois
disso ainda tinha um problema para resolver&hellip;Tinha que transformar em
.epub e colocar no Android toda vez que eu quisesse ler um texto nele,
e isso provavelmente ia ser uma tarefa muito chata&hellip;Se não fosse o
<strong>Calibre</strong>! :D</p>
<h4 id="calibre">Calibre</h4>
<p>O <strong>Calibre</strong> é uma aplicação para organização de ebooks que provê uma
maneira fácil para editar metatags e exportar para diversos formatos.</p>
<p>A ultima versão (se vc usa Ubuntu, não instale por apt-get que a
versão é antiga, <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux">instale diretamente do
site</a>) reconhece
perfeitamente o meu Milestone e envia para a pasta eBooks/import, que
é a pasta que o Aldiko usa para importar ebooks! :D</p>
<p>Portanto, utilizando essas ferramentas ficou muito fácil de seguir o
meu fluxo de leitura:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ler um artigo com estrela</li>
<li>Se for grande imprimir em pdf (geralmente uso um plugin do Chrome chamado iReader, que formata muito bem para leitura/impressão)</li>
<li>converter o .pdf para .epub no calibre e já enviar direto para o Android</li>
<li>no Aldiko importar os novos livros</li>
</ul>
<p>E pronto! Agora tenho os artigos que eu quero ler em boa fonte, como
se fosse um ebook comum! :)</p>
<p>Espero que seja útil para mais alguem.</p>

            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/motorola-milestone/</link>

            <description>Muita gente tem me perguntado sobre o meu Android atual, um motorola Milestone, e resolvi postar algumas informações e opiniões sobre o aparelho e sobre o Android em si.
Primeiramente, gostaria de dizer que o Android é um sistema muito bom, e estou bastante satisfeito com as features, apps, SDK e etc.
Milestone É um aparelho bem legal e na minha opinião é o Android mais &amp;ldquo;custo X benefício&amp;rdquo; do Brasil.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Muita gente tem me perguntado sobre o meu Android atual, um motorola
Milestone, e resolvi postar algumas informações e opiniões sobre o
aparelho e sobre o Android em si.</p>
<p>Primeiramente, gostaria de dizer que o Android é um sistema muito bom,
e estou bastante satisfeito com as features, apps, SDK e etc.</p>
<h4 id="milestone">Milestone</h4>
<p>É um aparelho bem legal e na minha opinião é o Android mais &ldquo;custo X
benefício&rdquo; do Brasil. Tem um hardware bom o bastante (processador 600
Mhz e 256 de RAM), que já dá para rodar alguns joguinhos legais e
deixar o telefone com uma boa usabilidade.</p>
<p>Uma coisa que me agrada muito no telefone é o teclado qwerty físico,
por que eu sempre estou conversando com alguém no Gtalk ou escrevendo
algumas outras coisas, e eu tenho certeza que iria passar muita raiva
com o teclado virtual (apesar de estar gostando do teclado virtual do
Milestone quando está no modo horizontal).</p>
<p>A comparação do Milestone com o Nexus One dá uma grande diferença de
performance, sendo que o Nexus vence por uma boa diferença (tem
processador de 1Gb e memória de 512), mas como eu já disse antes, o
Milestone é um ótimo custo X benefício para quem nunca teve um Android
e quer uma linha &ldquo;poderosa&rdquo; :D</p>
<h4 id="android">Android</h4>
<p>O Milestone em particular vem com o Android 2.1, e a Motorola promete
o Froyo (Android 2.2) para o primeiro trimestre de 2011.  Uma pequena</p>
<p>lista de vantagens legais do Android:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download de aplicações legais facilmente pelo Android Market</li>
<li>Muitas aplicações de qualidade no Android Market com Rating e comentários dos próprios usuários</li>
<li>Api de desenvolvimento bem legal e multiplataforma</li>
<li>Integração fantástica com os serviços do Google, até comecei a usar alguns que eu não usava só por que é <em>MUITO</em> bom.</li>
<li>Multitasking de verdadinha</li>
<li>Sua liberdade continua intacta</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="problemas">Problemas</h4>
<p>Tenho visto pouquíssimos problemas no Milestone. O unico que eu vi até
hoje foi um reboot do celular enquanto eu estava jogando, mas acho que
eu exagerei um pouco no multitasking (para quem não sabe o Android tem
um multitasking real, portanto, você precisa fechar algumas apps de
vez em quando, por que elas ficam rodando em background)</p>
<h4 id="considerações">Considerações</h4>
<p>Eu recomendo muito comprar um Android, e o que eu recomendo atualmente
no Brasil é o Milestone, por que você consegue sentir um gostinho do
que o Android pode fazer sem gastar tanto assim.</p>
<p>Para quem tem ou está pensando em ter um Android, pode aproveitar para
dar uma lida na <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1ZtMGH-HZvNTjprVPpAcxhKr19FJ6ReFaJ_YFmtt0Z_4">lista de aplicações
legais</a>
que eu estou mantendo com uns amigos.</p>

            <description>Hoje terminei de ler o livro da 37signals chamado Rework! E vou falar um pouco sobre a idéia dele aqui.
Atualmente eu fiz uma compra na Amazon em conjunto com uns amigos (@vinibaggio, @hugobarauna, @cantoniodasilva), e cogitei a compra do Rework, mas depois de uma pergunta no Twitter e algumas respostas sobre a idéia do livro eu resolvi não comprar, pois parecia muito gerencial, e acabei optando por outros (Design Patterns In Ruby, Ruby Programming Language, The Pragmatic Programmer), que falarei em outros posts :P.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hoje terminei de ler o livro da 37signals chamado Rework! E vou falar

<p>Atualmente eu fiz uma compra na Amazon em conjunto com uns amigos
(<a href="http://twitter.com/vinibaggio">@vinibaggio</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/hugobarauna">@hugobarauna</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/cantoniodasilva">@cantoniodasilva</a>), e cogitei a
compra do Rework, mas depois de uma pergunta no Twitter e algumas
respostas sobre a idéia do livro eu resolvi não comprar, pois parecia
muito gerencial, e acabei optando por outros (Design Patterns In Ruby,
Ruby Programming Language, The Pragmatic Programmer), que falarei em
outros posts :P.</p>
<p>No fim das contas o <a href="http://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu">@rafaelrosafu</a>
viu minha pergunta no Twitter e me emprestou o livro! \o/ Aproveitei
que eu tinha acabado de ler o ultimo livro que eu estava lendo (Mestre
Gil de Ham do J.R.R Tolkien), e já iniciei a nova leitura.</p>
<p>O livro me surpreendeu bastante, talvez por que eu estava esperando
algo mais monótono, e ele é bem o contrário disso, dá várias dicas
interessantes (que ajudaram eles quando estavam contruindo seus
produtos, e ajudam até hoje) para quem pretende começar um novo
negócio, e ainda dá algumas análises interessantes sobre como pensar
como uma pequena empresa.</p>
<p>Alguns tópicos interessantes do livro:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reuniões são tóxicas</strong> - O tempo que você perde em uma reunião e o retorno que ela te traz</li>
<li><strong>Não contratar Rockstars</strong> - Criar um ambiente ótimo para extrair o Rockstar das pessoas</li>
<li><strong>Planejar é chutar</strong> - Não levar tão a sério o planejamento pois todo planejamento é um chute grande ou pequeno</li>
<li><strong>Tempo não é desculpa</strong> - Sabe aquele seu projeto que você está postergando há meses? Pois é&hellip;Você pode dedicar uma hora por dia para ele, e não esperar que aquele tempo sobrando venha, por que dificilmente virá. (esse bateu de frente comigo :P)</li>
<li><strong>Comece no epicentro e ignore os detalhes</strong> - Mantenha o foco no centro do que o seu produto pretende fazer e evite detalhes no começo, para ter uma idéia mais geral e deixe o foco nos detalhes para uma segunda fase.</li>
<li><strong>Durma</strong> - Não adianta trabalhar várias noites e perder toda a sua concentração e idéias por estar com uma mente cansada. Trabalhe e durma o suficiente para se manter criativo.</li>
<li><strong>Diga não por padrão</strong> - Vejo muita gente que não sabe fazer isso, e realmente, o não muitas vezes é mais importante que o sim.</li>
<li><strong>Faça pequenas decisões</strong> - É sempre mais fácil do que as grandes.</li>
<li><strong>Aprenda a contratar</strong> - Contrate quando precisar, não examine apenas currículo por que ele não diz nada, não se preocupe muito com anos de experiência por que isso não é uma boa medida e não se preocupe com a localidade dos seus funcionários.</li>
<li><strong>De liberdade aos seus funcionários</strong> - Eles não são crianças, e o seu custo de ficar monitorando eles para ver se eles estão realmente trabalhando é pior do que deixar eles por conta própria, e algum divertimento controlado no horário de trabalho não vai lhe trazer grandes prejuízos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enfim, esses são apenas alguns comentários sobre tópicos que eu achei interessante de ler no livro. É claro que eles estão falando de como é a realidade deles na 37signals, e você não vai conseguir aplicar essa idéia em qualquer empresa de qualquer área, mas para a minha realidade (e de muitos outros desenvolvedores) veio bem a calhar.</p>
<p>O livro contém muitos outros tópicos interessantes, e tem uma leitura bem agradável (é pequeno, tem uns desenhos por capítulo, demorei cerca de 5 horas para ler ele completo). Recomendo! ;)</p>

            <description>Finalmente depois de 4 anos planejando eu consegui ir para o FISL! :)
Para quem ainda não sabe, eu estou trabalhando na Locaweb desde o começo deste mês e consegui ir com a equipe deles para o FISL.
Esperava um conteúdo técnico melhor no FISL, e algumas palestras (ou a falta de boas palestras) me decepcionou um pouco, mas pelo que eu fiquei sabendo foi decisão do público os temas, então ficou meio incontrolável.</description>

<p>Para quem ainda não sabe, eu estou trabalhando na <a href="www.locaweb.com.br">Locaweb</a> desde o
começo deste mês e consegui ir com a equipe deles para o FISL.</p>
<p>Esperava um conteúdo técnico melhor no FISL, e algumas palestras (ou a
falta de boas palestras) me decepcionou um pouco, mas pelo que eu fiquei
sabendo foi decisão do público os temas, então ficou meio incontrolável.
Mas como eu sempre digo, a melhor coisa dos eventos não são apenas as
palestras, mas também as pessoas que você conhece e os papos que rolam
entre uma palestra e outra, e isso foi bem legal! :)</p>
<p>Algumas palestras que eu assisti:</p>
<h4 id="xen-ferramenta-de-administração-da-conab">Xen Ferramenta de administração da Conab</h4>
<p>Foi um case interessante do pessoal da Conab que criou uma ferramenta
para administrar as maquinas Xen que eles tem internamente. E é uma
aplicação Django Open Source. :)</p>
<h4 id="an-introduction-to-qt-the-toolkit-that-can-take-you-anywhere">An Introduction to Qt: The toolkit that can take you anywhere</h4>
<p>Quem me segue no Twitter há algum tempo deve lembrar de alguns posts que
eu fiz falando de Qt, pois eu resolvi estudar Qt e GTK Just for fun, e
no fim das contas eu gostei bastante de Qt (e quase nada de GTK :P).
Nessa palestra vi algumas coisas introdutórias de Qt e descobri uma IDE
para Qt (no estilo .NET mesmo de ficar arrastando coisas), que é a
QTCreator e uma biblioteca de teste para coisas Qt, que é a QTestLib.</p>
<h4 id="libvirt-a-biblioteca-de-virtualização">Libvirt: A biblioteca de virtualização</h4>
<p>Palestra do meu amigo <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/FISL11#5498175193882024498">Eduardo Otubo</a>, mas foi bem curtinha e eu só
peguei o finalzinho. Como diria ele: “Não tem muito o que falar de
LibVirt também”.</p>
<h4 id="crash-course-on-git">Crash course on Git</h4>
<p>Palestra com o Scott Schacon do <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>, que mostrou algumas coisas
simples de Git, mas foi interessante assistir mesmo assim. Nos outros
dias teve outras dele falando sobre branchs e como trabalhar com eles,
que foi um pouco mais interessante, mas nada além do que eu já estava
acostumado.</p>
<h4 id="deltacloud-many-cloud-one-api">DeltaCloud: Many cloud one API</h4>
<p>Outra palestra do Eduardo Otubo, que desta vez até fez uma citação para
a <a href="www.locaweb.com.br">Locaweb</a> que talvez usará algo com DeltaCloud. Essa tecnologia é bem
legal por centralizar várias APIs em um ponto único. :)</p>
<h4 id="segurança-e-desafios-em-cloud-computing">Segurança e desafios em cloud computing</h4>
<p>Achei que essa palestra fosse mais sobre “como fazer cloud computing”
mas nesse caso era mais “como usar cloud computing de maneira segura”,
portanto não aproveitei muito a palestra.</p>
<h4 id="curso-de-ruby-e-rails">Curso de Ruby e Rails</h4>
<p>Durante o FISL teve 3 aulas do Daniel Lopes sobre Ruby/Rails. A primeira
foi somente sobre Ruby puro e eu gostei bastante de ver ele passando o
básico para a galera! Sinto falta de pessoas ensinando Ruby e não
ensinando Rails…Por isso gostei bastante e acho que ele se saiu muito
bem. Nos outros 2 dias foi algo mais Rails básico, portanto assisti
pouca coisa. Mas valeu a pena para quem não conhecia, ou conhecia bem
pouco a linguagem e o framework.</p>
<h4 id="analise-de-tráfego-em-redesw-tcpip-com-tcpdump">Analise de tráfego em redesw TCP/IP com tcpdump</h4>
<p>Gostei muito dessa palestra! Foi bem conceitual sobre os pacotes e
protocolos, mas teve algumas amostragem do que estava acontecendo usando
tcpdump, e foi uma maravilhosa aula de redes em 1 hora. :)</p>
<h4 id="lapidando-ruby--estudo-de-boas-práticas">Lapidando Ruby – Estudo de boas práticas</h4>
<p>Eu já conhecia o palestrante (<a href="http://mauricioszabo.wordpress.com/">Maurício Szabo</a>) de nome pelo Guru-SP e
por outros lugares que eu já tinha visto esse nome (não me lembro bem
onde). A palestra foi bem interessante, e o assunto se direcionou sobre
umas opiniões do palestrante sobre determinadas coisas, como padrões,
refactoring, testes e outras coisas. Concordo com muita coisa que ele
disse e discordo de outras, mas esse era mesmo o intuito dele com a
palestra, levantar questões sobre as coisas que ele considera boas
práticas e ver as opiniões da galera. Gostei bastante da palestra.</p>
<h4 id="introdução-a-go">Introdução a Go</h4>
<p>Essa palestra me decepcionou bastante, assim como a linguagem em si. Não
vi vantagens pelas quais eu poderia apostar na linguagem Go. :(</p>
<h4 id="ext4--a-nova-geração-dos-filesystems">Ext4 – A nova geração dos Filesystems</h4>
<p>Está entre uma das melhores palestras do FISL na minha opinião. Foi bem
técnica e mostrou quais são as vantagens do EXT4 sobre os outros
FILESYSTEMS focando bastante no EXT3. As vantagens do EXT4 são bem
legais, entre elas o melhor tratamento sobre arquivos grandes, e algumas
soluções de problemas com datas e etc. Gostei de entender a diferença
dos dois.</p>
<h4 id="disponibilidade-gt-99999">Disponibilidade &gt;= 99.999%</h4>
<p>Uma palestra bem para Sysadmin, mostrando como eles fazem para sempre
manter a disponibilidade das aplicações dele na empresa que ele trabalha
atualmente. Gostei das práticas que eles usam de sempre fazer um
snapshot da maquina de produção para poder fazer a homologação em uma
maquina “espelho”, mas achei meio estranho o modo de gerenciar as
configurações por pacotes, sendo que usar um configuration manager faria
bem mais sentido.</p>
<h4 id="criando-soluções-inteligentes-com-shellscript">Criando soluções inteligentes com Shellscript</h4>
<p>Esperava bem mais dessa palestra e nem terminei de assistir inteira.
Esperava que o palestrante mostrasse várias técnicas de Shellscript, mas
na verdade ele estava mostrando um pequeno conjunto de scripts que
faziam configurações e resolvi um problema que ele tinha. Mas para mim
não era nada interessante a palestra.</p>
<h4 id="ovirt--ambiente-minimalista-de-virtualização-para-servidores">oVirt – Ambiente minimalista de virtualização para servidores</h4>
<p>A ultima palestra do FISL para mim. Fui mesmo para conhecer o <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/ovirt/">oVirt</a> e
saber “qual é a dele”, mas o projeto não me impressionou muito.</p>
<p>No fim de cada dia do evento eu sai com uma galera diferente para bater
papo, um dia com o próprio pessoal da <a href="www.locaweb.com.br">Locaweb</a>, outro com a galera do
<a href="http://www.slackwarebrasil.org/">GUS-BR</a>, e outras pessoas também!</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>O evento foi muito legal, conheci muita gente legal, assisti palestras
boas, cresci bastante e estou pronto para o próximo.</p>
<p>Encontrei <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/FISL11#5498179634054435602">vários Rubyistas</a> por lá (faltou apenas o Carlos Eduardo da
<a href="http://www.egenialsas.com.br/">e-Genial</a> que tambem estava por lá mas não saiu na foto), inclusive a
galera do Guru-RS que eu só conhecia por e-mail. Galera gente fina!</p>
<p>Encontrei a <a href="http://twitter.com/_leticia">Letícia Figueira</a> que eu já conheço há mais de 3 anos pela
internet (via <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class">Rubylearning.org</a>), pois ela também era uma Assist.
Teacher quando eu participava mais ativamente, e nunca tinha conversado
pessoalmente. Foi bem divertido. :)</p>
<p>E via Letícia eu acabei conhecendo a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/FISL11#5498179590379727106">galera da Fande</a>(que é <a href="http://fande.com.br/">uma
empresa</a> que atualmente trabalha com Ruby/Rails no RS), que são todos
gente fina!</p>
<p>Fora outros amigos que encontrei aleatóriamente, como o <a href="https://twitter.com/clauber_halic">Clauber Halic</a>
da <a href="http://www.mozillabrasil.org/">MozBr</a>, a <a href="http://www.griebeler.com/">Bruna Griebeler</a>, o <a href="http://www.guanabara.info">Gustavo Guanabara</a>, <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com">Fabio Akita</a> e
outros.</p>
<p>Para quem quiser ver as <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/FISL11#">fotos que eu tirei por lá é só ver no meu
picasa</a>. ;)</p>
<p>Obrigado <a href="www.locaweb.com.br">Locaweb</a> por ter me levado lá! You Rock!</p>

            <description>Como vocês puderam perceber (ou não) eu não postei sobre os serviços legais de fevereiro e tenho um bom motivo para isso: Não achei nenhum serviço que valia a pena ser mencionado e não queria fazer um post enchendo linguiça! :P
O meu ultimo post foi sobre o Yahoo Open Hack 2009, e lá eu pude conhecer muita coisa legal, e ver outras nascendo de projetos lá mesmo! Por isso tenho informações legais para essa série novamente!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Como vocês puderam perceber (ou não) eu não postei sobre os serviços
legais de fevereiro e tenho um bom motivo para isso: Não achei nenhum
serviço que valia a pena ser mencionado e não queria fazer um post
enchendo linguiça! :P</p>
<p>O meu ultimo post foi sobre o Yahoo Open Hack 2009, e lá eu pude
conhecer muita coisa legal, e ver outras nascendo de projetos lá
mesmo! Por isso tenho informações legais para essa série novamente! ;)</p>
<p>Vamos lá:</p>
<h4 id="yql">YQL</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a>, é um serviço do yahoo que
ajuda o desenvolvedor que quer trabalhar com dados de vários lugares a
não sei preocupar em aprender cada uma das API&rsquo;s.  O que o YQL faz é
dar para o desenvolvedor uma linguagem muito parecida com SQL (um
pouco mais limitada, mas lembra muito) para que o desenvolvedor possa
fazer querys das informações que ele deseja de vários serviços.
Grande parte dos serviços do Yahoo estão disponíveis utilizando YQL e
você pode fazer vários testes utilizando o próprio <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/">console do
YQL</a>.  Uma coisa legal é a
posibilidade de criar algumas tabelas baseadas em dados de outros
serviços, ou baseadas em .csv e outras coisas.</p>
<p>Enfim, vale muito a pena dar uma olhada.</p>
<h4 id="spaiame">Spaia.me</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://spaia.me/">spaia.me</a> é um serviço bem legal para gerar
widgets para seu site/blog. Ele faz buscas em serviços como o Twitter,
Flickr, Del.icio.us e meme e traz os resultados referentes a sua
palavra em um box &ldquo;animado&rdquo; por JQuery.</p>
<p>Esse gerador de widgets foi feito pelo <a href="http://nuxlli.com.br/">Nuxlli</a>
e pelo <a href="http://blog.talleye.com/">Cipriani</a> no Open Hack day! :)</p>
<h4 id="foursquare">Foursquare</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> é um serviço bem interessante
para você postar sobre sua localização e fazer reviews dos lugares que
você frequenta.  Resolvi comentar sobre ele justamente por que
comentaram comigo sobre ele no #brhackday e eu fui dar uma olhada na
API, e vi os hacks legais que dá para fazer com isso. :)</p>
<h4 id="jsfiddle">JSFiddle</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://www.jsfiddle.net/JEYMm/">JSFiddle</a> é um lugar muito legal
para testar Javascript. Ele te dá acesso a uma série de bibliotecas
javascript (tais como JQuery, Prototype, Mootools e outras) para que
você possa fazer testes e comparações de funcionalidade entre uma e
outra utilizando o mesmo HTML / CSS.  Aconselho muito o uso dela,
principalmente se você está estudando uma biblioteca específica ou
apenas quer saber se determinada biblioteca tem funcionalidades
melhores do que a sua biblioteca preferida.</p>
<p>É isso ae galera! Espero que esses serviços sejam úteis para vocês! :)</p>

            <description>Aqui estou eu mais uma vez para falar mais uma das maluquices que eu fiz um bom tempo atrás mas não tive tempo de postar.
Primeiramente eu vou falar o que muita gente já falou muito bem, que é sobre screen e pair programming. Mas vou dizer como funcionou para mim. Alguns posts que eu li antes e depois de começar a brincar com screen e pair programming, e que eu gostei:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aqui estou eu mais uma vez para falar mais uma das maluquices que eu
fiz um bom tempo atrás mas não tive tempo de postar.</p>
<p>Primeiramente eu vou falar o que muita gente já falou muito bem, que é
sobre screen e pair programming. Mas vou dizer como funcionou para mim.
Alguns posts que eu li antes e depois de começar a brincar com screen e
pair programming, e que eu gostei:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.caikesouza.com/blog/2009/05/remote-pair-programming-with-screen/">Post do Caike sobre Pair programming remoto usando screen</a></li>
<li><a href="http://qmx.me/pair%20programming">Post do Qmx sobre pair programming usando screen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Primeiramente vamos começar com umas dicas do post do caike:</p>
<p>Para mim foi necessário alterar as permissões do Screen:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod +s /usr/bin/screen
sudo chmod 775 /var/run/screen
</code></pre>
<p>Agora é só seguir a velha receita dos dois posts:</p>
<p>Primeiro usuário:</p>
<ul>
<li>O primeiro usuário acessa o computador host via ssh</li>
<li>executa o comando <strong>screen -S nomedoscreen</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Segundo usuário:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acessa o servidor com o mesmo nome de usuário/senha do primeiro</li>
<li>executa screen -x</li>
</ul>
<p>Pronto! As duas pessoas estão compartilhando a mesma tela agora e podem
usar o Vim para programar (claro, qual outro editor seria, não!?).</p>
<p>Nunca consegui utilizar o screen multiusuário (como mencionado no post
do caike) mas isso não é um grande problema. :)</p>
<h4 id="como-eu-usei">Como eu usei</h4>
<p>Primeiramente fiz um pair programming normal com o <a href="http://twitter.com/mateuslinhares">@mateuslinhares</a>,
onde nós dois ficavamos no mesmo screen conversando (estavamos há menos
de 2 metros de distância), e cada um com seu teclado, podendo intervir a
qualquer momento. Isso foi legal por que não precisávamos ficar
dividindo espaço de um mesmo monitor ou de um mesmo teclado, e ainda
driblava outros problemas que tínhamos na época.</p>
<h4 id="uma-nova-idéia">Uma nova idéia</h4>
<p>Na época desse pair programming estavamos com uma task grande e
trabalhosa, mas podia ser feita individualmente, e provavelmente seria
mais produtiva do que em pair programming, mas tinha uma particularidade
muito interessante. Cada um de nós conhecia melhor uma parte do sistema,
portanto, se mantivessemos contato contínuo isso ia acelerar o trabalho,
pois precisávamos alterar/retirar algumas coisas que podiam ou não ser
importantes para o sistema como um todo. Levando tudo isso em conta me
surgiu uma idéia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Por que não fazer tudo com um “semi pair programming”, onde cada um
trabalhava no seu computador mas visualizando a tela do outro em um
split.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanto eu como o @mateuslinhares estamos acostumados a separar o nosso
vim em vários splits verticais e horizontais, ou seja, um split vertical
do screen não seria o problema.</p>
<h4 id="o-que-fizemos">O que fizemos</h4>
<p>Decidimos então seguir o seguinte script:</p>
<p>Setup das duas maquinas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vim</li>
<li>Screen</li>
<li>Um usuário em comum</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="pothix-">PotHix :</h5>
<ul>
<li>com o usuário compartilhado executa um <strong>screen -S pothix</strong> na sua maquina</li>
<li>Abre um novo split no screen com o comando <strong>ctrl+a s</strong></li>
<li>Nesse novo split acessa a maquina do Mateus e executa <strong>screen -x</strong> para acessar o screen que o @mateuslinhares criou na maquina dele</li>
<li>Volta para o split anterior e trabalha normalmente</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="mateuslinhares">@mateuslinhares</h5>
<ul>
<li>com o usuário compartilhado executa um <strong>screen -S mateuslinhares</strong> na sua maquina</li>
<li>Abre um novo split no screen com o comando <strong>ctrl+a s</strong></li>
<li>Nesse novo split acessa a maquina do Mateus e executa <strong>screen -x</strong> para acessar o screen que o PotHix criou na maquina dele</li>
<li>Volta para o split anterior e trabalha normalmente</li>
</ul>
<p>Seguindo esse script teremos os 2 utilizando um screen com um split,
sendo que um split é para seu trabalho local e no outro você pode
acompanhar e dar pitacos no trabalho do seu comparsa! :)</p>
<h4 id="benefícios">Benefícios</h4>
<p>No caso dessa nossa task isso resolveu muito o nosso problema, por que
conseguimos trabalhar em locais distintos mas sempre em constante
comunicação, o que sempre trazia alguns comentários como:</p>
<p><strong>PotHix</strong>: Ow… Não tira isso aí não por que vai quebrar tal parada.</p>
<p>ou então:</p>
<p><strong>Mateuslinhares</strong>: Cara… Olha isso aqui no screen, dá para fazer na sua
parte tambem.</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>Para mim foi muito bom e recomendo a todos para tentarem algo do tipo
quando tiverem chance (a não ser que você use Textmate…nesse caso…boa
sorte! :P)! A unica coisa que eu recomendo é utilizar 2 monitores, assim
você pode deixar a tela do seu comparsa no outro monitor (divida os
monitores verticalmente) e trabalhar com vários splits no seu monitor. :)</p>
<p>É totalmente possível trabalhar com 1 monitor apenas (foi assim
que trabalhamos) mas você obviamente perde um pouco de espaço.</p>
<p>Espero que essas informações sejam úteis para mais alguém.</p>
<p>Qualquer dúvida ou sugestão deixe nos comentários. :)</p>

            <title>Palestra sobre Vim</title>

            <description>Esse vai ser um post curto, apenas para deixar registrado algumas informações sobre a palestra de Vim que teve no sétimo encontro do Guru-sp (sim, eu fui o palestrante :D).
Primeiramente, já começo com uma desculpa, por que já faz mais de 2 semanas que palestrei e só agora estou fazendo esse post. :(
Foi bem legal palestrar para uma galera que já conhecia ao menos um pouco do editor. Quando eu estava planejando o que eu ia falar eu fiquei com uma grande dúvida de qual seria a minha linha de apresentação, por que eu não sabia quantos já conheciam o editor, portanto eu poderia chegar falando de coisas avançadas e ninguem entenderia nada, ou pelo contrário, se muitos conhecessem e eu chegasse falando de coisas básicas demais a palestra seria um saco.</description>

minha solução para isso foi preparar os slides de uma forma que eu
conseguisse falar mais ou menos de determinados assuntos baseado no
conhecimento do pessoal. Os slides que saíram foram esses:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Quando perguntei para o pessoal quem já utilizava, quem nunca abriu
(ou não conseguiu sair&hellip;heheh) e que usa como editor principal, eu
descobri que estava equilibrado. Portanto segui uma linha mais comum.</p>
<p>Tive a sorte do <a href="http://www.agaelebe.com.br">agaelebe</a> gravar (valeu

            <description>Para quem ainda não soube, no final de semana passado rolou o Yahoo Open Hack Day 2010! O intuito do evento é juntar uma grande quantidade de Hackers para criar serviços úteis utilizando informações públicas e de preferência utilizar as API&amp;rsquo;s do Yahoo (havia premios para alguns hacks com elas).
Uma das coisas legais do evento é que nada é proibido com relação aos Hacks, ou seja, você pode fazer um Hack com as ferramentas do Google (não vai concorrer aos premios, mas poderá apresentar lá e tudo mais), todas as linguagens de programação estão permitidas, não somente hacks web eram permitidos, o que deixou a criatividade ir longe.</description>

Open Hack Day 2010! O intuito do evento é juntar uma grande quantidade
de Hackers para criar serviços úteis utilizando informações públicas e
de preferência utilizar as API&rsquo;s do Yahoo (havia premios para alguns
hacks com elas).</p>
<p>Uma das coisas legais do evento é que nada é proibido com relação aos
Hacks, ou seja, você pode fazer um Hack com as ferramentas do Google
(não vai concorrer aos premios, mas poderá apresentar lá e tudo mais),
todas as linguagens de programação estão permitidas, não somente hacks
web eram permitidos, o que deixou a criatividade ir longe. :D</p>
<h4 id="equipe-e-idéia">Equipe e idéia</h4>
<p>Participei do evento juntamente com uma equipe que formamos no
<a href="www.ikwa.com.br">Ikwa</a>, e chamamos a equipe de SleepyProgrammers.</p>
<p>Nossa idéia era fazer um site para marcar rolês fotográficos, e
utilizaríamos para isso as API&rsquo;s do Flickr, Meme, Weather e Maps.</p>
<p>Ao chegar no evento e ver a palestra sobre YQL nós já percebemos que
não seria necessário aprender a usar essas várias API&rsquo;s e apenas
precisávamos aprender a usar o YQL e saber quais informações
poderíamos retornar de qual serviço. :)</p>
<h4 id="metodologia-e-projeto">Metodologia e projeto</h4>
<p><a href="/images/posts/openhack.jpg" title="Equipe do openhack"><img src="/images/posts/openhack.jpg" alt="Foto da equipe do Openhack" title="Equipe do Openhack"></a></p>
<p>Como já estamos acostumados a utilizar Scrum no
<a href="www.ikwa.com.br">Ikwa</a> nós resolvemos fazer o mesmo para o nosso
projetinho. Começamos com uma planning meeting logo na primeira hora
para poder dar uma estimada no que pretendíamos fazer, e logo depois
dividir as tarefas entre os membros da equipe.  Mais ou menos de 2 em
2 horas (ou um pouco mais) fazíamos umas stand-up meetings para manter
todos atualizados. A noite percebemos que isso não estava sendo muito
necessário por que estávamos em constante comunicação, mas mesmo assim
resolvemos seguir o costume, afinal demorava apenas uns 4 minutos. :)</p>
<p>O projeto seguia bem, com layout legal e algumas buscas supostamente
funcionando até mais ou menos as 9 da noite.</p>
<h4 id="os-problemas">Os problemas</h4>
<ul>
<li>Já percebemos que a nossa busca não estava retornando exatamente o que gostaríamos de receber, mas deixamos para dar uma refinada nisso no final do tempo, para não ficar muito tempo presos nisso.</li>
<li>Tivemos um programador a menos (<a href="http://twitter.com/_bojak">@_bojak</a>) que infelizmente estava usando Windows (acreditem se quiser) por que o netbook que ele comprou (exatamente para evitar ter que usar windows no notebook velho que ele tinha) não chegou a tempo do evento. Muitas das coisas que são simples de se instalar/fazer em um &ldquo;Unix like&rdquo; são uma grande dor de cabeça para se fazer no Windows, portanto o @_bojak teve tantos problemas que chegou uma hora que desistiu de colocar a mão em código.</li>
<li>Algum descuidado da equipe criou a pasta &ldquo;Views&rdquo; no famigerado Textmate (escrevi uma gracinha aqui e apaguei para não gerar flame de textmate), e assim bugou a aplicação na minha maquina Linux, e me deixou um tempinho procurando qual era o problema. #fail</li>
<li>O Heroku não colaborou para funcionar utilizando o bundler, e depois de muito tempo tentando nós abandonamos o bundler e utilizamos oldstyle mesmo.</li>
<li>O nosso outro programador (<a href="http://twitter.com/jorge_silveira">@jorge_silveira</a>) saiu (já tinha avisado que sairia) dizendo que voltaria e simplesmente deixou a equipe na mão (tem seus argumentos, mas essa é minha opinião&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="o-fail-do-projeto">O fail do projeto</h4>
<p>Depois desse monte de problemas eu já estava desmotivado com o projeto
e comecei a ficar com bastante sono, portanto tirei umas 3 horas para
dormir (fora o tempo que dormi na mesa), enquanto só o
<a href="http://twitter.com/_bojak">@_bojak</a> ficou trabalhando motivadão
(usando o computador do <a href="http://twitter.com/rafaeltimbo">@rafaeltimbo</a>
que tambem estava dormindo :P).</p>
<p>Logo pela manhã sabendo que um programador tinha arregado
(<a href="http://twitter.com/jorge_silveira">@jorge_silveira</a>), um estava
impossibilitado de trabalhar com seu próprio computador
(<a href="http://twitter.com/_bojak">@_bojak</a>) e nossa busca não estava
retornando coisas legais para continuar, nós decidimos que esse
projeto ficaria para depois do Open Hack Day.</p>
<p>No fim das contas fizemos uma retrospectiva bem legal, onde vimos
grande parte dos problemas que tivemos e boa parte das soluções
tambem, foi bem legal! :)</p>
<h4 id="o-evento">O evento</h4>
<p>Ok, nosso projeto não vingou mesmo, mas o evento valeu muito para mim!
Aprendi coisas novas, revi amigos, conheci pessoas novas, conheci as
API&rsquo;s do Yahoo, comi e bebi de graça, descobri que não devo acreditar
nas palavras de alguns, descobri que algumas pessoas com certeza
estarão na minha equipe novamente se quiserem&hellip;. E mais várias outras
coisas!</p>
<p>No fim das contas eu tenho uma coisa para recomendar para quem não
foi&hellip; Quando tiver o próximo, não perca a oportunidade! O evento vale
muito a pena! :)</p>
<p>Para quem quiser ver as fotos que eu tirei no evento pode dar uma
olhada no meu <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/Openhack?feat=directlink">album do
Picasa</a>.</p>

            <description>Esse começo de ano eu estou aproveitando para participar de alguns eventos, e a Campus Party é um dos principais deles. Assim que eu entrei na empresa que eu estou trabalhando atualmente eu já informei que em janeiro tinha um evento que eu gostaria muito de participar (entrei na empresa em abril :P) e deixei combinado que eu estaria liberado para o tal, portanto agora consegui uma semana de férias para aproveitar a campus party!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Esse começo de ano eu estou aproveitando para participar de alguns
eventos, e a Campus Party é um dos principais deles.  Assim que eu
entrei na empresa que eu estou trabalhando atualmente eu já informei
que em janeiro tinha um evento que eu gostaria muito de participar
(entrei na empresa em abril :P) e deixei combinado que eu estaria
liberado para o tal, portanto agora consegui uma semana de férias para
aproveitar a campus party! :)</p>
<h4 id="entrada">Entrada</h4>
<p>Começando pela entrada no evento na segunda feira. Entrar em um evento
onde se está esperando 6000 pessoas que vão receber barracas para
acampar e tem que ter seus notebooks cadastrados e etiquetados nunca é
fácil, e não foi dessa vez que as coisas foram mais rápidas.  Na
segunda feira tínhamos uma fila monumental para cada coisa que tinha
que fazer, desde a entrada, passando pelo cadastramento e pelo local
onde retiramos as mochilas e barracas.  Mas não estava mal organizado
a princípio, o problema era a quantidade de gente mesmo. :)</p>
<h4 id="camping">Camping</h4>
<p>A área de camping estava organizada como sempre, mas dessa vez todas
as barracas estavam montadas (da ultima vez nós tivemos que montar as
nossas) e eles estavam apenas distribuindo os numeros delas.  Levei um
coxão inflável dessa vez por que o coxão do ano passado era quase um
lençol&hellip;hehehe&hellip;Era como se eu estivesse dormindo no chão.  Para
dormir por lá é sempre barulhento pois a Campus Party não para um
segundo, sempre tem pessoas gritando sem motivo independente da hora,
mas isso não atrapalha (muito) a diversão.</p>
<h4 id="palestras">Palestras</h4>
<p>Achei que fosse assistir bem mais palestras esse ano, mas quando
estava por lá eu fiquei com preguiça de assistir algumas. :P Uma das
coisas que foi mais legal na Campus Party esse ano na minha opinião
foi a transmissão ao vivo das palestras! Eu mesmo assisti mais de uma
palestra pela internet, tanto quando eu estava em casa como quando eu
estava no evento, por que eu achava o audio bem melhor do que ter que
ouvir no meio de todo o ruído que os campuseiros produzem.</p>
<p>Gostaria de destacar algumas palestras que eu assisti e gostei muito:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matemática para não matemáticos</li>
<li>Matemática orientada a Computação gráfica</li>
<li>Criando e lançando um site em 42 minutos com Sinatra</li>
<li>Segurança e RubyOnRails</li>
<li>Introdução ao Blender</li>
<li>Desenvolvimento de games para IPhone</li>
</ul>
<p>Cada uma teve suas particularidades, mas foram bem legais de se
assistir e cada uma agregou um pouco a meu conhecimento.</p>
<h4 id="internet">Internet</h4>
<p>A internet do Evento não deixou a desejar, e como muitos sabem, o
forte de compartilhamento da Campus Party não é a internet, e sim os
programas de P2P que usamos internamente (no caso o dc++).</p>
<p>Alguns pontos de rede não estavam funcionando, mas esse não foi um
grande empecilho, sendo que a grande maioria estava e você podia
simplesmente sentar, plugar o seu notebook e compartilhar arquivos a
mais de 1MB por segundo (consegui 9MB no começo do evento).  A
internet para download externo também não deixou na mão,
possibilitando downloads a 1MB por segundo dependendo do servidor que
está fornecendo o download,</p>
<h4 id="inovação">Inovação</h4>
<p>Um foco bem legal da Campus Party é trazer inovação, mostrar projetos
inovadores, incentivar jovens a inovarem criando novas tecnologias e
novos negócios.  Na área expo tinha muitas coisas interessantes, como
por exemplo, um jogo que utiliza o controle do Wii e simula um spray
que deixa você &ldquo;pixar&rdquo; uma tela virtual e fazer vários tipos de
desenhos.</p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Essa é a parte que mais me motiva a ir para a Campus Party! Muito mais
do que arquivos, internet, palestras ou outras coisas, eu vou para a
Campus Party para ver os amigos e bater um papo sobre coisas
interessantes/ Até amigos de outros estados vem para a Campus Party e
eu tenho a chance de vê-los, né <a href="http://griebeler.com/">Griebeler</a>! :)</p>
<p>E tudo isso sem contar os amigos novos que eu faço por lá e o pessoal
que eu só conhecia pela internet e conheci pessoalmente! Entre eles
estão Ricardo, Pedro, Lucas, Rencka, João, oTubo e mais uma galera! :)</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>Eu recomendo participar da Campus Party pelo menos algum dia se você
tiver a chance. :)</p>
<p>Você já deve ter ouvido falar que a Campus Party é mó zona, fica um
monte de gente gritando sem motivo, pessoas fazendo brincadeiras que
não tem graça nenhuma, as palestras são difíceis de ouvir tanto pela
zona como por que há várias palestras simultâneas e os palcos são
próximos e etc&hellip;  Eu só tenho uma coisa a te dizer: <strong>Isso é tudo
verdade, mas eu iria mesmo assim!</strong></p>
<p>Nada disso atrapalha a sua diversão, e o seu benefício, você apenas
precisa &ldquo;entrar na brincadeira&rdquo; e aproveitar. ;)</p>

            <description>E vou para um assunto meio OFF no meu blog (ou não), que é falar de shows que vou, nesse caso o do Metallica!
Há muito tempo queria que o Metallica viesse para o Brasil, e no ano passado que tiveram vários shows bons (ACDC, Motorhead, Megadeth, Iron Maiden e etc) fiquei sabendo que eles viriam ao Brasil e já antecipei a compra do ingresso com a ajuda do meu amigo Bruno Assis que é cliente do CityBank.</description>

a compra do ingresso com a ajuda do meu amigo <a href="http://blog.brunoassis.org/">Bruno
Assis</a> que é cliente do CityBank.</p>
<p>Em semana de Campus Party já me preparei para ir para o show, mas o
cabeção aqui esqueceu a carteirinha de estudante em casa na carteira
(levo só o essencial para o show, mas esqueci a carteririnha :P) em
casa, portanto tive que apelar para o meu pai me encontrar em algum
lugar com a minha carteira, o que gerou grandes problemas entre me
perder pelos lados do morumbi de moto e outras coisas.  Relevando
todos esses imprevistos, consegui chegar novamente ao estádio e
entrar. Combinei com um amigo da faculdade que encontraria ele lá
dentro, mas chegando na pista e vendo aquela multidão de pessoas já
tinha me conformado qeu ele nunca ia me encontrar por lá. Por incrível
que pareça, quando o show do Sepultura estava começando lá estava o
meu colega me encontrando.</p>
<h4 id="show-do-sepultura">Show do Sepultura</h4>
<p>Uma coisa muito legal desse show é que o Sepultura ia abrir o show, ou
seja, alem de ver Metallica ainda ia ver Sepultura antes e ter a
chance de participar de umas rodas pesadas por lá! :P Infelizmente
conheço pouco de Sepultura, até gosto das musicas, mas não conheço as
letras das musicas e tal, portanto ainda fiquei viajando um pouco ate
tocar Territory! :D</p>
<p>O Show foi muito legal, apesar do som estar meio baixo e tal.</p>
<h4 id="show-do-metallica">Show do Metallica</h4>
<p>Depois do show do Sepultura teve um tempo de uns 40 minutos e o
Metallica finalmente abriu o show com Creeping Death! Que realmente é
coisa linda de se ouvir ao vivo! :D</p>
<p>O show teve um monte de musicas que eu sempre quis ouvir ao vivo e
felizmente eu estava lá, gritando, pulando, me batendo&hellip;Enfim, me
divertindo em momentos memoráveis. :) As musicas que do set list
foram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creeping Death</li>
<li>For Whom The Bell Tolls</li>
<li>The Four Horsemen</li>
<li>Harvester Of Sorrow</li>
<li>Fade To Black</li>
<li>That Was Just Your Life</li>
<li>The End Of The Line</li>
<li>The Day That Never Comes</li>
<li>Sad But True</li>
<li>Broken, Beat and Scarred</li>
<li>One</li>
<li>Master Of Puppets</li>
<li>Blackened</li>
<li>Nothing Else Matters</li>
<li>Enter Sandman</li>
<li>Stone Cold Crazy</li>
<li>Motorbreath</li>
<li>Seek and Destroy</li>
</ul>
<p>Como você pode ver, só musicão! Valeu meu ingresso, apesar de eu ter
olhado o set list do segundo show e ter achado melhor que o primeiro
ainda! :D</p>
<p>Se quiser ver as poucas fotos que eu tirei (4 ou 5 sem graça nenhuma,
só pela muvuca mesmo) veja <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090130Metallica?feat=directlink">no meu
picasa</a>.</p>
<h4 id="organização-e-saída">Organização e Saída</h4>
<p>Ao contrário do show do Iron esse show foi muito bem organizado (shows
em estádios são sempre melhores) e consegui entrar e sair do estádio
facilmente. Não tenho nada a reclamar do evento.</p>
<p>A minha experiência em shows no Morumbi (ACDC e Metallica) dizem que
se tiver show por lá você pode ir tranquilo sabendo que provavelmente
vai encontrar uma boa organização e maneiras fáceis de entrar e sair.</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>É claro que para ir em um show desse tamanho você precisa ignorar por
algumas horas todos os sentidos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visão</strong> - Vai ser destruída pelas luzes do estádio</li>
<li><strong>Audição</strong> - Só vai voltar ao normal no outro dia :P</li>
<li><strong>Olfato</strong> - Cerveja, maconha, suor, cigarro&hellip;Você precisa ignorar tudo isso que está ao seu redor (fazer o que&hellip;)</li>
<li><strong>Tato</strong> - Muita gente sem camisa suado passando do seu lado, e fora o calor</li>
<li><strong>Paladar</strong> - A sede mata qualquer um, e eu morro de sede mas não compro um copinho de água por 5 reais.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mas no fim das contas eu só tenho uma coisa a dizer:
Se tiver a chance de ir&hellip;Vá! :D</p>

            <description>E ae galera! Vamos para mais um post sobre os serviços legais do mes.
OpenDNS Estranho eu falar de OpenDNS não? Já existe faz tanto tempo e muita gente já conhece/usa. O que me fez colocar ele na lista de serviços legais foi justamente as opções que você tem na web do OpenDNS!
Se você se cadastrar no OpenDNS você pode configurar muitas coisas legais, como por exemplo a página de endereço não encontrado, ou a página de tentativa de fishing, entre outras.</description>

<h4 id="opendns">OpenDNS</h4>
<p>Estranho eu falar de <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> não? Já existe
faz tanto tempo e muita gente já conhece/usa.  O que me fez colocar
ele na lista de serviços legais foi justamente as opções que você tem
na web do OpenDNS!</p>
<p>Se você se cadastrar no OpenDNS você pode configurar muitas coisas
legais, como por exemplo a página de endereço não encontrado, ou a
página de tentativa de fishing, entre outras. Além de configurar
essas páginas você pode tambem definir atalhos, para quando você
tentar acessar algo como: &ldquo;http://pothix&rdquo; ele já redirecionar para
&ldquo;<a href="http://pothix.com/blog%22">http://pothix.com/blog&quot;</a> por exemplo. :)</p>
<h4 id="heroku">Heroku</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> é bem conhecido pela comunidade Ruby,
pois é uma das maneiras mais fáceis de se fazer deploy de uma
aplicação simples, bastando poucos comandos para que sua aplicação já
fique disponível na web como um subdomínio do Heroku!</p>
<p>Só para dar uma idéia da simplicidade, o que você precisa fazer para
mandar sua aplicação para o heroku (estou assumindo que vc usa Git):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo gem install heroku</code></li>
<li><code>heroku keys:add path/para/sua/key</code></li>
<li><code>heroku create nome_do_proj</code></li>
<li><code>git push heroku master</code></li>
</ul>
<p>E pronto! Sua aplicação já estará disponível em <a href="http://nome_do_proj.heroku.com">http://nome_do_proj.heroku.com</a></p>
<h4 id="caliper">Caliper</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://getcaliper.com/caliper">Caliper</a> é um serviço web bem
interessante para se obter métricas do seu código.</p>
<p>Uma das coisas que eu mais gostei no Caliper é que ele não exige
cadastro para uso, você pode apenas colocar a URL do seu projeto Git e
ele já gera os relatórios utilizando a gem <strong>metric_fu</strong> e mantém um
link para acesso dos mesmos.</p>
<p>Como de costume os meus posts sobre os serviços legais do mes são
curtos, portanto, eu fico por aqui! Espero que sejam úteis! ;)</p>

            <title>BookReview: A cabeça de Steve Jobs</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/stevejobs/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://pothix.com/posts/stevejobs/</guid>
            <description>Aqui estou eu novamente para falar de um livro que eu li nas férias! Dessa vez vou comentar sobre: &amp;ldquo;A cabeça de Steve Jobs&amp;rdquo;
Sobre o livro O livro é bem interessante e conta como Steve Jobs fez para ter o sucesso que tem atualmente, contando não somente os acertos, mas também os erros de Steve com o mercado, o que faz com que você caia na real que ele (assim como você) é apenas uma pessoa comum e que as vezes suas decisões fantásticas levavam a uma má situação.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aqui estou eu novamente para falar de um livro que eu li nas férias!
Dessa vez vou comentar sobre: <strong>&ldquo;A cabeça de Steve Jobs&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h4 id="sobre-o-livro">Sobre o livro</h4>
<p>O livro é bem interessante e conta como Steve Jobs fez para ter o
sucesso que tem atualmente, contando não somente os acertos, mas
também os erros de Steve com o mercado, o que faz com que você caia na
real que ele (assim como você) é apenas uma pessoa comum e que as
vezes suas decisões fantásticas levavam a uma má situação.</p>
<h4 id="steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</h4>
<p>Como todos que me conhecem sabem, eu estou longe de ser um Apple fan,
mas mesmo assim tive vontade de ler esse livro para ver se realmente
Steve Jobs é tudo o que dizem.</p>
<p>A experiência do livro mostra um Steve bem rude com seus funcionários,
mas que fazia as coisas andarem corretamente dentro da empresa. Pelo
visto ele tinha as boas partes de vários lados, pois ele tinha aquela
grande vontade de mudar o mundo e além disso era teimoso e estava
disposto a apostar pesado em seus produtos independentemente do quanto
ele ia ter que arriscar para isso.</p>
<p>Achei muito interessante o modo como ele revolucionou a Apple focando
em poucos produtos, mas produtos de qualidades dos quais eles
dominavam por completo.  Outra coisa que eu achei legal da
personalidade dele é o perfeccionismo, o que ajuda a criar ótimos
produtos, coisas que foram pensadas minunciosamente para estar da
melhor forma possível, e isso não está presente em todos os lugares,
atualmente o que vemos pelo mercado são vários produtos que foram
pensados para funcionarem bem, e não para atenderem todas as
necessidades ou durarem muito.</p>
<p>Elitismo! Isso é uma coisa que eu acho bem importante por sinal, Steve
sempre estava buscando pelos melhores, pessoas que ele sabia que
fariam o que seria de melhor para o que ele estava desenvolvendo, e
não se importava com a quantidade de dinheiro que precisaria para ter
essa pessoa (ou até mesmo esse objeto, ele também fazia isso com
locais e objetos, sempre o melhor!) em seus projetos.</p>
<h4 id="prós-do-livro">Prós do livro</h4>
<p>Achei bem legal as fontes de todas as frases que estão no livro, o que
comprova cada uma das entrevistas que o autor fez com as pessoas que
estavam próximas de Steve Jobs nesse meio tempo.</p>
<p>Falar sobre o sucesso de Steve Jobs em suas duas outras empresas
(Pixar e NeXT) e o quanto elas influenciaram na vida da própria Apple.</p>
<h4 id="contras-do-livro">Contras do livro</h4>
<p>Você fica totalmente perdido no tempo quando está lendo. O livro não
foca em uma ordem cronológica, portanto hora você está vendo uma
citação de 1997 e logo depois uma de 2002, e no próximo capítulo uma
de 2000.</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>Se você gosta de criar coisas, ou pensa em abrir uma empresa, leia
esse livro e entenda uma forma muito interessante de ver como fazer
produtos, erguer uma empresa ou conquistar pessoas.  Esse livro com
certeza já mudou um pouco a minha forma de pensar. ;)</p>

            <guid>https://pothix.com/posts/anjosedemonios/</guid>
            <description>Felizmente eu estou de férias da faculdade novamente, e isso me dá um tempo livre para ler alguns livros, portanto resolvi começar com “Anjos e Demônios“, que é um livro que eu estou postergando a leitura faz mais de 2 anos (desde que li o código da vinci).
Eu particularmente gosto dos livros do Dan Brown, pois em sua grande maioria são histórias “polemicas” por misturar alguns fatos reais (que ninguem consegue provar a favor nem contra) com outros que são pura ficção.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Felizmente eu estou de férias da faculdade novamente, e isso me dá um
tempo livre para ler alguns livros, portanto resolvi começar com
“<strong>Anjos e Demônios</strong>“, que é um livro que eu estou postergando a
leitura faz mais de 2 anos (desde que li o código da vinci).</p>
<p>Eu particularmente gosto dos livros do <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown">Dan Brown</a>, pois em sua grande
maioria são histórias “polemicas” por misturar alguns fatos reais (que
ninguem consegue provar a favor nem contra) com outros que são pura
ficção. Antes de ler o “<strong>Anjos e Demônios</strong>” eu já li “<strong>O código da
Vinci</strong>” e “<strong>Fortaleza Digital</strong>“, portanto já estou acostumado com o
estilo de escrita do <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown">Dan Brown</a> que sempre me estimula a leitura.</p>
<p>Pretendo (como em todo BookReview meu) novamente não dar spoilers do
livro, por que senão perde toda a graça se você for ler, portanto vou
dar apenas a minha opinião geral sobre o assunto.</p>
<p>Enfim, vamos as minhas opiniões: :)</p>
<h4 id="livro">Livro</h4>
<p>Achei o livro muito legal, segue a mesma ideia dos outros livros do <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown">Dan
Brown</a> que eu li, ou seja, sempre com um fato marcante (morte de alguem)
no começo para dar origens a vários fatos que precisam ser investigados.</p>
<p>Uma das coisas que eu achei interessante no livro é que toda a história
acontece em apenas 1 dia (diferentemente do Senhor dos anéis onde se
passam dezenas de anos…hehehe ), e gerou um livro bem extenso com uma
grande riqueza de detalhes.</p>
<p>O desfecho da história desse livro (como todos os outros livros do <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown">Dan
Brown</a>) é muito legal e tem sempre as grandes reviravoltas e revelações
que deixam você boquiaberto e com vontade de ler mais rapidamente cada
parágrafo. Mas para saber quais são você vai precisar ler. :)</p>
<h4 id="filme">Filme</h4>
<p>Se você leu o Livro e gostou eu aconselho fortemente que você nem veja o
filme. Eu estava totalmente curioso para ver o filme e logo quando
terminei de ler o livro corri direto para assistir, e me deparei com um
grande <strong>#fail</strong>.<br>
Alguns dos motivos que me fazem ter essa ideia do filme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Várias partes da história foram modificadas</li>
<li>Os nomes de alguns dos personagens mudaram</li>
<li>Personagens legais não apareceram</li>
<li>Personagens que eu nunca vi mais gordo apareceram</li>
</ul>
<p>Eu até entendo o livro fugir um pouco da história, até por que, para
que a adaptação seja boa a história precisa de algumas mudanças, é
completamente normal, mas alterar o nome dos personagens? Isso para
mim já é demais Final alternativo para fazer com que o personagem
principal tenha mais prestígio para mim também foi totalmente
desnecessário.</p>
<h4 id="considerações-finais">Considerações finais</h4>
<p>O livro é muito interessante e eu recomendo a leitura tanto para quem
já conhece as histórias do <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown">Dan Brown</a> como para quem nunca leu nenhum
livro e tem curiosidade. E apenas para lembrar… <strong>NÃO</strong> veja o filme
se você já leu o livro. 😉</p>

            <title>Crontab dentro da sua aplicação rails com whenever</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/crontab-rails/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://pothix.com/posts/crontab-rails/</guid>
            <description>Hoje estou aqui para falar de uma coisa que quando vi pela primeira vez ignorei por parecer uma coisa boba, mas olhando melhor eu percebi que é uma idéia bem interessante. O que a gem whenever faz é manter o seu crontab de uma forma mais Ruby, e melhor, dentro da sua aplicação!
A principio parece estranho tentar manter o crontab dentro da sua aplicação, mas ganhamos muitas vantagens com isso:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hoje estou aqui para falar de uma coisa que quando vi pela primeira vez
ignorei por parecer uma coisa boba, mas olhando melhor eu percebi que é
uma idéia bem interessante. O que a gem whenever faz é manter o seu
crontab de uma forma mais Ruby, e melhor, dentro da sua aplicação!</p>
<p>A principio parece estranho tentar manter o crontab dentro da sua
aplicação, mas ganhamos muitas vantagens com isso:</p>
<ul>
<li>versionamento</li>
<li>menos acesso ao servidor</li>
<li>rapida atualização do crontab do servidor via capistrano</li>
<li>forma mais legível de ver o crontab</li>
</ul>
<p>E tudo isso não influi no crontab que você já possui ( e que muitas
vezes tem muita coisa que não é relacionada com a aplicação ), pois o
whenever cria uma seção que ele atualiza mantendo a seção antiga onde
está.</p>
<p>Para instalar o whenever é a mesma facilidade de sempre:</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem install whenever
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OBS</strong>: Lembrando que a primeira linha só é necessária uma vez, se
você já tem o gemcutter no seu sources então ignore-a.</p>
<p>Depois disso execute:</p>
<pre><code>wheneverize .
</code></pre>
<p>O comando acima vai gerar os arquivos necessários para a utilização do
whenever ( básicamente o config/schedule.rb ).</p>
<p>E a partir de agora você já pode atualizar o seu crontab com as suas
configurações feitas no config/schedule.rb executando o comando:</p>
<pre><code>whenever --update-crontab suaaplicacao
</code></pre>
<p>Quando você passa como parametro a sua aplicação ele cria um bloco
apenas para as configurações da sua aplicação no crontab.</p>
<p>Mas é claro que você não vai precisar acessar o servidor e executar
esse comando toda vez que você alterar o arquivo de schedule, para
isso você provavelmente deve estar usando o capistrano para ser mais
DRY. Se estiver usando inclua algumas linhas no seu deploy.rb:</p>
<pre><code>after &quot;deploy:symlink&quot;, &quot;deploy:update_crontab&quot;

namespace :deploy do
   desc &quot;Update the crontab file&quot;
   task :update_crontab, :roles =&gt; :db do
      run &quot;cd #{release_path} &amp;&amp; whenever --update-crontab #{application}&quot;
   end
end
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OBS</strong>: Se você tiver problemas no deploy com essa linha ( como se o
comando whenever não existisse ), tente adicionar o path absoluto
para o whenever.</p>
<p>E com isso a cada vez que você fizer um cap server deploy seu crontab
será atualizado com as configurações contidas no config/schedule.rb.</p>
<p>Veja alguns exemplos do que pode ter no seu schedule.rb:</p>
<pre><code>every 4.minutes do
  rake &quot;ts:in&quot;
end

every 1.day, :at =&gt; '5:25 am' do
  rake &quot;bla_bla&quot;
end

every [:monday, :thursday], :at =&gt; '11:59 am' do
  command &quot;sudo rm -rf /&quot; # claro!
end
</code></pre>
<p>Nada do que eu demonstrei aqui é uma grande novidade, você pode ver mais
exemplos de como usar no <a href="http://www.railscasts.com">Railscasts</a> e na <a href="http://github.com/javan/whenever">própria página do plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Espero que seja útil para mais alguem como está sendo para mim.</p>

            <description>Nesse sábado, dia 28/11/2009 aconteceu aqui em São Paulo (obviamente! :P ) o Dev In Sampa! Um evento para desenvolvedores em geral, sem foco em uma determinada linguagem de programação, ou seja, um evento bem legal e pragmatico! :D
Perdi um pouco a hora, portanto não assisti o começo da palestra do José Valim, que por sinal é um assunto que muito me interessa, portanto recorri aos vídeos do @agaelebe para assistir o comecinho.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/images/posts/dev_in_sampa.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/dev_in_sampa.jpg" alt="Imagem com o logo do DevInSampa" title="Logo do DevInSampa"></a></p>
<p>Nesse sábado, dia 28/11/2009 aconteceu aqui em São Paulo (obviamente!
:P ) o Dev In Sampa! Um evento para desenvolvedores em geral, sem foco
em uma determinada linguagem de programação, ou seja, um evento bem
legal e pragmatico! :D</p>
<p>Perdi um pouco a hora, portanto não assisti o começo da palestra do
José Valim, que por sinal é um assunto que muito me interessa,
portanto recorri aos vídeos do
<a href="http://twitter.com/agaelebe" title="Hugo Borges">@agaelebe</a> para assistir o
comecinho. Para quem quiser ver os vídeos confira no
<a href="http://agaelebe.blip.tv/" title="Blip Tv do agaelebe">blip.tv do agaelebe</a>.</p>
<p>Agora vamos para  a programação e meus comentários:</p>
<h4 id="josé-valim---tópicos-de-machine-learning-classificação-de-textos">José Valim - Tópicos de machine learning: classificação de textos</h4>
<p>Como disse no começo do post, eu <!-- raw HTML omitted -->perd<!-- raw HTML omitted -->i o começo da
palestra do Jose Valim por que eu me atrasei
(<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/music/show-do-acdc" title="Show do ACDC">foi por um bom motivo</a>), mas compensei depois assistindo o vídeo.  A palestra
foi muito boa, e abordou um dos tipos de tema que eu gosto, machine
learning é bem interessante! Essa é uma das coisas que eu pretendo
estudar só por diversão, por que parece ser bem legal.  O
<a href="http://twitter.com/josevalim" title="José Valim">@josevalim</a> fez sua tese
sobre classificação de textos, portanto conhece bem do assunto e foi
muito interessante ver as pesquisas dele consolidadas e simplificadas
em uma apresentação. :)</p>
<h4 id="rodrigo-yoshima---design-de-software-as-técnicas-esquecidas">Rodrigo Yoshima - Design de Software: As técnicas esquecidas&hellip;</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://twitter.com/rodrigoy" title="Rodrigo Yoshima">@rodrigoy</a> fez uma palestra bem legal comentando sobre várias técnicas esquecidas sobre design de software, e muitos programadores que assistiram essa palestra devem ter se visto em várias situações por ele citadas ( eu fui um deles em alguns pontos ). Algumas das coisas citadas foram:</p>
<h5 id="design-incremental">Design incremental</h5>
<p>Nunca pense naquela história de &ldquo;Preciso do pedido para poder fazer a
tela de cadastro&rdquo; sempre comece por aquilo que agrega mais valor.
Faça as coisas sempre usando um pensamento incremental, criando testes
para que quando você resolva um bug não crie mais outros por não saber
as consequências de suas modificações.  Sempre tomar cuidado com o
design incremental para que ele não se torne um problema pelo mal
crescimento da sua aplicação.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomar cuidado com arquiteturas monolíticas / egípcias - Arquiteturas difíceis de refatorar, que usam componentes pesados, quem ninguém sabe como foi feita e etc.</li>
<li>Separar a função de cada unidade, não deixando que o produto tenha que saber sobre vendas, por exemplo.</li>
<li>É melhor um design ruim com testes do que um design bom sem testes por que com testes você pode refatorar, agora sem testes a situação já muda bastante.</li>
</ul>
<p>Entre outras coisas muito interessantes que eu não vou mencionar por
que senão meu post vai ficar enorme, mas assista o vídeo e veja as
dicas interessantes que ele dá.</p>
<p>Primeiro <strong>Coffee break</strong> para encontrar os amigos e bater papo! Tinha
bastante gente do Guru-sp por lá (
<a href="http://twitter.com/almeidaricardo" title="Ricardo
Almeida">@almeidaricardo</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/shadow11" title="Ricardo Yasuda">@shadow</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu" title="Rafael Rosa">@rafaelrosafu</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/scalone" title="Thiago Scalone">@scalone</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/bbcoimbra" title="bbcoimbra é o caramba! Esse
é o sceadugenga">@bbcoimbra</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/nelsonmhjr" title="Nelson">@nelsonmhjr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/_bojak" title="Altair">@_bojak</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/cassiomarques" title="Cassio Marques">@cassiomarques</a>,
<a href="http://twitter.com/dcreq" title="Diego Carrion">@dcreq</a> e mais um monte de
gente! ), foi legal para bater um papo com os conhecidos. :D</p>
<p>Só para constar, o Ronaldp Ferraz
(<a href="http://twitter.com/rferraz" title="Ronaldo Ferraz">@rferraz</a>) veio falar
comigo sem crachá e sem cavanhaque, e eu obviamente não conheci, tinha
que se apresentar formalmente ( ou seja, com cavanhaque! O
<a href="http://twitter.com/tinogomes" title="">@tinogomes</a> já aprendeu! haha ). :P</p>
<h4 id="ronaldo-ferraz---criando-sua-própria-linguagem-de-programação">Ronaldo Ferraz - Criando sua própria linguagem de programação</h4>
<p>Palestra muito boa do <a href="http://twitter.com/rferraz" title="Ronaldo Ferraz">@rferraz</a>! :D</p>
<p>O assunto foi bem denso, mas bem interessante, ele mostrou alguns
conceitos e informações interessantes sobre como criar e brincar com a
sua própria linguagem de programação de uma maneira não tão difícil
usando Treetop e Ruby.  Como muitos já sabem o Ronaldo tem
conhecimento infinito em linguagens de programação, portanto a
palestra foi bem legal com vários exemplos em várias linguagens.</p>
<h4 id="joão-s-o-bueno---desenvolvimento-de-jogos-com-python">João S. O. Bueno - Desenvolvimento de jogos com Python</h4>
<p>Puxa vida&hellip;Essa palestra foi um grande <strong>417</strong> ( Código de retorno do
HTTP para <strong>Expectation Failed</strong> ), por que como muitos sabem eu adoro
desenvolvimento de jogos, e fiquei muito feliz por ver uma palestra
desse segmento nesse evento. Outra coisa que me entusiasmou bastante
foi o fato de ser com Python, que assim como Ruby é uma linguagem que
eu gosto bastante, mas em outra palestra que eu tinha visto ( no**
CONISLI 2008** ) o palestrante não foi muito feliz com o
conteúdo. Enfim, e fui com muita vontade de ver essa palestra.</p>
<p>No início da palestra quando falaram o nome do palestrante e eu o vi,
percebi que parecia familiar, e por incrível que pareça&hellip;Era o mesmo
do CONISLI 2008&hellip; Mas até aí tudo bem, agora o nível do pessoal é
diferente e já se passou mais de 1 ano desde a ultima palestra, ou
seja, essa prometia ser bem melhor.</p>
<p>Como puderam ver pelo começo do post, foi um grande engano meu, apesar
de o palestrante falar que ia focar mais em jogos já que o pessoal já
conhecia Python, ele ficou muito em Python e no finalzinho mostrou
alguns joguinhos feitos em PyGame, como se a idéia da palestra fosse
mostrar que Python é legal (que nós já sabemos! :D ) e dá para fazer
jogos tambem.  Enfim&hellip;Me decepcionou&hellip; :(</p>
<h4 id="intervalo-para-almoço">Intervalo para almoço</h4>
<p>O Almoço foi meio corrido por que o evento estava meio atrasado, mas
mesmo assim deu para conversar bastante com a galera do Guru-sp no
shopping ( não me pergunte qual ).</p>
<h4 id="guilherme-silveira-e-adriano-almeida---do-rest-ao-restful">Guilherme Silveira e Adriano Almeida - Do REST ao RESTFul</h4>
<p>Na volta do almoço tivemos uma palestra teórica sobre REST e RESTful,
que por sinal abriu muito a mente sobre o assunto. Mesmo o assunto
sendo teórico o Guilherme Silveira e o Adriano passaram muito bem a
idéia e souberam conduzir bem a palestra para manter o conteúdo bem
dinâmico.</p>
<p>Nando Vieira - Escrevendo testes no JavaScript</p>
<p>Aqui um assunto que vem me interessando cada vez mais, testes! E como
eu sempre gostei de Javascript, a palestra foi bem relevante.
Infelizmente o Nando Vieira não conseguiu mostrar todos os exemplos
que ele tinha planejado, mas foi bem interessante ver o live coding, e
as amostras de testes para determinadas coisas.  Gostei bastante da
syntax do JSpec, não sei como fica a integração dele com o prototype (
que é o que eu estou usando atualmente no trabalho, mesmo preferindo
JQuery ), mas pretendo dar uma chance para ele assim que possível.</p>
<h4 id="luis-cipriani---web-em-tempo-real-com-ruby-e-xmpp">Luis Cipriani - Web em tempo real com Ruby e XMPP</h4>
<p>Bem legal o case que o Cipriani mostrou sobre a sua aplicação da
maratona de basquete, achei muito interessante as ferramentas que ele
usou, e vi que ele soube passar bem as informações sobre o XMPP que
foram necessárias.</p>
<h4 id="coffee-break">Coffee-break</h4>
<p>Agora sim um coffee break que deu um tempinho para conversar com uma
outra galerinha como o <a href="http://twitter.com/rferraz" title="Ronaldo
Ferraz">@rferraz</a>, a <a href="http://twitter.com/narwen" title="Thais Camilo">@narwen</a>, o
<a href="http://twitter.com/fabiokung" title="Fabio Kung">@fabiokung</a> e mais outra
galera.</p>
<h4 id="ricardo-almeida---buscas-poderosas-com-solr">Ricardo Almeida - Buscas poderosas com Solr</h4>
<p>Estava curioso desde o ultimo post do <a href="http://twitter.com/dcreq" title="Diego Carrion">@dcrec</a> sobre o Solr, e a palestra do Ricardo foi o ponto para tirar as minhas dúvidas.
Vi muitas vantagens do Solr sobre o Sphinx e nenhuma do Sphinx sobre o Solr, acho que vale a pena tentar uma migração num futuro não tão distante.</p>
<h4 id="radamés-ajna---arduino---computação-física">Radamés Ajna - Arduino - Computação Física</h4>
<p>A palestra do Radamés foi demais! Além do Arduino ser fantástico, o
Radamés soube apresentar muito bem, mesmo com alguns problemas nos
slides ele mostrou muito bem algumas coisas legais que dá para fazer
com o Arduino, sempre com exemplos muito interessantes de coisas que
já fizeram ou que ele pretende fazer.  A interface para mexer com
arduino realmente não parece ser tão complexa, e eu gostaria mesmo de
ter algum conhecimento em eletronica nesses momentos, mas quem sabe
algum dia eu tiro um tempinho para dar uma brincada. :D</p>
<h4 id="fabio-kung---cloud-computing-e-eu-com-isso">Fabio Kung - Cloud Computing. E eu com isso?</h4>
<p>Para fechar o evento tivemos uma palestra muito legal do Kung
mostrando o que &ldquo;ele acha&rdquo; que é cloud computing, e os tipos de cloud
computing que são oferecidos ( IaaS, PaaS e SaaS ).  Ele mostrou como
funciona e por que são usados os cloud computings atualmente, e como
estão as experiencias dele com cluod computing atualmente. Achei a
palestra bem legal, e é interessante ver as opiniões e experiências de
alguem que realmente está vivendo essa parte de cloud computing.</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>O evento terminou bem atrasado ( mais de 20:00 ), mas valeu muito a
pena ter ido. Há tempos estava sentindo falta de um evento que não
levasse em consideração apenas uma linguagem de programação, algo que
fosse mais pragmático mas que fosse totalmente voltado a
desenvolvimento.</p>
<p>Parabens a todos os organizadores do evento e espero ver vocês
novamente na próxima edição! :D</p>

            <description>Infelizmente não consegui postar sobre os serviços legais do mes de novembro por que eu estava cheio de coisas para fazer ( devido as provas de fim de ano, e meu curso é anual ), portanto não consegui agregar nada para novembro, e muito menos tempo para postar. Mas agora estou eu aqui denovo para postar sobre o que eu achei de legal na internet nesse meio tempo! E lá vamos nós:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Infelizmente não consegui postar sobre os serviços legais do mes de
novembro por que eu estava cheio de coisas para fazer ( devido as provas
de fim de ano, e meu curso é anual ), portanto não consegui agregar nada
para novembro, e muito menos tempo para postar. Mas agora estou eu aqui
denovo para postar sobre o que eu achei de legal na internet nesse meio
tempo! E lá vamos nós:</p>
<h4 id="mocking-bird---wireframes-on-the-fly">Mocking Bird - Wireframes on the fly</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://gomockingbird.com/">Mocking Bird</a> é um site
onde você pode montar wireframes para layouts de sites facilmente, como
se você estivesse fazendo um desenho mas com elementos pré-determinados.
Achei o serviço muito interessante, principalmente para mim que não
manjo nada de fazer design, portanto eu posso dar uma olhada no que eu
quero fazer usando os elementos pré determinados do Mocking Bird e quem
sabe fazer um layout razoável para implementar, apenas revendo as cores
com quem manja de verdade. :)</p>
<h4 id="collecta">Collecta</h4>
<p>O que eu achei interessante do <a href="http://www.collecta.com">Collecta</a> é a
quantidade de coisas diferentes que ele traz na busca, desde twitter
até Github, e isso sem contar que é tudo em tempo real, e você pode
ver realmente o que está acontecendo referente a um determinado
assunto. O serviço parece ser interessante para cobrir eventos, por
que da para ter uma visão geral do que está acontecendo em vários
lugares ao mesmo tempo, ver fotos que postaram, comentários no
twitter, vídeos no youtube e etc.</p>
<h4 id="buzz-volume">Buzz Volume</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://buzzvolume.com/">Buzz Volume</a> foi criado por
dois colegas meus ( o [@dirs](<a href="http://twitter.com/dirs">http://twitter.com/dirs</a> “Dirceu Pauka”)
e o [@mauricio](<a href="http://twitter.com/mauricio">http://twitter.com/mauricio</a> “Mauricio”) ), e eu achei
a idéia bem interessante! O que o site faz é agregar links que estão
sendo bem falados no twitter, assim mantendo o usuário por dentro do que
está sendo mais comentado, ou seja, um bom agregador de coisas famosas.
:) Espero que nesse serviço coloquem uma feature de excluir asssuntos :P
Bem, é isso! Esse post foi simples mas eu compri os serviços legais
desse mes. ;)</p>
<p>Até mes que vem.</p>

            <description>Como muitos sabem eu tive o prazer de estar no show do ACDC aqui no Brasil, que aconteceu no dia 27 de novembro de 2009.
Eu não queria perder esse show por nada, por vários motivos, sendo 2 deles:
 Eu curto pra caramba ACDC Os caras já estão bem velhinhos! Assim como o Ozzy que eu fui e já pensava que podia ser a ultima vez :P  O show foi no estádio do Morumbi:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Como muitos sabem eu tive o prazer de estar no show do ACDC aqui no
Brasil, que aconteceu no dia 27 de novembro de 2009.</p>
<p>Eu não queria perder esse show por nada, por vários motivos, sendo 2
deles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eu curto pra caramba ACDC</li>
<li>Os caras já estão bem velhinhos! Assim como o Ozzy que eu fui e já pensava que podia ser a ultima vez :P</li>
</ul>
<p>O show foi no estádio do Morumbi:
<a href="/images/posts/show_acdc_morumbi.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/show_acdc_morumbi.jpg" alt="Foto do estadio do morumbi visto de fora" title="Estadio do Morumbi"></a></p>
<p>Por sorte consegui chegar relativamente cedo ( 17:00 ) e peguei um
<em>estacionamento</em> razoável ( na casa de alguem que fatura
com isso ) e um lugar razoável na arquibancada (infelizmente nesse
show eu não fui de pista):</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/show_acdc_pista.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/show_acdc_pista.jpg" alt="Foto da pista do estádio do Morumbi visto da arquibancada" title="Pista do estadio do Morumbi"></a></p>
<p>O tempo castigou e tivemos a oportunidade de cantar bastante
Thunderstruck ( a cada relampago começava um: &ldquo;Thuuuuun der!!&rdquo;
). Recebi uma bela de uma chuva enquanto estava na fila para entrar e
outra enquanto esperávamos o show de abertura. Nesse meio tempo eu vi
uma ligeira vantagem de ter ido de moto, por que eu estava com a minha
capa de chuva na mochila e utilizei-a. :D</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/show_acdc_clima.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/show_acdc_clima.jpg" alt="Foto do céu com o sol passando entre as nuvens" title="Clima durante o show"></a></p>
<p>Enfim! Agora vamos ao show. (infelizmente as únicas fotos que eu
tirei que ficaram razoáveis foram antes do show, as outras não dá para
ver nada :P)</p>
<h3 id="abertura">Abertura</h3>
<p>Como muitos sabem, quem abriu o show do ACDC foi o Nazi ( não me
perguntem por que&hellip;Não tenho idéia por que ele foi o escolhido ), que
eu não esperava que fosse legalzinho como foi. Tocou umas musicas meio
clássicas como Raul Seixas, Ira ( não tenho certeza, mas suponho que
era ) e Iggy Pop.</p>
<p>O Show foi bem curto ( cerca de 20 minutos ), mas teve a presença do
Andreas Kisser e a apresentação foi rápida, legal e indolor.</p>
<h3 id="show-do-acdc">Show do ACDC</h3>
<p>Depois de esperar ansiosamente pela abertura do show, eis que as luzes
se apagam e começa um vídeo no telão, onde mostra todos os integrantes
da banda ( ou era só o vocal e o Angus? Não lembro ) dentro de um trem
com algumas mulheres, e o Angus só alimentando a fornalha do trem para
que ela fique no máximo. Duas mulheres amarram o Angus e tentam parar
o trem, quando não conseguem elas pulam fora, e o Angus com o trem a
todo vapor apenas pega sua Guitarra e o trem se colide com o fim da
linha.</p>
<p>Na hora da colisão do trem no vídeo o palco todo se acende e o ACDC
inicia o show tocando Rock N' Roll Train! Uma musica muito legal para
se iniciar! Nesse momento o cenário já está enfeitado com uma grande
locomotiva que fica soltando fumaça enquanto eles tocam.</p>
<p>Abaixo vai o set list que foi tocado durante o show com os meus devidos comentários:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hell Ain&rsquo;t A Bad Place To Be</strong> - Musica que eu gosto bastante!</li>
<li><strong>Back In Black</strong> - Obviamente eles não podiam deixar de tocar essa musica que é um grande clássico do ACDC! Tive até que ligar para o meu primo para ele ouvir um pedaço! Essa musica é boa demais!</li>
<li><strong>Big Jack</strong> - Essa como outras musicas que são relacionadas a mulheres tem uma coisa muito legal, que é mostrar várias mulheres do show! :P</li>
<li><strong>Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap</strong> - Nada como gritar Done Dirt Cheap! Depois de um grande Dirty Deeeeeeeeedsss! :P</li>
<li><strong>Thunderstruck</strong> - Outra das musicas muito esperadas do ACDC, que já começa com um solinho bem legal do Angus. Uma das coisas que eu gostei pra caramba nessa musica é o aparecimento perfeito do relâmpago no telão quando todos gritavam &ldquo;Thunnder&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Black Ice</strong> - Uma musica que eu ouvia já faz um tempo e gosto bastante!</li>
<li><strong>The Jack</strong> - She&rsquo;s got the Jack! Outra musica que mostra mulheres no telão, e nessa teve até um meio strip tease do Angus ( ele é doentão&hellip;hehehe )</li>
<li><strong>Hells Bells</strong> - Outra integração fantástica com o cenário! Antes de começar a musica desce um grande sino no palco, e o vocalista corre pelo grande palco que foi montado pelo meio da galera e se pendura no sino, dando o primeiro toque do sino da musica. Coisa Linda! :D</li>
<li><strong>War Machine</strong> - War Machiiiiiine! ( Só quem conhece as musicas do ACDC que entende essas falas que eu coloco antes de comentar sobre a musica, por que as musicas do ACDC sempre tem uma fala que a galera se junta para falar como um eco depois do vocalista ). Essa é uma das musicas que eu mais gosto do Black Ice, juntamente com Skies on Fire ( que não está no set list do show ).</li>
<li><strong>Dog Eat Dog</strong> - Essa foi uma surpresa! Gosto pra caramba dessa msuica, mas achei que eles não fossem tocar, e tocaram! :D</li>
<li><strong>Anything Goes</strong> - Musica legal e eu ouço bastante, mas não é uma das minhas preferidas.</li>
<li><strong>You Shook Me All Night Long</strong> - Musica de mulheres novamente, e não me lembro se foi nessa mas teve uma mina que lembrou a essência dos bons e velhos shows do ACDC que as mulheres levantavam a camiseta! :D:D:D</li>
<li><strong>TNT</strong> - Hey! Hey! Hey! T&hellip;.N&hellip;.T! Obviamente, mais uma das clássicas do ACDC que não podia faltar num show de qualidade como esse!</li>
<li><strong>Whole Lotta Rosie</strong> - E lá vamos a mais uma parte muito foda do cenário! Surge uma boneca gigante da Rosie no cenário ( com os peitos gigantes por sinal ), e fazendo um movimento de bater o pé que ficou muito legal.</li>
<li><strong>Let There Be Rock</strong> - Boa e velha essência do Rock N' Roll! Me de as luzes&hellip;Me de o som&hellip;Me de a bateria&hellip;Me de a guitarra&hellip;Que se faça o Rock n' Roll!</li>
<li><strong>Highway To Hell</strong> - Clássica e muito foda! Não tem o que dizer!</li>
<li><strong>For Those About To Rock</strong> - Essa para mim foi a melhor musica do show! A musica é muito boa, a interação com o cenário ficou perfeita, e foi a musica final para fechar. Foi muito legal ver isso: For those about to rock&hellip;. Fire ( um canhão que fica atrás do palco dispara! ) Weeeee saluuuuute yoooou!</li>
</ul>
<p>E a cada vez que tinha um &ldquo;Fire!&ldquo;ou um &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; um dos canhões
disparava, até que no ultimo &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; os 6 canhões disparam para fechar
o show! Fantástico!</p>
<p>Obviamente em algum lugar do show teve um solo gigante do Angus com
direito a plataforma móvel para ele solar mais alto. :D</p>
<h4 id="conclusões">Conclusões</h4>
<p>Foi um dos melhores shows que eu já fui ( senão o melhor ) e quem
perdeu a chance de ir não sei se terá outra, e perdeu um show
fascinante para quem curte. Eles tocaram as musicas que eu mais gosto(
Eu gosto de uma infinidade de outras, mas as que tocaram foram todas
de meu agrado, todas que eu gosto ).</p>

            <description>Esse é um post para relatar como foi o Rails Summit Latin America desse ano! 😀 Já começo o post com um grande #win para a organização do #railssummit, por que eles tem tomadas para todos e wi-fi liberado para todos os participantes, o que ajuda para que pessoas como eu possam ficar postando no blog durante o evento, :) Vamos ao evento!
Rails Insurgency – Chad Fowler A palestra foi muito interessante e o Chad Fowler falou sobre como é a dificuldade de implantar uma aplicação Rails em uma grande empresa quando você tem grandes gerentes que te enchem de perguntas do tipo: “Rails faz X?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Esse é um post para relatar como foi o Rails Summit Latin America desse
ano! 😀 Já começo o post com um grande #win para a organização do
#railssummit, por que eles tem tomadas para todos e wi-fi liberado para
todos os participantes, o que ajuda para que pessoas como eu possam
ficar postando no blog durante o evento, :) Vamos ao evento!</p>
<h4 id="rails-insurgency--chad-fowler">Rails Insurgency – Chad Fowler</h4>
<p>A palestra foi muito interessante e o Chad Fowler falou sobre como é a
dificuldade de implantar uma aplicação Rails em uma grande empresa
quando você tem grandes gerentes que te enchem de perguntas do tipo:
“Rails faz X?, “Rails faz Y” até que voc6e responda um não para que ele
possa dizer: “Aháá! Então não podemos usar”. O Chad Fowler já foi um
desses gerentes e decidiu passar a experiencia de um desses gerentes e
por que eles pensam dessa maneira.</p>
<p>Uma outra coisa bem legal que o Chad comentou foi sobre fazer um modelo
junto com o seu cliente na hora do planejamento, até por que você
consegue fazer isso facilmente com o Rails e até mostrar uma pequena
funcionalidade com um Scaffold sem muito transtorno, e seu cliente pode
facilmente ver se é isso mesmo que ele está pensando.</p>
<h4 id="gregg-pollack--na-vanguarda-da-performance-em-rails">Gregg Pollack – Na vanguarda da performance em Rails</h4>
<p>O Greg Pollack falou sobre page scaling Rails, comentando sobre uma
grande quantidade de plugins para medir e ajudar a corrigir alguns
problemas de escalabilidade que são detectados. Foi apresentado
ferramentas para melhorar performance de banco de dados, para verificar
quais <!-- raw HTML omitted -->queries<!-- raw HTML omitted --> que podem ser melhoradas, onde podem ser
incluídos índices e outras coisas bem interessantes.</p>
<p>No fim da palestra ele falou sobre o <a href="http://madmimi.com/">madmimi</a>
que ajuda a lidar com um dos grandes gargalos de aplicações, que é
quando se tem que trabalhar com grandes listas de e-mails.</p>
<p>Para saber os outros assuntos que o Greg falou é só ver no blog do
EnvyLabs: <a href="http://blog.envylabs.com/summit">http://blog.envylabs.com/summit</a></p>
<h4 id="carlos-brando--como-o-rails-funciona-por-dentro">Carlos Brando – Como o Rails funciona por dentro</h4>
<p>Agora começa o problema por que temos que escolher uma palestra e eu
fiquei em dúvida entre a palestra do Ilya Grigorick e a do <a href="http://twitter.com/carlosbrando" title="Carlos Brando">Carlos
Brando</a>, mas no fim das contas resolvi
assistir a do Carlos.</p>
<p>O Carlos Brando falou sobre como o Rails funciona por dentro, usando a
sua experiência na criação de um framework (que ele está fazendo na
nova empresa que está trabalhando), ele falou um pouco sobre como o
Rails trata as requisições, como utilizar as coisas certas de Rails
quando se está fazendo um framework, e comentou um pouco sobre o
framework que ele está criando como exemplo.</p>
<p>Achei a palestra muito superficial…Achei que o Carlos fosse pegar pesado
mostrando bastante coisa do Rails, mas ele decidiu mostrar algo mais
simples pois ao mostrar para algumas pessoas percebeu que elas estavam
achando meio massante. Enfim, como ele mesmo disse, não dá para agradar
a todos, mas na minha opinião a palestra foi fraca :(</p>
<h4 id="josé-valim--aprenda-a-customizar-os-geradores-do-rails-30">José Valim – Aprenda a customizar os geradores do Rails 3.0</h4>
<p>A palestra do José Valim foi bem legal! Ele falou sobre o Thor e sobre
os geradores do Rails 3, como você poderá facilmente customiza-los e
como o thor pode te ajudar em suas aplicações.</p>
<p>Ele mostrou um pouco do motivo de se trocar utilizar o thor, e por que
os antigos geradores são ruins do jeito que estão. Um exemplo legal foi
mostrar como um plugin tem que fazer para gerar coisas, tomando como
exemplo o RSpec, que com um spec_model vai ter que gerar migrations
tambem, sendo que não é do escopo do RSpec ter que se preocupar com
migrations, mas do jeito que está atualmente ele apenas pode trocar o
<code>script/generate model</code> pelo <code>script/generate rspec_model</code>. Utilizando
o exemplo anterior como base foi mostrado como os novos geradores vão
ajudar nas tarefas dos plugins a partir de agora.</p>
<p>Gostei da palestra e acho que o José Valim conseguiu passar bem o que
ele queria. :)</p>
<h4 id="david-chelimsky--rspec-e-cucumber-alem-do-básico">David Chelimsky – RSpec e Cucumber alem do básico</h4>
<p>A palestra do chelimsky foi sobre o uso do <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>
e do <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>, que na minha opinião foi bem
similar a palestra do ano passado, mas mesmo assim mostrou algumas
boas práticas sobre RSpec que foram interessantes.</p>
<p>Eu ainda tive a chance de conversar com o Chelimsky no final da palestra
para fazer umas perguntas sobre o Spork e como melhorar o tempo de
execução dos meus testes que demoram muito para serem executados,
tornando o desenvolvimento com o autospec não tão bom quando poderia
ser.</p>
<h4 id="fabio-akita--agile-além-do-caos">Fabio Akita – Agile, além do caos</h4>
<p>A palestra do Akita foi uma grande viagem de pensamentos aleatórios dele
sobre a teoria do caos baseado nos estudos que ele tem feito nos últimos
tempos. Eu achei que foi muita informação para um curto período de tempo
para as pessoas, mas quem conseguiu abstrair muita coisa e entender qual
foi a finalidade da palestra deve ter gostado bastante, por que a idéia
central é bem interessante. :)</p>
<h4 id="matt-aimonetti--o-futuro-do-ruby--rails">Matt Aimonetti – O Futuro do Ruby &amp; Rails</h4>
<p>O Matt falou sobre as novidades que virão no Rails 3, sobre o que poderá
ser incorporado do merb e o quanto “plugável” o Rails 3 será. Ele não
falou apenas de Rails, mas falou tambem um pouco de Ruby e quais são as
novidades em termos de velocidade.</p>
<h4 id="desconferência">Desconferência</h4>
<p>E chegou a hora que muitos estavam esperando, a desconferência! 😀</p>
<p>Na ultima desconferência o Elomar deu show falando um pouco sobre
grupos de estudo, e muita gente estava esperando coisas legais para
esse ano.</p>
<p>Teve muita coisa interessante, mas infelizmente não pude ficar até o
final por causa da minha faculdade, mas o que pude ver foi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pessoal do Guru-sp apresentando o grupo e falando sobre o crescimento e futuras atividades (eu fui o primeiro a falar! 😀)</li>
<li>George Guimarães falando do Devise</li>
<li>Aldo França contando sua história para aprender Rails e fazendo um blog em 15 minutos ( com 11 anos de idade )</li>
<li>Guilherme Chapiewsky e Henrique Bastos falando sobre os eventos e grupos que eles participam no Rio</li>
</ul>
<p>Sei que teve muito mais coisas legais alem disso, mas essas foram as
unias que eu pude ver e achei todas bem legais! 😀</p>
<p>Acho muito interessante essa idéia de desconferência, pois serve tanto
para integrar o pessoal e dar risada quanto para apresentar projetos
interessantes e muito úteis para alguns.</p>
<p>Sem contar que eu ganhei um Ipod nano da
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> em um sorteio pouco antes
da desconferência. 😀</p>
<h4 id="manhã-do-primeiro-dia">Manhã do primeiro dia</h4>
<p>Agora vem a parte triste…Não pude estar no evento no segundo dia de
manhã.  :(</p>
<p>O <a href="http://ikwa.com.br">ikwa</a> não liberou todos os programadores para ficar
lá em tempo integral, portanto fizemos um revezamento, e para mim
ficou o segundo dia de manhã.</p>
<p>Perdi duas palestras que eu gostaria muito de assistir. A primeira é do
<a href="http://twitter.com/cv">Carlos Vilela</a> que falou sobre o uso do Ruby na ThoughtWorks e a
segunda é do <a href="http://simplesideias.com.br/" title="Simples Ideias - Por Nando Vieira">Nando Vieira</a> que estava falando do Ruby 1.9.</p>
<p>Uma coisa que me animou um pouco foi saber que as palestras eram
simultâneas, portanto eu ia perder uma de qualquer jeito.</p>
<h4 id="marcos-tapajós--couchdb-no-rails">Marcos Tapajós – CouchDB no Rails</h4>
<p>Como não pude estar no evento no segundo dia de manhã eu já cheguei
direto para a palestra do <a href="http://improveit.com.br/empresa/tapajos" title="Tapajós na improve-it">Tapajós</a> sobre CouchDB, que por sinal foi bem
interessante! O Tapajós mostrou um pouco de como é trabalhar com CouchDB
e como deve ser a mudança de paradigma da saída de um banco relacional
para ir para um banco orientado a documentos.</p>
<p>Como o próprio Tapajós disse, a idéia da palestra dele era dar um
Overview do couchDB e depois abrir para perguntas para tirar as dúvidas
do pessoal, e na minha opinião ficou muito bom! 😀</p>
<h4 id="bruno-miranda--rails-não-escala">Bruno Miranda – Rails não escala</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://twitter.com/brupm" title="Twitter do Bruno Miranda">Bruno Miranda</a> apresentou “juntamente” com o Jason Seifer
(infelizmente o <a href="http://jasonseifer.com/" title="Jason Seifer">Jason Seifer</a> não pode estar no railssummit por
problemas com a viagem, portanto apenas enviou vídeos da parte que ele
ia falar) sobre “Rails não escala”, falando sobre a aplicação que está
em baixo do canal de audio do MSN e como eles conseguem manter uma infra
escalável usando Rails.</p>
<h4 id="vinicius-teles--do-serviço-ao-produto">Vinicius Teles – Do serviço ao produto</h4>
<p>Uma das melhores palestras do Rails Summit ( as palestras não técnicas
são sempre as mais marcantes, por melhor que sejam as técnicas… ), onde
o Vinícius contou sua história passando por bons e maus momentos com a
sua empresa, começando com serviços e terminando em produto.</p>
<p>Coisas interessantes da palestra do Vinícius foi o grande enfoque em
“reserva”, ou seja, sempre tenha uma reserva em caixa para segurar a sua
empresa nos piores momentos ou ajudar quando vem aquela grande
oportunidade. Apenas investir em passivo ( como carros por exemplo )
quando isso não for um grande empecilho, por que no começo um carro (por
exemplo) só vai te trazer prejuízo com desvalorização e manutenção.</p>
<p>O Vinícius deu ótimas dicas para quem quer começar uma empresa, várias
dicas de experiencias que ele passou, e me animou muito a preparar as
coisas par a empresa que eu vou abrir no futuro. Acho que já posso
começar a me preparar. 😛</p>
<h4 id="obie-fernandez--dominando-a-arte-do-desenvolvimento-de-aplicações">Obie Fernandez – Dominando a arte do desenvolvimento de aplicações</h4>
<p>Outra palestra no mesmo nível da palestra do Vinícius ( também não
técnica ), portanto muito boa! 😀</p>
<p>O Obie Fernandez falou sobre como dominar o desenvolvimento de
aplicações, e achei muito interessante os exemplos que ele passou sobre
musica, comentando da quantidade de esforço de um grupo de músicos em
termos de horas e o que isso implicava em seu nível. Ainda sobre o tempo
de estudo, não é “apenas estudo” por que pratica não leva a perfeição,
“prática perfeita leva a perfeição”. Programação é como musica, é sempre
bom pegar musicas dos outros para estudar, por que assim você pode
aprender sutilezas para fazer a sua.</p>
<p>A palestra do Obie assim como a do Vinícius teve frases chave como:</p>

<li>Se eu estiver trabalhando e um dia descobrir que eu não estou feliz
eu simplesmente saio</li>
<li>Fuck the enterprize ( muito boa! haha )</li>
<li>Pratica não leva a perfeição, pratica perfeita leva a perfeição</li>
</ul>
<p>Gostei bastante da palestra, e bateu certinho com algumas coisas que
estou pensando para os meus estudos para os próximos tempos.</p>
<h4 id="horaextra">#horaextra</h4>
<p>O #horaextra foi muito legal! Tivemos um problema com o primeiro bar
que fomos por que não podiam entrar menores e nem com short, portanto o
Mergulhão e o Aldo ficariam de fora, então o pessoal foi para outro bar,
que ficava do lado desse e lotamos o lugar 😛</p>
<p>Como o bar era pequeno para a quantidade de pessoas, as coisas demoravam
um pouco para chegar, mas nada que uma boa conversa não pudesse ajudar
você a relevar isso. A mesa era gigante, mas as pessoas que a voz
alcançava eram: <a href="http://twitter.com/carlosbrando" title="Carlos Brando">Carlos Brando</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/r4f4e1" title="Rafael">r4f4e1</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/vinibaggio" title="Vinicius Baggio">Vinícius Baggio</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/shadow11" title="Ricardo Yasuda">Shadow</a> e
<a href="http://twitter.com/agaelebe" title="Hugo Borges">Agaelebe</a>.</p>
<p>Batemos papo por um bom tempo, com participação de mais uma galera (
<a href="http://akitaonrails.com">Akita</a>, <a href="http://rafaelrosafu.com/" title="Rafael Rosa Fu">Rafael Rosa</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scalone" title="Thiago Scalone">Thiago Scalone</a> …. ), e acabei saindo de lá
mais de 00:00.</p>
<p>Aqui chega o fim do evento e o que fica são os bons momentos passados
por lá, o conhecimento adquirido e a vontade de participar novamente no
ano que vem! Parabens aos organizadores ( e patrocinadores! ) do evento,
por que ficou ótimo!</p>

            <description>Já estava me esquecendo de postar sobre os serviçoes legais desse mes! :P
Estava com poucos quando lembrei, mas não demorou muito para que eu lembrasse de alguns muito bons. Vamos lá!
yUML&amp;lt; O yUML é um serviço para se criar UML facilmente utilizando apenas uma URL com determinadas marcações. O caike que me mostrou no ultimo post quando eu tinha mencionado sobre criação deUML. Valeu Caike!
Gliffy Continuando em diagramas e UML temos o Gliffy que também faz uma grande quantidade de diagramas diferentes.</description>

<h4 id="pivotal-tracker">Pivotal Tracker</h4>
<p>Para quem não connhece, o
<a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/" title="Pivotal Tracker">PivotalTracker</a> é
uma ferramenta para gestão de projetos utilizando
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)" title="Scrum na
Wikipedia">Scrum</a>! Ele utiliza várias ferramentas que são muito úteis quando
se tem uma equipe que está aplicando a metodologia Scrum, como gráfico
burndown, média automática de pontos por semana, agendamento
automático de tarefas de acordo com a quantidade de pontos por sprint
da equipe e mais outras coisas bem interessantes! Já trabalhei
utilizando o Pivotal e recomendo!</p>
<h4 id="scrumy">Scrumy</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://scrumy.com" title="Scrumy">Scrumy</a> é outra ferramenta muito
interessante e bem simples para se trabalhar com Scrum, principalmente
para equipes remotas. Ele cria um kanban board virtual, onde você pode
arrastar os post-its para as próximas áreas ( todo, wip, verify, done
), e ter uma visão mais ampla das atividades facilmente.</p>
<p>Esse mes é só isso! Espero que seja útil para alguém!</p>

            <title>Instalando e configurando o monit</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/monit/</link>

            <guid>https://pothix.com/posts/monit/</guid>
            <description>Esses dias eu peguei para instalar o monit no servidor da empresa que eu trabalho e sofri um pouquinho com algumas coisas básicas, portanto decidi postar aqui para que seja útil para quem quer começar a utilizar o monit.
Se você usa Ubuntu, você pode fazer download do Monit por apt-get:
sudo apt-get install monit  Se você não usa Ubuntu ou quer a ultima versão do Monit, então faça download do tar.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Esses dias eu peguei para instalar o monit no servidor da empresa que
eu trabalho e sofri um pouquinho com algumas coisas básicas, portanto
decidi postar aqui para que seja útil para quem quer começar a
utilizar o monit.</p>
<p>Se você usa Ubuntu, você pode fazer download do Monit por apt-get:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install monit
</code></pre>
<p>Se você não usa Ubuntu ou quer a ultima versão do Monit, então faça
download do tar.gz <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit/download/">http://mmonit.com/monit/download/</a> e compile.</p>
<p>O Monit tem 2 dependencias:</p>
<ul>
<li>bison</li>
<li>flex</li>
</ul>
<p>Eu resolvi as 2 facilmente utilizando o próprio apt-get:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install bison flex</code></p>
<p>Agora é só partir para compilar os fontes! ( prefiro compilar dos
fontes em certas ocasiões para pegar a ultima versão ):</p>
<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>E pronto! Lá está o seu monit instalado! Agora é o momento da
configuração. :D</p>
<p>O monit utiliza o arquivo chamado .monitrc para saber o que deve ser
monitorado e com quais parâmetros, portanto crie um arquivo na sua
$HOME com o nome de <code>.monitrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>vim $HOME/.monitrc
</code></pre>
<p>Claro que usarei o vim para isso (qual outro poderia ser né? haha).
Agora você deve criar o seu próprio arquivo de configuração dizendo
o que o monit deve monitorar e quais critérios deve usar.</p>
<p>Você pode pegar alguns exemplos de arquivos
<a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/browser/trunk/examples/monitrc" title="Arquivo do pessoal do mongrel">como o do pessoal do mongrel</a>,
ou até mesmo <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit/documentation/monit.html#how_to_monitor" title=".monitrc exemplo na documentação oficial">da documentação oficial do monit</a>
e criar o seu baseado nele. A syntax desse arquivo é de fácil
entendimento. :)</p>
<p>Para e-mails eu utilizei a minha conta do Google Apps com a seguinte configuração:</p>
<pre><code>set mailserver smtp.gmail.com port 587 username &quot;pothix@pothix.com&quot; password &quot;abc123&quot; using tlsv1, with timeout 15 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Com todas as configurações arrumadas o monit já pode ser iniciado:</p>
<pre><code>monit
</code></pre>
<p>E agora você já tem vários comandos para utilizar, é só dar uma lida na
<a href="http://mmonit.com/monit/documentation/monit.html#general_operation" title="Comandos do monit">documentação do monit para ver o que é possível fazer</a>.</p>
<p>Espero que seja útil para quem ainda não usa nenhuma ferramente de
monitoração e gostou do monit. :)</p>

            <description>E lá vamos nós novamente para mais um post sobre os serviços legais que eu encontrei esse mes.
Creately O Creately é um site para se fazer diagramas! Eu estava procurando por isso faz bastante tempo e nunca tinha achado um satisfatório, mas esse parece ser muito bom!
Com ele é possível fazer uma grande quantidade coisas, como diagramas de classe, fluxograma, esqueletos de layout e mais um monte de coisas legais e depois exportar para alguns formatos.</description>

<p>O <a href="http://creately.com/" title="Creately">Creately</a> é  um site para se fazer
diagramas! Eu  estava procurando por  isso faz bastante tempo  e nunca
tinha achado um satisfatório, mas esse parece ser muito bom!</p>
<p>Com ele é possível fazer uma grande quantidade coisas, como diagramas

<h4 id="groove-shark">Groove Shark</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/" title="Groove Shark">Groove Shark</a> é um
site fantástico para se ouvir musicas! Sabe quando você está na
faculdade na internet pesquisando sobre um trabalho e tem aquela saída
para fone no computador e você pode ouvir musicas mas não tem um lugar
legal? Acesse o GrooveShark faça uma pequena playlist e se divirta.</p>
<p>Gostei por que eles tem uma grande variedade de musicas lá e a
interface é bem leve e bonita.</p>
<h4 id="tutsplus">TutsPlus</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://tutsplus.com/" title="TutsPlus">TutsPlus</a> é um site que possui uma
grande quantidade de tutoriais de qualidade sobre vários tipos de
assuntos. O que achei interessante é que os materiais são divididos em
sites diferentes e todos os tutoriais são moderados, portanto quase
todo o conteúdo que você vê por lá é de muito boa qualidade.</p>
<p>Eu acompanho as atualizações do
<a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/" title="NetTuts+">NetTuts</a> por que sempre tem um
conteúdo que me interessa referente a web, seja Javascrit, PHP, Rails
ou várias outras coisas interessantes.</p>
<p>Bem, é isso! Espero que esses links sejam úteis para mais alguem além de mim! :D</p>

            <title>Meme: Game design ao Extremo</title>

            <description>Estou escrevendo esse post por que fui convocado para esse meme pelo Bruno Croci, que foi meu parceiro no desenvolvimento de um dos games vencedores do GameJam do itaú cultural, o Robotz Warehouse.
A idéia do post é mostrar alguns games interessantes e falar a sua opinião sobre eles. As regras são:
 Liste quantos jogos em Flash quiser. Preferencialmente aqueles que, por algum motivo de design chamaram sua atenção. Diga o que desses jogos te chamou a atenção, seja em quantas linhas quiser.</description>

o <a href="http://github.com/PotHix/RobotzWarehouse" title="Robotz Warehouse">Robotz Warehouse</a>.</p>
<p>A idéia do post é mostrar alguns games interessantes e falar a sua

<ul>
<li>Liste quantos jogos em Flash quiser. Preferencialmente aqueles que, por algum motivo de design chamaram sua atenção.</li>
<li>Diga o que desses jogos te chamou a atenção, seja em quantas linhas quiser.</li>
<li>Repasse para outros blogs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Há algum tempo eu gostava muito de ficar jogando jogos de lógica em
flash na internet, mas de um tempo para cá eu parei devido a correria,
mas com esse post eu consegui reviver muitos jogos legais. São eles:</p>
<h4 id="orbox">Orbox</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://www.funny-games.biz/orbox.html" title="Orbox">orbox</a> é um jogo
muito legal, e o que mais me impressionou nele é a forma que ele
consegue prender o jogador por ser um jogo bonito, que parece ser
muito fácil mas mostra que você precisa realmente usar a cabeça para
poder chegar a terminar o jogo. Eu joguei por algumas madrugadas para
poder chegar ao fim! =)</p>
<h4 id="cowmaze">Cowmaze</h4>
<p><a href="http://gprime.net/game.php/cowmaze" title="Cowmaze">Cowmaze</a> é um jogo
fantástico! Acho que tem uma idéia simples e interessante, que também
explora a lógica como parte principal do game e isso sempre me
atrai. O game é muito bem desenhado, apesar de ter um tema mais
infantil, é muito bem feito e bonito de se olhar.</p>
<p>Esse game é bem completo, possui vários níveis de dificuldade, sendo
que algo que parece ser simples de ser resolvido se torna totalmente
complexo se você não escolher o caminho certo.</p>
<p>Uma coisa que esse game tem de vantagem em cima do Orbox? Passwords!
Pude jogar esse jogo por muito tempo, por que ele sempre tinha um
password para eu conseguir voltar de onde eu estava, enquanto o Orbox
sempre me fazia recomeçar tudo novamente.</p>
<h4 id="mystery-of-time-and-space---motas">Mystery of time and Space - M.O.T.A.S</h4>
<p>O que mais me chamou a atenção
<a href="http://server-admin.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/motas/" title="Mystery of time and Space">nesse game</a>
(além de ser um jogo de investigação, é claro) foi a
história e o ambiente ao qual o jogo introduz o jogador. Esse jogo
consegue usar o fato de que você tem que explorar um cenário e coloca
você realmente dentro do game entendendo que você está realmente
confuso dentro do jogo.</p>
<p>Eu realmente recomendo jogar e tentar chegar até o final! ;)</p>
<h4 id="chronotron">Chronotron</h4>
<p>A idéia do
<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Scarybug/chronotron">chronotron</a>
é fantástica, e me foi recomendada por
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/raltimari" title="Rubens Altimari">um físico</a> que
falou que a idéia dele é realmente legal e para quem realmente entende
de física vai reparar muitas coisas legais.</p>
<p>O jogo é simples mas é muito divertido! Mais uma vez ele trabalha a
parte lógica e faz com que você tente muitas vezes fazer as suas
cópias trabalharem da maneira correta, o que por sua vez é muito
desafiador e divertido :)</p>
<h4 id="light-bot">Light Bot</h4>
<p><a href="http://chat.kongregate.com/gamez/0002/2915/live/BillBotKong.swf">Essegame</a>
mostra muito bem como é ser um programador. Você tem
tipos de ação e você deve usá-las da melhor maneira possível para
fazer com que o robô chegue a seu destino, e como sempre, as ações são
limitadas e você precisa fazer uso de funções para utilizar as ações
da manera correta, sempre reutilizando as ações dentro de funções.</p>
<p>Esse jogo é ótimo para programadores (seja
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</a>)
por fazer você pensar em como fazer as coisas corretas, e tambem para
mostrar para as pessoas que não programam como é mais ou menos
programar. É um game que realmente vale uma olhada, seja você
programador ou não.</p>
<p>Esses foram os games que me prenderam por um longo tempo e realmente
valem a pena de ser lembrados. Agora eu devo indicar mais pessoas para
continuar esses posts, e os indicados são:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://infog.casoft.info/" title="Blog do Infog">Infog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://leticiando.tumblr.com/" title="Blog da Letícia Figueira">Leticiando</a></li>

<li><a href="http://rinaldi.coffeebreakers.org/blog/" title="Blog do Mario Rinaldi">Mario Rinaldi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Espero que apareçam outros posts para dar sequencia e para eu conhecer
jogos legais que estão perdidos por aí, além de analizar idéias legais
para games.</p>

            <description>Eu sempre digo que a faculdade me atrasa bastante, por que eu não consigo estudar/fazer um monte de coisas que eu tenho vontade para me dedicar as coisas que a faculdade me obriga a fazer. Se a faculdade é bom ou ruim não é discussão para esse post, mas resolvi postar a quantidade de coisas que eu consegui fazer nessas férias aproveitando que eu não precisava me preocupar com a faculdade, assim deixando o tempo da noite e a cabeça menos preocupada:</description>

nessas férias&rdquo; :P</p>

            <description>Aqui começa uma série de artigos sobre por que eu gosto de usar o VIM para programar.
Uma das primeiras coisas que eu gostaria de comentar é sobre a quebra de paradigma que você deve ter quando começa a usar um editor como o vim que tem vários modos de operação, ou seja, não é mais apenas digitar, pois cada modo de operação tem o seu modo de agir. Os modos de operação são os seguintes:</description>

<p>Uma das primeiras coisas que eu gostaria de comentar é sobre a quebra
de paradigma que você deve ter quando começa a usar um editor como o
vim que tem vários modos de operação, ou seja, não é mais apenas
digitar, pois cada modo de operação tem o seu modo de agir. Os modos
de operação são os seguintes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inserção</li>
<li>Visual</li>
<li>Normal</li>
<li>Comandos</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="modo-de-inserção">Modo de inserção</h4>
<p>O modo de inserção é um modo simples para se inserir texto sem nada
muito complexo, você se sentirá usando um notepad se usar somente o
modo de inserção.</p>
<h4 id="modo-visual">Modo visual</h4>
<p>Com o modo visual você pode selecionar facilmente trechos de texto,
linhas inteiras e blocos de texto. Um exemplo bem legal de uso de blocos no Vim
<a href="http://eustaquiorangel.com/posts/selecoes_de_blocos_com_o_vim" title="Uso de blocos no Vim">pode ser visto no blog do TaQ</a>.</p>
<h4 id="modo-normal">Modo normal</h4>
<p>Agora sim as coisas ficam legais! No modo normal, que é o modo que
você mais fica no Vim, você pode fazer as coisas mais interessantes!</p>
<p>Ok, falei&hellip;falei&hellip;e não mostrei o por que o modo normal é tão
poderoso né? Bem, são coisas como essas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dentro de aspas podemos dar um ci&quot; e ele já excluiria todo o conteúdo que está dentro das aspas e deixaria você em modo de inserção para inserir um novo conteúdo</li>
<li>Parar em cima do número 20 e quer adicionar 7? Apenas faça <code>ctrl+a</code> e ele fará a soma em cima desse número</li>
<li>E se ao invés de soma vc quiser a subtração dos valores acima? Apenas faça <code>ctrl+x</code> e ele fará a soma em cima desse número</li>
<li>É claro que você não vai ficar repetindo esse monte de coisas que você fez aí em cima se tiver várias ocorrências e você não quiser fazer um &ldquo;find and replace&rdquo;, por que você pode usar o . (ponto) para fazer a sua ultima ação novamente.</li>
<li>Quer trocar as linhas de posição? Moleza! ddp ( sendo dd para excluir uma linha, que fica no buffer, e p para colar a linha do buffer )</li>
<li>Está no começo da linha e quer ir para aquele parentese? f( e pronto, você já estará lá!</li>
<li>Quer ir para um caracter antes do parentese? t( ta na mão! :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enfim&hellip;Tem muitas outras coisas legais a se fazer sem que você precise tirar a sua mão do teclado.</p>
<h4 id="modo-de-comandos">Modo de comandos</h4>
<p>E o modo de comandos é onde você tem uma segunda linguagem de
programação alem da que você está usando pra programar, e lá você pode
tanto usar comandos de loop como:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1,10) | put ='192.168.0.'.i | endfor
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OBS</strong>: créditos ao Sergio <a href="http://vivaotux.blogspot.com/2009/02/gerando-listas-no-vim.html" title="Post sobre loop no vim">nesse post</a></p>
<p>Que imprime uma faixa de IPs de 192.168.0.1 até 192.168.0.10.</p>
<p>Ou você pode alterar as funcionalidades e opções do editor utilizando
<code>:set</code> ou outras comandos interessantes.</p>
<h4 id="use-o-vim-como-ele-foi-feito-para-ser-usado">Use o Vim como ele foi feito para ser usado</h4>
<p>Outra quebra de paradigma que deve ser usada é usar &ldquo;<strong>hjkl</strong>&rdquo; para se
movimentar pelo texto, sempre usando os dedos indicadores sobre o &ldquo;j&rdquo;
e o &ldquo;f&rdquo; que é o padrão de digitação, e você vai ser que você vai
precisar tirar a mão do teclado para fazer outras coisas poucas vezes,
e pelo menos para mim as coisas parecem bem mais fáceis. Isso lhe
força a sempre usar <code>esc</code> (ou <code>ctrl+[</code>) após fazer alguma coisa,
deixando o modo normal livre para uso.</p>
<h4 id="customização">Customização</h4>
<p>O Vim pode ser facilmente incrementado com plugins, temas e outras
coisas que tornam ele bem customizável, e você pode deixar ele com a
sua cara. Atalhos são facilmente configuráveis no seu .vimrc, assim
como configurações como highlight de busca, espaçamento para scroll, e
mais muuuiiitas opções que obviamente não caberão nesse post.</p>
<h4 id="concluindo">Concluindo</h4>
<p>A idéia desse post é falar que para se usar vim você precisa estar
disposto a mudar muita coisa que você sabe, e a curva de aprendizado
não é uma das mais fáceis, mas quando você está no meio dela você
percebe o quanto é legal e acaba se viciando no negócio! hehe</p>
<p>Como o Vim é bem configurável pode acontecer de você ficar tentando
implementar ele para ficar igual ao seu antigo paradigma ( modo de
inserção para sempre ), mas isso não vai de ajudar muito e vai te
abstrair toda a força do Vim.</p>
<p>É isso! Nos próximos posts sobre vim pretendo postar dicas,
referências legais e falar bem mais aprofundadamente de algumas
ferramentas.</p>

            <description>Como alguns sabem no final de semana passado ( dias 7, 8 e 9 ) eu participei do GameJam do Itaú cultural.
Nesse evento os participantes tinham que formar equipes de até 4 pessoas e fazer um jogo em 48 horas, sendo que o tema ao qual o jogo devia responder só seria passado na sexta feira as 19, e teríamos até as 19 horas do domingo para entregar o jogo pronto utilizando qualquer plataforma para desenvolvimento.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/images/posts/gamejam_espaco.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/gamejam_espaco.jpg" alt="Foto que mostra o pothix programando" title="Espaço do Gamejam"></a></p>
<p>Como alguns sabem no final de semana passado ( dias 7, 8 e 9 ) eu participei do
<a href="http://itaucultural.org.br/gameplay/?s=gamejam" title="Site do GameJam">GameJam do Itaú cultural</a>.</p>
<p>Nesse evento os participantes tinham que formar equipes de até 4
pessoas e fazer um jogo em 48 horas, sendo que o tema ao qual o jogo
devia responder só seria passado na sexta feira as 19, e teríamos até
as 19 horas do domingo para entregar o jogo pronto utilizando qualquer
plataforma para desenvolvimento.</p>
<p>Pois bem, o que eu falei acima resume bem as regras do evento, agora
vamos a minha situação. Fiquei sabendo na segunda feira pelo
<a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog">CrociDB</a> que teria esse
concurso e que tinha até quarta feira para se cadastrar, e eu tinha
acabado de fazer uma mini-cirurgia para tirar um dente, portanto
estava sentindo dores e tomando 4 tipos de remédios diferentes e não
pude confirmar nada devido a esse motivo, mas a vontade era
grande. Enquanto eu não confirmava o
<a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog">CrociDB</a> ia procurando
pessoas para a equipe.</p>
<p>Quarta feira (último dia para inscrição chega) e eu já estava um
pouco melhor e decidi me inscrever! Procurei por outras pessoas para
compor a equipe, alguns descartei logo de cara por que sabia que ia
ficar arrumando desculpinha para não participar, ou não teria peito o
suficiente para aguentar a competição, então nem chamei, outros sabia
que infelizmente não poderiam participar por motivo de força maior
(fez falta hein <a href="http://rafaelmasoni.com/" title="Rafael Masoni Website">Rafael Masoni</a>)
, e teve ainda os últimos que eu achei que participariam e
fui chamar mas me decepcionaram&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="início-do-contest">Início do contest</h4>
<p>Sexta feira tudo preparado e lá vou eu as 19 para o Gamejam (que foi na faculdade
<a href="http://portal.anhembi.br/" title="Faculdade Anhembi Morumbi">Anhembi Morumbi</a>),
e após me perder um pouco ( para variar ) cheguei em cima da abertura
e recebemos o tema:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Maquinas e computadores podem tomar decisões inovadoras?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E com isso lá se vai o nosso pensamento&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Criar um robô em 2d no estilo side scroller?</li>
<li>Criar um robô fazendo algum tipo de shooter?</li>
<li>Criar um braço robô que faz algo?</li>
<li>Como ele seria inovador?</li>
<li>Ele seria inovador?</li>
<li>Como são as decisões dos computadores atualmente?</li>
</ul>
<p>E com essas várias perguntas chegamos a conclusão que um computador
sozinho não pode tomar decisões inovadoras, ele apenas é programado
para uma determinada finalidade, nunca cabe a ele as decisões finais
com novas idéias. Com isso em mente nosso game foi baseado num braço
robô que distribui caixas num armazém seguindo sua própria ordem,
supostamente tentando uma maneira inovadora de organização de cores
que pode ou não estar certa, e cabe ao jogador organizá-la da melhor
maneira possível. Obviamente a idéia inicial não se fechou tão fácil,
e fomos desenvolvendo ela de acordo com a evolução do game.</p>
<p>Com uma base inicial desenvolvida passamos para o desenvolvimento! :D</p>
<p>Preparamos o ambiente com Allegro e algumas classes que o
<a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog">CrociDB</a> usa para facilitar
algumas coisas e eu dei uma introdução sobre o workflow do Git para
trabalhar utilizando controle de versão<a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog"></a>. Usamos um roteador para conectar os 2 notebooks e
compartilhar um repositório para os códigos, por ssh mesmo, que
infelizmente deixava a transferência muito ruim devido ao uso do
Cygwin no Windows, mas não fui um grande empecilho, foi apenas chato.</p>
<p>Tenho que admitir que eu sou um zero a esquerda em Allegro e fui com a
cara e a coragem participar desse contest, mas eu sabia que isso me
traria muita experiência, por que eu sei que o
<a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog">CrociDB</a> conhece bastante de
Allegro e de desenvolvimento de games em si, e eu só comprovei isso
durante todo o contest, ele já conhecia bem o conceito de
desenvolvimento de games e tem bastante experiência com erros que
podem acontecer.</p>
<p>Ficamos programando desde as 21 mais ou menos até as 5 da manhã e
resolvemos ir para casa descansar para voltar no sábado a noite e
ficar até terminar o game. A primeira vista achei o pessoal das outras
equipes meio acuado, cada equipe isolada em suas mesas, excluindo
apenas o pessoal que já se conhecia ou que era da faculdade.</p>
<h4 id="momento-hard-work">Momento Hard work</h4>
<p><a href="/images/posts/gamejam_hard_work.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/gamejam_hard_work.jpg" alt="Foto do pothix programando, e nosso roteador do lado" title="PotHix programando"></a></p>
<p>Voltei no sábado as 19:30 para a programação e o
<a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog">CrociDB</a> já estava por lá
programando fazia alguns minutos e já tinha resolvido alguns
probleminhas. Então já começamos a programar outras funcionalidades e
fazer os desenhos para o jogo, que por sinal foi a parte mais difícil
para nós, tendo em vista que nenhum dos dois tem a arte do desenho
assim como as outras equipes tinham ( vi muitos desenhos e trabalhos
legais ). Eu assumi uma boa parte dos desenhos para deixar o
<a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog">CrociDB</a> mais focado na
programação.</p>
<p>Durante o domingo tivemos vários problemas, como o não funcionamento
do teclado do notebook do <a href="http://crocidb.com/blog/" title="CrociDB Blog">CrociDB</a>,
nos fazendo perder um tempo e ir para o laboratório usar um teclado
USB, que levou a outro #fail, por que levamos o roteador e não
prestamos atenção que a fonte não era bivolt, assim queimando a fonte
do roteador&hellip;Ou seja&hellip;Nada de Git na parte final do projeto&hellip;</p>
<p>No laboratório conseguimos finalizar o jogo e encontrar umas midis
legais até as 14:30 mais ou menos, quando preparamos as coisas para
entregar o projeto final. Ao entregar o projeto e ver a organizadora
testando percebemos que faltou uma dll para o allegro funcionar no
Windows, e tivemos que pegar o projeto de volta umas 2 vezes para
encontrar a dll certa, mas enfim funcionou. :)</p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Depois de entregar o projeto aproveitamos para fazer um Networking com
alguma das outras equipes. Durante o evento estávamos sempre vendo
algumas pequenas cenas dos outros jogos e algumas ferramentas, e uma
que chamou bastante a atenção foi da equipe que estava ao nosso lado
(<strong>Danilo</strong>, <strong>Gabriel</strong>, <strong>Theo</strong> e o <strong>Mario</strong> que eu não conheci)
que estava desenvolvendo um game totalmente em blender! (assim que
eles divulgarem o game eu posto o link aqui). O game deles ficou muito
legal e o pessoal é muito gente fina também, foi muito válido
conhecê-los! :)</p>
<p>Vi por cima mais alguns games que estavam em fase de produção ainda, e
conheci algumas outras pessoas como o <strong>Danilo Vin</strong> (só conheço ele
assim até agora&hellip;hahaha) que estava fazendo as artes do grupo dele,
muito boas por sinal, mas não vi o jogo finalizado. Revi tambem o
Speeder já tinha visto na campus party mas não tinha conversado muito.</p>
<h4 id="considerações">Considerações</h4>
<p>Finalizando, eu acho que esse contest foi muito legal,dormi apenas 40
minutos de sábado para domingo, mas foi minha primeira experiência com
competição de desenvolvimento de games, meu primeiro contato mais
próximo com Allegro, revi alguns conceitos de C++, conheci pessoas
interessantes, vi alguns jogos serem criados do zero&hellip; Mesmo se nosso
jogo não ganhar (o que é provável&hellip;.hehe) esse contest valeu muito a
pena!  O nosso game não ficou exatamente como queríamos por que além
dos problemas, não conseguimos aplicar todas as idéias que tínhamos em
apenas 48 horas.</p>
<p>Uma coisa que me deixou muito feliz foi ter conseguido fazer esse jogo
usando apenas Software Livre! Utilizamos Inkscape, Gimp, Allegro e
GNU/Linux. O Croci utilizou Windows para compilar a versão windows do
jogo, e não tivemos <strong>sequer um</strong> problema de compatibilidade entre
plataformas.</p>
<p>Para quem quiser dar uma olhada no nosso game, pode baixar ele no
GitHub (o código não está um dos melhores, mas leve em consideração
que foi um contest de 48 horas&hellip;hehe):</p>

            <description>Como mencionei no meu ultimo post eu parcicipei do GameJam do Itaú cultural e desenvolvi um jogo com Allegro. Agora com o jogo pronto estou criando arquivos executáveis para divulgar e tinha me esquecido da diferença de arquitetura no Linux, assim compilei apenas para meu Linux x64.
Quando me dei conta que não funcionou no computador do trabalho por que eu tinha um binário x64, eu tive que instalar o Allegro no computador de lá para poder fazer funcionar também em Linux x86.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Como mencionei no
<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/development/gamejam" title="Post sobre o GameJam">meu ultimo post</a>
eu parcicipei do GameJam do Itaú cultural e desenvolvi um jogo com
Allegro. Agora com o jogo pronto estou criando arquivos executáveis
para divulgar e tinha me esquecido da diferença de arquitetura no
Linux, assim compilei apenas para meu Linux x64.</p>
<p>Quando me dei conta que não funcionou no computador do trabalho por
que eu tinha um binário x64, eu tive que instalar o Allegro no
computador de lá para poder fazer funcionar também em Linux
x86. Pensei eu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Vai ser moleza, assim como foi instalar o <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/files/allegro/4.2.2/allegro-4.2.2.tar.gz/download" title="Allegro 4.2.2 download">Allegro
4.2.2</a> no notebook x64&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E lá fui eu:</p>
<pre><code>./configure
make
</code></pre>
<p>Ué&hellip;Deu um problema bizarro com o <em>FNSTSW</em> no make, então não vai ser
tão fácil assim&hellip;E lá vamos nós procurar na internet. Procurando
<a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-allegro-maintainers/2009-May/000251.html" title="Pergunta em uma lista de discussão">eu descobri</a>
que tem realmente um erro em uma parte Assembly do código do Allegro
para x86 que está errada na versão 4.2.2 que provavelmente foi
consertada nas versões futuras, mas nesse caso tive que arrumar na
mão:</p>
<p>No arquivo <code>src/i386/icpus.s</code> alterar a seguinte linha (tirar a que tem
um menos e colocar a que tem um mais):</p>
<pre><code>fninit
movl $0x5A5A, %eax
-   fnstsw %eax
+   fnstsw %ax
cmpl $0, %eax
jne is_fpu_not_found
</code></pre>
<p>E assim eu consegui compilar certinho! :D</p>
<p>Quando tentei rodar meu binário me deparei com o seguinte erro: &ldquo;error
while loading shared libraries: liballeg.so.4.2: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory&rdquo; ¬¬</p>
<p>Pesquisando na internet novamente eu descobri que estava faltando eu
adicionar o diretório <code>/usr/local/lib</code> ao meu <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>:</p>
<p>No meu .bashrc:</p>
<pre><code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
</code></pre>
<p>OU</p>
<p>Editar o meu arquivo <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> e incluir <code>/usr/local/lib</code> no
final do arquivo e depois rodar o comando <code>ldconfig</code> como root ;)</p>
<p>Com isso eu consegui finalmente compilar ojogo e fazer o meu binário
rodar o meu jogo normalmente. :)</p>
<p>Espero que seja útil para mais alguem.</p>

            <description>E lá vamos nós com mais um post (que felizmente estou conseguindo manter mensal) sobre os serviços legais que eu vi no mês passado e estou usando esse mês.
TypingWeb O TypingWeb é um serviço web que possui vários tutoriais para aprender a digitar corretamente. Eu estou treinando digitação já faz um tempo utilizando o TypeRacing e um programinha para Linux chamado gtypist que tambem é bem legal para treinar. Achei esse site fantástico, e o mais legal de tudo é que tem uma versão em português, então eu posso passar para outras pessoas (como a minha mãe por exemplo) que tambem querem aprender a digitar melhor mas não se dão bem com o inglês.</description>

que já está a tanto tempo aí, mas resolvi comentar por
que eu estou lá há mais de 1 ano e só agora comecei a utilizar de
verdade. Quando eu entrei pela primeira vez para saber como funcionava
eu fui no site e tentei ouvir várias musicas. Umas eram cortadas, as
playlist só podiam ser tocadas por usuários premium e não sei o
que&hellip;Ou seja, achei uma porcaria.  Nos ultimos dias eu conversei com
um colega meu que me disse que deixava seu player dando tracking das
musicas que ele ouvia e mandando para o last.fm, e finalmente eu
descobri a finalidade do last.fm (noob), e realmente é bem legal ter
um perfil numa rede social de musicas, onde seus amigos podem ver o
que você anda ouvindo e comparar automáticamente o perfil musical.</p>
<p>Bem, esses são os 3 serviços que eu tenho para compartilhar esse mes!
E espero que sejam úteis para vocês assim como são para mim. :)</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mais um dos livros que eu consegui terminar de ler nas férias! O livro
fala sobre performance de front end, como fazer as suas páginas
carregarem mais rapidamente e fornecer uma melhor experiência para o
usuário.</p>
<p>O livro começa explicando um pouco sobre o HTTP, seus métodos e
utilizações, e depois inicia as sobre as 14 regras para ter um website
mais performático. Eu vou tentar mostrar um pouco de cada uma das
regras que o livro aborda, mas é claro que sem os grandes detalhes,
comparações e exemplos que o livro dá, que são muito amplos e
interessantes para se entender, mas vou dar uma visão geral de qual é
o conteúdo da regra, para te chamar para comprar o livro e ler (ou
não&hellip;hehhe).</p>
<p>As 14 regras são:</p>
<h4 id="faça-menos-requisições-http">Faça menos requisições HTTP</h4>
<p>Obviamente se tivermos menos requisições HTTP teremos páginas mais
rápidas, então o livro recomenda várias técnicas legais como combinar
imagens e usar estampas CSS, combinar scripts para evitar várias
chamadas, assim chamando um script só, e tambem combinar folhas de
estilo.</p>
<h4 id="use-uma-rede-de-distribuição-de-conteúdo">Use uma Rede de Distribuição de conteúdo</h4>
<p>Distribua seu aplicativo de diferentes servers distribuídos
geograficamente, pois assim você conseguirá entrega de pacotes mais
rapidamente para determinados tipos de usuarios.</p>
<h4 id="adicione-um-cabeçalho-expires">Adicione um cabeçalho expires</h4>
<p>Sempre usar bem os cabeçalhos expires dos pacotes, para que o browser
possa controlar de maneira correta o cache. Utilizando expires para
datas futuras você cosegue um ótimo ganho de performance, por que não
vai ser necessária outra chamada HTTP, pois o browser vai saber que
seu cache não expirou e vai manter os arquivos já baixados.</p>
<p>Obviamente isso deve ser bem controlado para você saber o que deve
ficar no cache e quando substituir determinadas coisas (que podem ser
substituidas alterando o nome, por exemplo).</p>
<h4 id="componentes-gzip">Componentes gzip</h4>
<p>Sempre usar o mod de gzip (se vc estiver usando apache), pois os
ganhos são muito grandes, e chegam a mais de 50% do total de tempo
final de renderização da página.  #### Coloque as folhas de estilo no
topo Um argumento bem legal para esse! O autor do livro mostrou suas
experiências com o arquivo CSS em outros lugares que não são o topo e
percebeu que a página esperava pelo CSS para poder continuar
renderizando a página, portanto reduz a experiência do usuário, que
ficará com uma página em branco enquanto aguarda, sendo que poderia
estar vendo aos poucos a página.</p>
<p>O que faz o browser esperar que o CSS seja carregado é o fato de ele
não ter que renderizar duas vezes (uma com o css padrão do browser e
outra com o seu CSS personalizado).</p>
<h4 id="coloque-os-scripts-no-final">Coloque os scripts no final</h4>
<p>O argumento para esse é que a pagina sempre para de carregar os outros
componentes enquanto está carregando os scripts, por que eles podem
alterar a página com algum document.write, e muitas a ordem precisa
ser mantida, portanto com os scripts no final da página você vai
retardar menos o carregamento, pois quando estiver carregando o script
o usuário já vai ter uma boa parte da página para se intreter.</p>
<p>Lembrando que nem sempre é possível colocar o script no final da
página, pois as vezes os elementos precisam do script carregado para
fazer determinadas coisas, mas sempre que possível a sua performance
pode ser melhorada com os scripts no final.</p>
<h4 id="exite-expressões-css">Exite expressões CSS</h4>
<p>Todos sabemos que expressões CSS ( usando expression ) não é bom, e o
livro demonstra alguns por que&rsquo;s disso que não vou abordar, apenas
digo: Não use!</p>
<h4 id="deixe-o-javascript-e-o-css-em-arquivos-externos">Deixe o Javascript e o CSS em arquivos externos</h4>
<p>Interessante essa parte, por que como eu pensava, realmente deixar o
CSS e o Javascript embutidos na página é mais rápido, mas quando se
tem Javascript e CSS em arquivos separados e com um expires
configurado você tem uma melhor resposta por que os scripts seriam
carregados uma vez só e depois mantidos em cache enquanto várias
páginas ficariam menores para carregamento.</p>
<h4 id="reduza-as-pesquisas-em-dns">Reduza as pesquisas em DNS</h4>
<p>Nesse capítulo ele fala um pouco do tempo que demora para resolver um
DNS e que é possível fazer caches de DNS</p>
<h4 id="minimize-o-javascript">Minimize o Javascript</h4>
<p>É comentado um pouco de ofuscamento de Javascript, quando você tira
todos os espaços e caracteres inúteis do seu javascript deixando ele
funcional e mais leve. Quando se usa Gzip essa técnica ajuda pouco,
pois o texto já vai ser compactado, mas mesmo assim ainda há ganho, e
um comentário pessoal: Se você não altera esse javascript com
frequência, por que não? :)</p>
<h4 id="evite-redirecionamentos">Evite redirecionamentos</h4>
<p>Os redirecionamentos são reponsáveis por uma boa parte do tempo de uma
requisição, deixando o usuário vendo uma tela em braco nesse meio
tempo, portanto não são nada bons para um website. O livro trata de
algumas formas para evitar redirecionamentos, como alias do apache por
exemplo.</p>
<h4 id="remova-scripts-duplicados">Remova scripts duplicados</h4>
<p>Parece estranho a primeira vista mas realmente acontece dependendo do
tamanho do seu código e a quantidade de CSS e Javascript que você
possui em sua página. O autor resolveu colocar esse tópico analizando
grandes sites da internet e percebendo que vários deles possuia esse
problema, gerando requisições em vão.</p>
<h4 id="configure-as-etags">Configure as Etags</h4>
<p>Use-as ou deixe-as! As Etags podem ajudar bastante na performance se
bem configuradas e o livro dá vários exemplos de como isso pode ser
feito, alem de uma explicação legal do que são as Etags.</p>
<h4 id="faça-com-que-o-ajax-se-aproveite-do-cache">Faça com que o AJAX se aproveite do cache</h4>
<p>O livro descreve alguns exemplos onde o cache pode ser utilizado para
aplicações com AJAX (utilizando expires com data futura) e outros
onde realmente é dinâmica demais para se usar um cache. É interessante
para se descobrir maneiras diferentes de se lidar com a performance e
como ela se aplica para o seu caso.</p>
<h4 id="analizando-10-grandes-sites">Analizando 10 grandes sites</h4>
<p>Essa foi uma parte que eu gostei bastante de ler, por que ele mostra
grandes sites que estamos acostumados acessar ( os sites analisados
nesse capítulo são: Amazon, AOL, CNN, eBay, Google, MSN, MySpace,
Wikipedia, Yahoo, Youtube ) e mostra as partes boas e ruim que foram
implementadas, e assim você ve com ótimos exemplos o que poderia ser
feito, juntamente com as ferramentas utilizadas para a medição de cada
uma das funcionalidades, e você pode muito bem utilizar as mesmas
ferramentas para medir o seu website.</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>O livro é muito legal para se saber como trabalhar bem uma performance
de front para você proporcionar uma melhor experiência para o seu
usuário, deixando uma navegação mais rápida. Algumas das coisas que o
livro aborda são extremas (necessárias para grandes sites, como no
caso do autor, o Yahoo!), e muito provavelmente não são totalmente
úteis em pequenos websites, mas a grande maioria é totalmente
aplicável.</p>
<p>Eu particularmente gostei bastante do livro, mesmo ainda não
aplicacando tudo o que o livro fala, consegui ter uma boa noção de
boas práticas e experiências de alguem que já trabalhou com isso e tem
bons argumentos para lhe dizer por que isso seria uma boa escolha.</p>
<p>Eu recomendo! :)</p>

            <title>Instalando gems do GitHub manualmente</title>

            <description>Esse vai ser um post rápido para relatar um problema que eu tive ( e ainda estou tendo ) para instalar gems do GitHub.
Por algum motivo bizarro (nem tanto assim, parece ser dns, mas já tentei opendns e nada) a página http://gems.github.com não abre de maneira nenhuma, enquanto a navegação continua normal sem nenhum problema&amp;hellip; A consequência disso é que eu não consigo colocar o source do github nas minhas configurações do Rubygems.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Esse vai ser um post rápido para relatar um problema que eu tive ( e
ainda estou tendo ) para instalar gems do GitHub.</p>
<p>Por algum motivo bizarro (nem tanto assim, parece ser dns, mas já
tentei opendns e nada) a página <a href="http://gems.github.com">http://gems.github.com</a> não abre de
maneira nenhuma, enquanto a navegação continua normal sem nenhum
problema&hellip; A consequência disso é que eu não consigo colocar o source
do github nas minhas configurações do Rubygems. :(</p>
<p>Tendo em vista que eu não conseguiria utilizar gem install para
nenhuma gem que vinha do GitHub tive que dar um jeito de instalar
manualmente. :)</p>
<p>O que fiz foi acessar a página do GitHub referente a gem que eu queria
instalar, que no caso é a
<a href="http://github.com/fnando/kitabu/tree/master" title="Kitabu">kitabu</a> do
<a href="http://github.com/fnando" title="Nando Viera">fnando</a>, pegar o link de
clone e clonar:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/fnando/kitabu.git
</code></pre>
<p>Mas ae que está o lance que eu demorei para encontrar (noob), para
uma gem ser instalada localmente ela precisa estar empacotada, e no
GitHub você baixa direto o código fonte. Para empacotar:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem build kitabu.gemspec
</code></pre>
<p>Agora sim eu tenho o arquivo <code>kitabu-0.3.3.gem</code> que eu posso utilizar
para instalar localmente! Para instalar é só utilizar o gem install
padrão informando o arquivo a ser instalado:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install kitabu-0.3.3.gem
</code></pre>
<p>E pronto! Lá está a minha gem instalada!</p>
<p>Espero que isso seja útil para mais alguem que precise empacotar as
suas gems. :)</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chegou o momento que eu estava esperando há vários meses&hellip;. Após
terminar de ler, vou escrever sobre O Senhor dos Anéis! :D</p>
<p>Todos que me conhecem sabem como eu sou apaixonado pelo mundo de O
senhor dos anéis na verdade sobre histórias medievais e o Senhor dos
anéis é foda), e eu só tinha assistido o filme (mais de 10 vezes o
primeiro, e milhões de vezes os outros 2) e não tinha lido o livro
ainda, o que me deixava inquieto, pois eu sabia muito bem que o nível
de riquezas e detalhes do livro ia muito alem do que eu podia
imaginar, sem contar que muita coisa foi cortada no filme (obviamente)
para que se fosse feita uma boa adaptação.</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/lord_of_the_rings.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/lord_of_the_rings.jpg" alt="Foto do livro dO Senhor dos Anéis" title="Meu livro do senhor dos anéis"></a></p>
<p>Esse ano eu comprei a versão full do livro com os 6 livros, e não
divididos em 3 versões encadernadas, por que queria me gabar de ler um
tremendo monstro de 1200 páginas (haha), e adotei alguma disciplina
para ler, pois por que se você encarar 1200 páginas para ler como se
fosse um todo você vai procrastinar bastante. O que fiz foi dividir
por capítulos e a cada dia que se passava eu lia um capítulo.</p>
<p>Não sei quanto tempo exatamente levei para ler esse livro, mas como as
coisas foram bem planejadas, eu consigo supor que levei cerca de 62
dias (São 62 capítulos divididos entre 6 livros), o que é um tempo
razoavelmente bom para se ler um livro desse tamanho (pelo menos para
o meu ritmo).</p>
<p>O que eu falo abaixo não vai ser nenhum spoiler se você já viu o filme
e ainda não leu o livro. ;)</p>
<h4 id="primeiro-livro">Primeiro livro</h4>
<p>O primeiro livro conta desde a festa de aniversário do Bilbo até o
momento onde está fugindo dos espectros e eles foram levados pelo
rio. Entre esses dois eventos muita coisa legal acontece, e muitas
coisas que não aparecem no filme por diversos motivos, alguns por
quantidade hábil de tempo ( senão o filme seria infinito&hellip; ) e outras
por que não seria muito legal a cena em filme e apenas em livro é
legal.</p>
<p>Um personagem que era para estar na comitiva dos Hobbits mas ficou
para ajuda-los com o Nazgul foi o Fatty Bolger, que não foi mencionado
no filme mas teve a sua pequena participação como amigo dos Hobbits.</p>
<p>Uma parte legal que não foi incluída nos filmes foi a viagem pela
colina dos túmulos, onde eles encontram algumas coisas legais além de
Tom Bombadil (que não faria uma boa participação no filme devido a
característica do personagem, apesar de toda a influencia que tem na
história e por ser uma das criaturas mais velhas e misteriosas da
terra media) que os ajuda.</p>
<p>No ponei saltitante que o Sam conhece o Ponei &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; que
posteriormente é deixado em Minas Moria contra a vontade de Sam, mas
ele ainda aparece bastante na história, mas ficou meio de lado no
filme.</p>
<h4 id="segundo-livro">Segundo Livro</h4>
<p>O Segundo livro vai desde a chegada a Valfenda até o rompimento da
sociedade já com a morte de Boromir.</p>
<p>Na minha opinião a personalidade do Boromir ficou um pouco diferente
no filme, fazendo com que ele parecesse traiçoeiro todo o tempo, o que
no livro da outra impressão, que ele estava realmente indo até
Valfenda para descobrir mais sobre os sonhos que tiveram sobre o
retorno do descendente de Isildur e os pequenos.</p>
<p>As passagens por Moria com charadas para entrar, a queda de Gandalf na
luta contra o Balrog, foi como rever o filme com vários detalhes.</p>
<p>A passada por Lórien foi muito legal, e é interessante ver as pequenas
aparições do Golum em alguns lugares, e os caras tentando descobrir
que bicho era aquele que estava rastejando em tal lugar e tudo mais.</p>
<h4 id="terceiro-livro">Terceiro Livro</h4>
<p>O terceiro livro conta desde a morte de Boromir e sua partida pelo rio
até o momento que Pippin olha no &ldquo;Palantir&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gostei de ler todas as estratégias dos cavaleiros de Rohan contra os
Uruk-hai enquanto eles estavam com Pippin e Merry, até todos os
detalhes da fuga deles no meio das batalhas para a floresta de
Fangorn. Fangorn é o nome do Barbarvore, que é outro dos seres mais
velhos da terra média. Uma coisa que foi interessante, foi que os Ents
realmente decidiram ir para a guerra e marcharam para isso, não apenas
viram uma foresta devastada e foram do nada ( assim como no filme ), e
foi legal ler sobre a marcha deles. Outra coisa interessante tambem
são os momentos com Barbarvore que são muito bem descritos, tanto como
as tocas dos Ents.</p>
<p>As descrições da batalha dos ents em Isengard são ótimas! O que eles
fizeram, seus momentos de fúria contra a torre do Saruman e mais
coisas interessantes.</p>
<p>Uma cena boa de se ler é quando Gandalf (que já tinha retornado como O
branco) conversa com o Saruman após o fim da Guerra, quando Isengard
havia sido derrotada (que só tem na versão estendida do filme), onde
ele mostra que o Saruman já não tem mais cor nenhuma e que o único
poder dele era a voz e isso ainda podia persuadir muita gente.</p>
<h4 id="quarto-livro">Quarto Livro</h4>
<p>O quarto livro conta a parte da viagem que fala sobre Frodo e Sam,
desde o momento que eles prendem o Golum e ele jura guia-los, até o
momento que Sam acha que Frodo estar morto após ser atingido pela
ferroada da Laracna.</p>
<p>No livro é ainda mais claro como o Sam odeia o Golum e sabe que será
traído a qualquer momento, enquanto o Frodo ainda acredita nele ( seja
por que achq eu ele vai melhorar ou por que não tem outra escolha ).</p>
<p>Aqui que o Faramir aparece pela primeira vez perguntando pelo Boromir,
e é aqui que ele quase mata o Golum por estar no lago proibido. As
descrições do Tolkien sobre os lugares, paisagens e detalhes de
personagens são fantásticas, e você consegue criar mentalmente todo o
cenário.</p>
<h4 id="quinto-livro">Quinto Livro</h4>
<p>O quinto livro vai desde a chegada de Gandalf a Minas Tirith junto com
Pippin até o fim da guerra de Gondor e a concentração em frente ao
portão negro.</p>
<p>Gostei bastante desse livro por que detalha bastante a concentração
das tropas, os ataques, o medo das pessoas que estão na cidade, e a
espectativa pré-guerra.</p>
<p>Uma das coisas que eu estava esperando ver e não aconteceu exatamente
como eu esperava, era a guerra no Pellenor com o auxílio dos mortos
que vieram das sendas dos mortos. Na história original eles ajudaram a
tomar todos os navios que estavam indo para Gondor, mas não foram além
para ajudar na batalha ( assim como aconteceu no filme ), e foram
dispensados antes, portanto, na batalha em Gondor eles tiveram que
vencer com homens que conseguiram no caminho com os navios e os que já
estavam lá.</p>
<p>A morte de Théoden juntamente com o grande feito de Éowyn ( com a
ajuda do Merry ) ao matar o senhor dos Nazgûl justamente quando eles
tinham acabado de derrubar o portão e ele estava pronto para adentrar
na cidade foi muito bom! Vendo as descrições das batalhas achei as
cenas dos filmes mais fantásticas do que eu achava antes.</p>
<h4 id="sexto-livro">Sexto Livro</h4>
<p>O ultimo livro começa com Sam indo ao resgate de Frodo que foi levado
pelos Orcs até Cirith Ungol e termina com o final das guerras, da
terceira era e da influência dos anéis na terra média.</p>
<p>Os detalhes das torres e das brigas dos Orcs em Cirith Ungol é muito
interessante e você sente o quanto o Sam estaria desesperado por estar
dentro da fortaleza do Inimigo numa missão praticamente suicida, mas
por sorte os orcs se mataram antes dele chegar&hellip;hehe</p>
<p>O que gostei mais foi o final que não é totalmente clarificado no
filme, e no livro tenho todos os detalhes e o ponto final. A parte
final onde se vê todos se despedindo saindo de Gondor e passando por
todos os lugares que passaram, deixando cada povo em sua determinada
terra, sem contar com alguns que se juntaram para fazer coisas
diferentes é interessante como lembrança de toda a história.</p>
<p>Agora pude ler todos os detalhes do casamento do Faramir com a
Éowyn. Ela é um dos personagens mais interessantes, por que é uma
mulher que não quer ser rainha nem donzela, e sim um cavaleiro e lutar
até a morte, e o Faramir usou ótimos argumentos para domar a
fera&hellip;hehe</p>
<p>A parte de expurgo do condado que eu estava curioso para ler havia
muito tempo, e não sabia que o Saruman ia aprontar antes de morrer
ainda.</p>
<h4 id="apêndices">Apêndices</h4>
<p>Estou começando a ler os Apêndices agora e eles com certeza serão a
minha introdução para o Silmarilion, por que falam muitas coisas que a
história conta, e agora entendo o por que de cada
acontecimento. Enquanto ele vai descrevendo cada acontecimento ele
manda as referências em páginas, tanto nessa obra como em outras como
O Hobbit (que eu também tenho), e por isso eu quero degustar aos
poucos essa leitura vendo todas as referências e ligando os fatos
entre as histórias. :D</p>
<p>Eu recomendo bastante você a ler os Apêndices se você quiser entender
que O senhor dos anéis é só a ponta do Iceberg num mundo maravilhoso
que o criou.</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>O que eu queria fazer é descrever um pouco que eu gostei mesmo de ler,
e como não fui anotando nada e deixei para fazer tudo no final, e não
lembro de muitas coisas que eu queria escrever aqui, mas acho que
consegui escrever alguns dos pontos legais que não tem só no filme.</p>
<p>Só para constar, eu acho o filme fantástico e na minha opinião é uma
das melhores adaptações de livros ever! As coisas que eu comento aqui
não tiram nem um pouco os méritos do filme, apenas mostram que um
livro de 1200 páginas pode ser muito mais bem detalhados do que 9
horas (ou 11 no estendido) de filme.</p>
<p>Acho que consegui descrever sem dar grandes spoilers para quem nunca
leu, e recomendo muito mesmo que você leia, por que vale muito a pena!</p>

            <description>Aqui estou eu com mais um GameReview de um jogo que eu tenho jogado ultimamente no PSP e finalmente no sábado as 02:15 eu consegui terminar, o Spiderman - Friend or foe!
Como quem já me conhece sabe, eu sou um fã de homem aranha! Não aquele fã que tem todos os quadrinhos ou que fica comprando um monte de coisas, mas eu sempre gostei das histórias do aranha e sempre que possível comprava ou pegava emprestado algumas séries de quadrinhos para ler, ou jogos para jogar, ou desenhos/filmes para assistir, enfim&amp;hellip; Homem Aranha FTW!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aqui estou eu com mais um GameReview de um jogo que eu tenho jogado
ultimamente no PSP e finalmente no sábado as 02:15
<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/moto_0690.jpg" title="Tela de créditos do Jogo">eu consegui terminar</a>,
o Spiderman - Friend or foe!</p>
<p>Como quem já me conhece sabe, eu sou um fã de homem aranha! Não aquele
fã que tem todos os quadrinhos ou que fica comprando um monte de
coisas, mas eu sempre gostei das histórias do aranha e sempre que
possível comprava ou pegava emprestado algumas séries de quadrinhos
para ler, ou jogos para jogar, ou desenhos/filmes para assistir,
enfim&hellip; Homem Aranha FTW! :D</p>
<p>Agora vamos ao game:</p>
<h4 id="história">História</h4>
<p>A história do jogo é bem legal e foi uma das coisas que mais me
motivou a jogar. Você é convocado por ninguém mais ninguém menos que
Nick Fury ( da S.H.I.E.L.D,
<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/moto_0692.jpg" title="Nick Fury no menu do SpiderMan - Friend or Foe">veja ele no menu do jogo</a>)
para descobrir e eliminar uma espécie alienígena de simbionte parecido
com o que é o Venom. Até aí tudo bem, pois seria apenas mais um enredo
do Aranha com simbiotes, mas o mais legal disso é que os simbiotes se
apossam dos inimigos do aranha, fazendo com que você tenha que
enfrentar seus velhos inimigos que estão possuídos por um &ldquo;amuleto
místico&rdquo; alienígena e libertá-los do controle requisitando a ajuda
deles para acabar com os simbiotes que os possuíram.</p>
<h4 id="jogabilidade">Jogabilidade</h4>
<p>A jogabilidade não é tão boa quanto eu pensava, e dá a impressão que o
jogo não foi tão bem programado quanto deveria.</p>
<p>Durante o jogo você encontra alguns barris para quebrar e conseguir
Tokens para comprar novos golpes e tal, mas você só pode quebrar um
por vez com socos ( a não ser que você use um Stomp, que só o do Venom
é legal&hellip; ), e os socos são estranhos para acertar&hellip;Sem contar que
os combos não são muito claros para sair também, tem horas que vale
mais a pena você ficar alternando entre dois botões do que tentar um
combo específico.</p>
<h4 id="dificuldade">Dificuldade</h4>
<p>Achei o jogo muito fácil. Você tem dois personagens para controlar e não há limites de vidas, você pode morrer infinitas vezes desde que haja um personagem vivo no tempo que o outro está morto, e isso torna as coisas muito fáceis por que você pode simplesmente ficar correndo ou usando os &ldquo;especiais&rdquo; de defesa enquanto o outro personagem não retorna. Me lembro de ter perdido os 2 personagens apenas uma vez no jogo por bobeira minha.</p>
<h4 id="pontos-fortes">Pontos Fortes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eu gostei bastante da história e dos vídeos tanto explicativos para a missão como os vídeos pós-missão também. Os vídeos são engraçados e explicam bastante sobre a missão, e tem bem a cara do homem aranha mesmo, olhando para o Misterio e perguntando se ele tem um peixe na cabeça, ou falando que não quer que o Venom ajude&hellip;hehehe</li>
<li>Os mini-games são legais</li>
<li>A espectativa de qual será o próximo personagem que você vai liberar para jogar</li>
<li>Suposto final alternativo que eu ainda não vi e acho que vou ter que terminar denovo para saber&hellip;hehe</li>
<li>Vários extras diferentes para liberar</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pontos-fracos">Pontos Fracos</h4>
<ul>
<li>Definitivamente não gosto de jogos que tem paredes invisíveis no cenário, acho que quando não tem nada para aquele lado não deve haver um espaço para se andar</li>
<li>Alguns problemas de colisão chatos acontecem de vez em quando, como você ficar em frente a porta quando ela vai abrir e ela te atravessar</li>
<li>Toda vez que você vai encontrar inimigos tem uma cena que mostra os inimigos aparecendo e tal, mas se você estivesse quebrando um barril do outro lado do cenário e os inimigos aparecerem você será &ldquo;tele-transportado&rdquo; para um local padrão no cenário para esperar os inimigos.</li>
<li>As missões se tornam um pouco cansativas por ser sempre do mesmo jeito, você encontra sempre os mesmos inimigos, alterando pouca coisa nas cores e alguns golpes e sempre as mesmas quantidades com a mesma intro.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concluindo, para quem realmente gosta das histórias do Aranha ( assim
como eu ) provavelmente vai gostar do jogo, mas se você nem gosta
muito do aranha acho que você vai achar o jogo cansativo e não vai
conseguir ir até o final.</p>
<p>No fim das contas&hellip;.Eu gostei! :)</p>

            <description>Nesse sábado aconteceu o quinto encontro do Guru-sp! :)
O encontro estava marcado para as 10 da manhã com uma seção para iniciantes e começou as 10:30 ( sempre atrasa um pouquinho né? hehe ), já com um bate papo legal coordenado pelo @rafaelrosafu após uma breve apresentação de todos os participantes.
Rails para iniciantes Nessa primeira seção tiveram muitas conversas interessantes sobre algumas filosofias Rails, como:
 DRY REST TDD Test all the Fucking Time Skynny Controllers and Fat Models  e mais algumas outras coisas bem interessantes que fomentaram uma ótima discussão sobre quais os melhores padrões para se seguir quando se constrói uma aplicação Rails (sim, falamos tomando como base uma aplicação Rails), como utilizar plugins como o ResourceController (que tem seus prós e contras), manter seus scripts num lugar diferente da pasta scripts, que é a pasta padrão para scripts &amp;ldquo;internos&amp;rdquo; do Rails e tentar centralizar em uma pasta dentro de lib, além de usar Rake sempre que possível para essas tarefas ficarem organizadas e de fácil acesso.</description>

<p>Uma parada rápida para o almoço no Shopping e lá se vão mais de 20
programadores para comer a bater papo! :)</p>
<h4 id="datamapper">DataMapper</h4>
<p>Após o almoço tivemos a palestra sobre
<a href="http://datamapper.org/doku.php" title="DataMapper">DataMapper</a> do
<a href="http://www.rafaelrosafu.com" title="Rafael Rosa">@rafaelrosafu</a> (olha ele
aí novamente!) que explicou muito bem dando várias referências sobre
o seu blog pessoal e como ele fez para utilizar o DataMapper ao invés
do Active Record. O Rails é mais difícil de se sair do padrão, mas
ficará mais simples de se escolher um ORM quando chegarmos ao Rails
3. Aproveitando o gancho de DataMapper eu falei um pouco de Sinatra
dando alguns pitacos na condução do Rafael.</p>
<h4 id="git">Git</h4>
<p>Após a palestra de DataMapper passamos para uma palestra de Git com o
Douglas (qmx), que foi muito interessante e participativa! Pegamos
uma galera do grupo para fazer um scaffold e commitar no projeto para
começar a ver coisas diferentes, como merges, rebases, mudanças de
commit, e algumas outras coisas legais, como usar tags, procurar por
um código em meio aos commits e outras coisas interessantes! =)</p>
<p>Levantamos a idéia de participar do Rails Rumble, aproveitando que o
Diego Carrion estava conosco e comentou que a GoNow estava
patrocinando 3 equipes para o evento, mas não conseguimos ter uma
idéia legal para propor para o concurso.</p>
<h4 id="coding-dojo">Coding Dojo</h4>

<p>E finalmente como ultima coisa do dia tivemos o nosso coding dojo, que
era uma das coisas que eu mais estava esperando nesse econtro! O
Vinicius Baggio &ldquo;se ofereceu&rdquo; (com um empurrãozinho meu&hellip;hahah)
para ficar com o notebook ligado no datashow e conduzir o código. O
dojo foi muito divertido com participação de todos da sala, o que
sempre trazia novas idéias para fazer um código melhor e agregava
conhecimento para todos. Fizemos TDD para construir umas classes
simples de usuário. :)</p>
<h4 id="conclusão">Conclusão</h4>
<p>Gostaria de agradecer ao André e o pessoal da Voice Technology por
todo o apoio ao evento e ao grupo, com local, organização, fotos e
mais várias outras coisas! Guys you Rock! :D</p>
<p>Infelizmente algumas pessoas não puderam aparecer, e outras apareceram
por pouco tempo (o Marcelo Castellani), por motivos pessoais, mas
espero que estejam presentes no próximo! :)</p>
<p>O evento realmente valeu a pena e aprendi muita coisa por lá, alem de
conhecer muita gente interessante tambem! Agora é marcar os próximos e
esperar que o grupo cada vez cresça mais e podemos fortalecer as
amizades e conhecimentos!</p>

            <description>Pois é&amp;hellip; Sei que muitos de vocês devem estar pensando se esse era um review de algum demo do Diablo III que sabe se lá como eu teria conseguido por que ainda nem lançou, mas não, esse é um review do Diablo I! Estranho como um jogo lançado a tantos anos atrás tenha ganhado um review meu agora, não? :P
Quando o Diablo I foi lançado eu mal sabia o que era ter um computador, e a única coisa que eu podia fazer era ver um colega meu com o jogo original jogando enquanto eu ficava babando&amp;hellip;.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pois é&hellip; Sei que muitos de vocês devem estar pensando se esse era um
review de algum demo do Diablo III que sabe se lá como eu teria
conseguido por que ainda nem lançou, mas não, esse é um review do
Diablo I! Estranho como um jogo lançado a tantos anos atrás tenha
ganhado um review meu agora, não? :P</p>
<p>Quando o Diablo I foi lançado eu mal sabia o que era ter um
computador, e a única coisa que eu podia fazer era ver um colega meu
com o jogo original jogando enquanto eu ficava
babando&hellip;.hahaha&hellip;Pois é, e os tempos passaram, eu comprei meu
Playstation e comecei a jogar Diablo ( um port da Brasoft para o
Diablo do computador, que ficou bem razoável diga-se de passagem ),
mas ocupava muitos blocos do Memory card se salvar o progresso no jogo
e salvar só o personagem e ir passando toda a história toda vez era
muito chato, então não joguei muito apesar de achar muito legal.</p>
<p>Quando já tinha meu computador comecei a jogar Diablo II que por sinal
é muito legal, mas não é o tema desse review, e talvez algum dia tenha
o seu, mas eu não cheguei a terminá-lo. O mais interessante é que eu
não conhecia o suficiente da história do Diablo para entender algumas
coisas.</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/diablo_start.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/diablo_start.jpg" alt="Foto de um PSP com a tela de abertura do Diablo" title="Diablo no PSP"></a></p>
<p>Pois bem, agora com o PSP, recebo a notícia do meu colega que ele
estava conseguindo rodar aquele diablo do Playstation no PSP, e foi só
o que faltava para despertar a minha vontade de voltar a jogar esse
jogo! :)</p>
<p>Dessa vez resolvi adentrar realmente na história do jogo, portanto
comecei a ler toda a história em alguns sites e entender toda a trama
do jogo (o que por sua vez me fez entender toda a trama do segundo
tambem :D).</p>
<p>Tinha escrito um resumo da história do jogo, mas resolvi não deixar
aqui para que vocês vejam a história completa, por que eu não vou
conseguir dar todos os maravilhosos detalhes da trama aqui. Veja a
<a href="http://us.battle.net/d3/pt/forum/topic/3280530454" title="História do Diablo">história do Diablo aqui</a> (realmente vale a pena).</p>
<p>O jogo em si é muito legal para quem gosta do bom e velho RPG. :)</p>
<p>Você pode escolher entre 3 personagens: O guerreiro tem mais força
inicialmente e pode brandir machados e espadas mais facilmente, a
&ldquo;Arqueira&rdquo; (não sei como chamá-la) tem mais abilidade com armas de
longa distancia, e o mago vem com um nível de magia maior para você
utilizar mais cajado e magias.</p>
<p>A diferença nos personagens é apenas inicial, você pode muito bem
pegar um mago e aumentar apenas a força dele para que ele possa
brandir armas maiores, só vai demorar um pouco mais, assim como o
guerreiro pode muito bem aprender magias.</p>
<p>O jogo é grandioso para a época, e se passa num cenário fechado
dividido por 16 ou 17 níveis, onde você desce por catacumbas
enfrentando criaturas infernais e personagens que tem história
própria, que só quando você conhece a história do jogo você percebe
como a trama foi bem criada.</p>
<p>O objetivo do jogo é claro, você tem que matar o Diablo que se soltou
da velha pedra que o aprisionava e agora se apossou do corpo do filho
do rei Leoric. Ele se encontra no ultimo andar das catacumbas, e para
chegar lá você se encontra com muitos passos da história e vai
encontrando vários livros que vão lhe mostrando partes interessantes
sobre a sua missão.</p>
<p>O jogo no PSP (que é o mesmo do Playstation) não é tão rico quanto o
do computador que tem muitas coisas bem legais, mas é bem jogável e a
jogabilidade ficou bem legal levando em consideração as limitações que
eles tiveram que encontrar para migrar um jogo de PC que era
controlado por um mouse e tinha diversas teclas para facilitar para um
controle com pouquísimos botões.</p>
<p>Não encontrei bugs (sei que existe um &ldquo;truquezinho&rdquo; para duplicar
items e ouro, mas isso não é beeeem um bug :P), e apenas me deparei
com alguns momentos de slow down no PSP quando a quantidade de
inimigos é muito grande, mas nada que vá atralhar muito a
jogabilidade.</p>
<p>Concluindo, se você está em 2009 (assim como eu estou agora quando
estou escrevendo esse post) e ainda não jogou Diablo I aproveite e
jogue! Leia a história do jogo e comece a jogar que você vai entender
cada parte do jogo e vai ver como a história é bem ligada, e os
personagens que já participaram ainda tem seu papel no meio do jogo,
ele lhe dará uma boa introdução para que você se prepare para o Diablo
III que vai ser lançado em breve pela Blizzard! o/</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/diablo_end.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/diablo_end.jpg" alt="Foto de um PSP com a tela de final do Diablo" title="Fim do diablo no PSP"></a></p>
<p>E para finalizar esse post com chave de ouro deixo o meu momento de
triunfo ao terminar o jogo, onde ele fala que por enquanto o Diablo
está contido, mas você não sabe até quanto poderá conter toda essa
maldade com você&hellip;.</p>
<p>E agora&hellip;.Diablo II mostra sua nova aventura! ;)</p>

            <title>BookReview: Pragmatic version control using Git</title>

            <description>Há tempos que eu estava querendo conhecer um pouco mais do Git e nos últimos dias estava procurando um livro legal, quando me deparei com esse livro. Fiz algumas perguntas para um pessoal no Twitter como pessoalmente sobre esse livro, alguns me recomendavam, outros me passavam outros também interessantes, e estava em dúvida entre comprar ou não, até que consegui emprestado e li em 3 dias.
O livro é bem interessante, aborda desde o mais básico até o nível intermediário, não abordando conteúdos tão avançados.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Há tempos que eu estava querendo conhecer um pouco mais do Git e nos
últimos dias estava procurando um livro legal, quando me deparei com
esse livro. Fiz algumas perguntas para um pessoal no Twitter como
pessoalmente sobre esse livro, alguns me recomendavam, outros me
passavam outros também interessantes, e estava em dúvida entre comprar
ou não, até que consegui emprestado e li em 3 dias.</p>
<p>O livro é bem interessante, aborda desde o mais básico até o nível
intermediário, não abordando conteúdos tão avançados.</p>
<p>Começa abordando como é o fluxo de trabalho do git, mostrando com
exemplos práticos como você faz para usar o git num projeto,
modificando o arquivo, adicionando para o stage, fazendo commits e
etc. E fica uma boa parte do livro mostrando um pouco sobre as formas
com que você pode fazer as coisas, como:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adicionar arquivos como o <code>git add -i</code> para adicionar interativamente</li>
<li>Usar git log -p para alem de ver as mensagens de commit ver tambem o que foi usado</li>
<li><code>git log -2</code> para ver apenas as 2 ultimas mensagens de log</li>
<li><code>git diff --cached</code> para fazer o diff do que já está no stage</li>
<li>E mais várias outras dicas úteis</li>
</ul>
<p>Uma das coisas que eu achei interessante foi a apresentação de
curiosidades interessantes como dizer que o Git usa um hash SHA1 que
tem uma chance se se repetir de 2⁶⁹ :P.</p>
<p>Comentou sobre algumas ferramentas para se usar junto com o Git, como
alguns mergetools para facilitar no processo de merge e o git gui (
que é feio que dói, mas funciona ) para quem gosta de brincar com algo
no estilo tortoise.</p>
<p>Depois de explicar sobre a parte básica do Git ele começa a passar
para algo mais intermediário, onde vem os merges e as modificações de
commits localmente.</p>
<p>Nessa parte mais intermediária foi comentado sobre o <code>git rebase</code> e
como você pode usá-lo para reorganizar os seus ultimos commits usando
<code>git rebase -i</code>. É uma técnica bem interessante quando se faz um
monte de commits locais mas quer enviar apenas um commit para o
repositório.</p>
<p>Foi comentado tambem sobre tags e como é útil utilizá-las para marcar
as versões do seu sistema, sendo que você pode adicionar commits
apenas a uma tag e tal. Utilizando <code>git tag 1.0</code> você já define que
determinado commit marca a versão 1.0 do seu sistema. Você pode depois
dar um git checkout na sua tag e ver ela como read-only (sendo
possível criar um branch e fazer modificações).</p>
<p>Mais modos do git log foram apresentados tambem, como fazer um
<code>git log</code> para ver os commits das ultimas 5 horas, ou desde as 10 horas
usando <code>--since</code> ou <code>--before</code>, ou até mesmo usar um
<code>--pretty=format:&quot;&quot;</code> e passar uma melhor maneira para formatar o seu
log. :)</p>
<p>Conheci algums comandos interessantes que raramente são usados mas são muito úteis tambem:</p>
<ul>
<li>O <code>git gc</code> que compacta o seu repositório para que ele exclua tudo o que não está relacionado a nada, assim reduzindo o espaço que seu repositório ocupa.</li>
<li>O <code>git archive</code> para você gerar um arquivo com seu repositório com a versão que quiser, sendo tag, passando o Head ou o que achar melhor.</li>
<li>O <code>git reflog</code> para quando você precisa recuperar algum commit que não está mais no repositório, algo que estava em um branch que foi excluído ou coisas do gênero ( lembrando que se você usou o git gc isso não será possível )</li>
</ul>
<p>O livro tambem comenta de vários outros comandos, como o git
cherry-pick por exemplo, para você passar um commit para outro branch,
e sem contar que mostra várias opções que os comandos normais tem,
como o git diff para você ver os status a partir de uma tag e tal.</p>
<p>Concluindo, achei o livro interessante e recomendaria para muita
gente! O que eu tenho a dizer é que ele não é um livro para alguem que
quer ver algo avançado em git, e sim alguem que não conhece ou sabe
apenas o bem básico, pois assim vai conhecer algumas coisas bem
legais.</p>

            <title>Como desabilitar o beep no Ubuntu</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/ubuntu-beep/</link>

            <guid>https://pothix.com/posts/ubuntu-beep/</guid>
            <description>Resolvi postar sobre isso por que é uma coisa tão simples mas irrita muito quando você não sabe como desabilitar, e sempre que eu procurava eu caia em fóruns com vários comandos bizarros e colocar algo referente ao com no blacklist e não sei o que mais lá que era chato de se fazer, quando é tão fácil.
O que sempre acontecia é que eu estava aqui ouvindo boa musica (e alta, por sinal) e programando, o que me levava ao terminal em vários momentos, e quando eu menos espero aquele meu backspace adicional gera um beep monstruoso que dá um grande susto, e isso me irritava profundamente.</description>

muito quando você não sabe como desabilitar, e sempre que eu procurava

<p>O que sempre acontecia é que eu estava aqui ouvindo boa musica (e
alta, por sinal) e programando, o que me levava ao terminal em
vários momentos, e quando eu menos espero aquele meu backspace
adicional gera um beep monstruoso que dá um grande susto, e isso me
irritava profundamente.</p>
<p>O caso acima é o caso primário de beep, quando o mesmo é vindo das
caixinhas de som, e pode ser desabilitado no mesmo local que o caso
secundário.</p>
<p>O caso secundário é quando o beep chato vem do seu speaker, portanto
mesmo abaixando o som da caixinha você ainda tem o maldito beep lá no
speaker.</p>
<p>Pois bem, ambos os beeps podem ser desabilitados aqui:</p>
<p><strong>System &gt; Preferences &gt; Sound</strong></p>
<p>Todas as opções referente aos sons emitidos pelo sistema operacional
ficam aí e você pode desabilitar só alguns ou todos (como é o meu
caso). E para o beep do speaker é só desmarcar a caixa System Beep!
:)</p>
<p>Espero que mais ninguém fique desgraçando o sistema por que ele fica
emitindo beeps supostamente benéficos para vc! :P</p>

            <description>Esse mês eu estou conseguindo novamente fazer um post sobre os serviços legais que eu encontrei esse mês ( e alguns que eu já uso faz tempo )
Wakoopa O Wakoopa é um software que você instala em seu computador e ele lhe dá estatísticas do que você mais usa, entre aplicações desktop e webapps! Mas isso não é o melhor disso tudo! O melhor é que ele se integra com uma conta que você tem no site do Wakoopa e se torna uma rede social onde você pode ver o que seus amigos estão usando, fazer reviews de softwares que você gosta, encontrar softwares novos e outras coisas bem legais!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Esse mês eu estou conseguindo novamente fazer um post sobre os
serviços legais que eu encontrei esse mês ( e alguns que eu já uso faz
tempo )</p>
<h4 id="wakoopa">Wakoopa</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://wakoopa.com/pothix" title="Wakoopa">Wakoopa</a> é um software que
você instala em seu computador e ele lhe dá estatísticas do que você
mais usa, entre aplicações desktop e webapps! Mas isso não é o melhor
disso tudo! O melhor é que ele se integra com uma conta que você tem
no site do Wakoopa e se torna uma rede social onde você pode ver o que
seus amigos estão usando, fazer reviews de softwares que você gosta,
encontrar softwares novos e outras coisas bem legais! :)</p>
<h4 id="crunch-base">Crunch Base</h4>
<p>Resolvi mencionar o <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/">Chunch Base</a> após
descobrir que ele é a base que o Wakoopa consulta para saber o que é e
o que não é uma web application. A idéia do CrunchDB é que o conteúdo
é colaborativo, mas é moderado, e assim muitas aplicações podem
realmente confiar que a base deles é valida. Achei bem interessante o
projeto e resolvi até adicionar a
<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ikwa-orientao-profissional" title="Ikwa Orientação Profissional">empresa que eu trabalho atualmente</a>.</p>
<h4 id="type-racer">Type Racer</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://play.typeracer.com" title="Type Racer">Type Racer</a> é uma web app
para criar competições de digitação, e tem me ajudado bastante a
melhorar a minha e aprender a digitar melhor e mais rápido do que eu
digitava antes. Não precisa ser cadastrado para tentar, mas quando se
é cadastrado você tem gráficos nos textos que vc já digitou para saber
o quanto progrediu desde que começou a treinar, e ainda uma média de
palavras por segundo. Eu realmente recomendo!</p>
<h4 id="queen-alice">Queen Alice</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://queenalice.com" title="Queen Alice">Queen Alice</a> é uma nova versão
daquilo que chamavam de &ldquo;Xadrez Postal&rdquo;, que era quando duas pessoas
montavam dois tabuleiros, cada um em sua casa, e sempre que um fazia
uma jogada ele escrevia numa carta e enviava de volta para seu
adversário, assim quando o mesmo recebia ele fazia sua jogada e o
processo se repetia até o final do jogo. Um jogo poderia demorar anos!
O Queen Alice faz uma coisa parecida mas usando e-mail, com tempos
determinados, portanto você começa um jogo com um amigo já acordando o
tempo (1, 3, ou 7 dias jogada) com várias opções legais, e sempre
que seu adversário faz uma jogada lá você recebe um e-mail dizendo que
é sua vez e vc tem um determinado tempo para jogar senão o adversário
pode reivindicar a partida. Tem muitas opções legais e vale a pena
para quem gosta de xadrez mas não tem muito tempo para treinar.</p>
<p>É isso ae! Quem sabe no mês que vem eu consiga trazer mais serviços
web interessantes! ;)</p>

            <description>Hoje é o dia em que o pessoal da Opera falou que iria reinventar a web, e o que eles fizeram foi lancar o Opera Unite!
A idéia do Opera Unite é tornar a internet mais interligada, fazendo com que você consiga compartilhar arquivos, conversar com amigos e outras coisas apenas usando o browser.
Eu nunca utilizei Opera ( não por que eu sou contra, e sim por que eu nunca precisei e sempre estive confortável com o Firefox, principalmente para desenvolver ), mas achei interessante a campanha de marketing e a idéia deles com esse novo produto.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hoje é o dia em que o pessoal da Opera falou que iria reinventar a

Unite</a>!</p>
<p>A idéia do Opera Unite é tornar a internet mais interligada, fazendo
com que você consiga compartilhar arquivos, conversar com amigos e
outras coisas apenas usando o browser.</p>
<p>Eu nunca utilizei Opera ( não por que eu sou contra, e sim por que eu
nunca precisei e sempre estive confortável com o Firefox,
principalmente para desenvolver ), mas achei interessante a campanha
de marketing e a idéia deles com esse novo produto. Muitos disseram
que isso não era reinventar a web ( realmente fo um pouco de exagero
de marketing&hellip;hehe ), mas eu acho que isso pode revolucionar muita
coisa, só pela nova idéia mesmo! Quem sabe daqui a pouco tempo
tenhamos nossos browsers participando bem mais da web.</p>
<h4 id="o-que-o-opera-unite-traz">O que o Opera Unite traz</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fridge</strong> - Adicionar notas no estilo Post Its</li>
<li><strong>Media player</strong> - Para compartilhar suas musicas, você apenas ativa ele no Opera e ele abre uma página compartilhada onde você pode apenas clicar e ouvir! =)</li>
<li><strong>Web Server</strong> - Para compartilhar páginas HTML! É possível criar um index.html e compartilhar ele, assim você terá uma página sendo que seu computador será a hospedagem.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Sharing</strong> - Para compartilhar os seus albuns de foto.</li>
<li><strong>The Lounge</strong> - Ferramenta para hosting de um chat, bem interessante por sinal.</li>
<li><strong>File Sharing</strong> - Para compartilhamento de arquivos ( obviamente )</li>
</ul>
<p>Todos os serviços são protegidos por senha assim que são
disponibilizados para manter a sua privacidade, mas você pode deixar
publico se quiser. Os serviços tambem vem desabilitados por default
quando você instala o Opera, mas é facil habilitar:</p>
<p>Após instalar o Opera você verá no canto inferior esquerdo um ícone
parecido com um ventilador, após clicar nele você verá um assistente
para criar uma conta no Opera.com e habilitar os serviços no Unite ( é
simples ).</p>
<h4 id="considerações-finais">Considerações finais</h4>
<p>Eu gostei bastante da ideia do pessoal do Opera, e acho que traz
bastante interatividade para a internet. Talvez aqui no Brasil ainda
não seja uma realidade um compartilhamento entre computadores bom
usando a internet devido as nossas conexões, que na maioria das vezes
não é rápida o suficiente para dar uma boa impressão para o serviço.</p>
<p>Parabéns a equipe do Opera pela inovação! :)</p>

            <description>Após receber um modem Claro da empresa que eu trabalho atualmente eu fui fazer o processo de instalação no Ubuntu. Já tinha recebido a informação de um colega de trabalho de como fazer, e obviamente não foi nada difícil (o que que é difícil no Ubuntu? :)).
Vou descrever aqui o processo:
 Inserir o modem na entrada USB Vai aparecer um assistente de configuração simples ( Next Next Finish ), para você seguir e instalar.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Após receber um modem Claro da <a href="http://www.ikwa.com.br" title="Ikwa Orientação Profissional">empresa que eu trabalho atualmente</a>
eu fui fazer o processo de instalação no Ubuntu. Já tinha recebido a
informação de um <a href="http://github.com/mateuslinhares">colega de trabalho</a>
de como fazer, e obviamente não foi nada difícil (o que que é difícil
no Ubuntu? :)).</p>
<p>Vou descrever aqui o processo:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inserir o modem na entrada USB</li>
<li>Vai aparecer um assistente de configuração simples ( Next Next Finish ), para você seguir e instalar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Caso o assistente não apareça automáticamente (foi o meu caso), você
pode acessá-lo clicando com o botão direito em cima do ícone de rede
que fica ao lado do relógio e clicar em &ldquo;Edit Connections&rdquo; ou apertar
Alt+F2 (ou o seu atalho para executar) e digitar nm-connection-editor.</p>
<p>Estando no editor de conexões basta clicar na aba &ldquo;Mobile Broadband&rdquo; e
depois clicar em &ldquo;Add&rdquo;, que o assistente vai aparecer.</p>
<p>Quando terminar o processo com o assistente ( rapidinho ) o seu modem
já estará instalado! :D</p>
<p>Para sua internet funcionar você só vai precisar mudar os endereços de
DNS que não estarão corretos. Para alterar apenas clique em na conexão
que você criou no &ldquo;Edit Connections &gt; Mobile Broadband&rdquo;, e clique
em &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Após clicar em &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; digite a senha do seu usuário (se necessário)
e siga para a aba IPV4 Settings. Nessa aba altere o campo DNS Settings
para <strong>208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220</strong>.</p>
<p>Com isso você já vai conseguir navegar normalmente! :)</p>

            <description>Depois de conhecer alguns serviços legais na internet resolvi postar sobre eles aqui. Gostaria de fazer um post desse tipo mensalmente ( assim como o Ronaldo Ferraz faz no seu blog sobre o balanço cultural, que eu acho bem legal ), mas pelo menos dessa vez quero postar algumas coisas legais, e se possível eu posto periódicamente o que eu tenho feito / encontrado de divertido. ;)

<h4 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h4>
<p>Já começando com o <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com">DropBox</a>, que é
uma aplicação para sincronização de arquivos. Ele funciona da seguinte
maneira:</p>
<p>Você instala o software do dropbox (que tem para várias plataformas!
), e cria uma conta no site, com isso eles disponibilizam um
armazenamento de 2GB gratuitamente para seus arquivos (e mais no
máximo 3 GB se você recomendar alguem, portanto se for criar me peçam
um convite please).</p>
<p>Com o Dropbox você pode criar pastas compartilhadas com seus amigos
que tambem possuem dropbox, assim compartilhando arquivos facilmente,
só colocar ele na pasta que o dropbox vai fazer o upload
automáticamente e o dropbox do seu amigo vai receber automáticamente
tambem.</p>
<p>Eu estou usando o Dropbox para compartilhar arquivos de estudos com
uns amigos e tambem para sincronizar o meu arquivo do notecase entre o
trabalho e minha casa ( assim não preciso ficar colocando pendrive
toda vez que for usar o notecase ).</p>
<h4 id="shelfari">Shelfari</h4>
<p>O <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/pothix" title="Shelfari">shelfari</a> é uma rede
social para leitores de livros! Lá você pode compartilhar suas
leituras com os amigos, dizendo o que está lendo, o que planeja ler, o
que já leu, fazer resenhas de livros, comentários e mais um monte de
coisas legais.</p>
<p>Gostei bastante da forma que ele organiza os livros, e o layout de
prateleiras é bem legal tambem. Descobri que eles tem um Widget que
adiciona uma prateleira ( bonitinha! ) no seu blog / site e é
totalmente customizável! Gostei! Vou colocar no aqui assim que eu der
uma arrumada no layout do blog.</p>
<h4 id="comunidade-software-livre">Comunidade Software Livre</h4>
<p>Apesar de não gostar muito de redes sociais (para mim fica tudo como
redes anti-sociais) eu achei legal a iniciativa de uma
<a href="http://softwarelivre.org/pothix" title="Software Livre">rede social para software livre</a>!
Seria legal se a grande massa da comunidade estivesse por lá!
:)</p>
<p>Não tem muito o que comentar pois é uma rede social comum como todas
as outras, mas essa tem um foco diferente, que é juntar o pessoal de
software livre em um só lugar. ;)</p>
<p>É isso! Esses são os 3 serviços que eu achei interessante e gostaria
de compartilhar, espero que seja útil para os leitores do blog.</p>

            <title>Organizando seu Gmail para manter Inbox zero</title>

            <description>Agora chegando em tempo de provas e grande acumulo de atividades no trabalho eu fico começando a procurar as brechas de tempo que eu gasto &amp;ldquo;inútilmente&amp;rdquo; para ver se eu consigo aplicar em alguma coisa que possa me ajudar a cumprir todas as tarefas. Fiz uma pequena análise do tempo que eu perdia em determinados lugares, e vi que tanto e-mail como Twitter me consumiam uma grande quantidade de tempo ( com o Twitter é fácil, só desativar temporariamente e seguir menos gente ), portanto decidi fazer um refactoring!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Agora chegando em tempo de provas e grande acumulo de atividades no
trabalho eu fico começando a procurar as brechas de tempo que eu gasto
&ldquo;inútilmente&rdquo; para ver se eu consigo aplicar em alguma coisa que possa
me ajudar a cumprir todas as tarefas. Fiz uma pequena análise do tempo
que eu perdia em determinados lugares, e vi que tanto e-mail como
Twitter me consumiam uma grande quantidade de tempo ( com o Twitter é
fácil, só desativar temporariamente e seguir menos gente ), portanto
decidi fazer um refactoring! :)</p>
<p>Eu uso o conceito de Inbox zero, ou seja, não deixo e-mails pendentes
na minha caixa de entrada, mesmo que eu tenha que tratá-los de modos
diferentes, portanto eu sempre estou olhando a minha caixa de entrada
e me incomoda bastante saber que tenho coisas pendentes lá ( mesmo que
seja só para ler ).</p>
<p>Depois de contar um pouco do drama, vamos ao refactoring! ;)</p>
<h3 id="listas-de-discussão">Listas de discussão</h3>
<p>Atualmente eu assino quase 15 listas de discussão, sendo que sou
moderador na <a href="http://br.groups.yahoo.com/group/gtdbr/">gtd-br</a>
( sobre organização pessoal com o método
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" title="Getting Thigs Done on Wikipedia">Getting Things Done</a>
do <a href="http://www.davidco.com/" title="David Allen">David Allen</a> ) e em mais 2
listas ( Faculdade e amigos do curso técnico ). Várias dessas listas
são ativas e enviam cerca de 3 ( ou mais depentendo da lista ) e-mails
por dia, portanto eu tinha cerca de 30 e-mails por dia somente de
listas de discussão, fora os e-mails que eu recebia externamente.</p>
<p>Uma das medidas que eu sabia que ia me ajudar bastante a manter a
organização da minha caixa de entrada e poupar bastante do meu tempo
era sair de várias listas que eu participava mas nem acompanhava e
colocar todas as que sobrarem como Digest, e foi isso que eu fiz! :D</p>
<h3 id="organizando-as-labels">Organizando as labels</h3>
<p>Tinha uma grande quantidade de labels que eu não estava usando, ou que
criei para uma determinada finalidade e agora não estavam servindo
mais para nada, portanto comecei a ver o que me servia e o que não
servia para reduzir um pouco o que eu devia organizar.</p>
<p>Após retirar as labels que estavam sobrando ( mais ou menos umas 10 ),
comecei a incluir alguns prefixos para poder categorizá-las para
melhor visualização. Utilizei os seguintes prefixos:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Fr] - Projetos freela que eu participei / participo</li>
<li>[Gr] - Listas de discussão ( Groups )</li>
<li>[Ps] - E-mails pessoais que eu gosto de Rotular</li>
<li>[Wk] - E-mails referente ao trabalho que as vezes preciso receber aqui</li>
</ul>
<p>Utilizando esses prefixos nos meus labels eu consegui organizar minhas
coisas por tema, assim vendo facilmente o que eu tenho de pendências.</p>
<h3 id="organizando-os-filtros">Organizando os filtros</h3>
<p>Agora com as minhas labels arrumadas, preciso gerenciar os e-mails que
estão vindo, e para isso eu uso os filtros do Gmail, que encaminham
automaticamente os e-mails para suas determinadas labels, já
arquivando e fazendo outras coisas.</p>
<p>Primeiro criei filtros para as listas de discussão ( que agora vem em
formato Digest ) para arquivar diretamente, colocar na label do
assunto correspondente e marcar com estrela. A idéia de marcar com
estrela foi para resolver um problema que eu tinha antes, que era ter
que ficar passeando em todas as labels olhando digest por digest /
email por e-mail, e agora como tenho todos os e-mails de digest com
estrela, eu posso ler todos de uma vez só e apenas ir retirando a
estrela, e ele já estará arquivado, lido e guardado em sua devida
label! :)</p>
<p>Criei filtros também para os e-mais que eu recebo de fóruns e
newsletters para que eu possa ler apenas quando for possível, sem que
eles precisem ficar alí me incomodando em tempo integral.</p>
<p>Com essa organização eu pude controlar melhor tempo, sendo que todos
os dias quando chego no trabalho tenho os vários Digests das listas de
discussão que acompanho para ler, mas o processo é rápido e fácil,
sendo que vejo apenas os tópicos que me interessam ( baseado no
assunto ), e consigo olhar entre todos facilmente, já deixando
organizado. Agora sei que posso continuar com a minha caixa de entrada
aberta o dia inteiro para enviar e-mails repentinos, sem que isso me
tome tanto tempo.</p>
<p>Se alguem tiver mais dicas poste nos comentários.</p>

            <title>Usando Git em projetos do Google Code</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/git-googlecode/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>Resolvi escrever esse post depois de começar a contribuir para o projeto do vimbook, que está no Google Code.
Como o Google Code só usa Subversion (infelizmente) e eu sou do mundo Git, resolvi usar a ferramenta Git para lidar com SVN, o git-svn! Com ele você pode clonar um repositório SVN e utilizar como Git, e na hora de &amp;ldquo;commitar&amp;rdquo; ele retransforma em SVN.
Já havia tentado usar Git-svn no meu projeto de plugin para wordpress, mas nesse caso eu já tinha um repositório Git e fui tentar mandar para um repositório SVN vazio, o que só me deu dor de cabeça, e no fim das contas acabei jogando para um repositório SVN qualquer só para mandar para o Wordpress.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Resolvi escrever esse post depois de começar a contribuir para o
projeto do
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/vimbook" title="Projeto do VimmBook no Google Code">vimbook</a>,
que está no Google Code.</p>
<p>Como o Google Code só usa <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="Subversion Main Page">Subversion</a>

<p>Já havia tentado usar Git-svn no meu projeto de
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/anti-ie6-army/">plugin para wordpress</a>,
mas nesse caso eu já tinha um repositório Git e fui tentar mandar para
um repositório SVN vazio, o que só me deu dor de cabeça, e no fim das
contas acabei jogando para um repositório SVN qualquer só para mandar
para o Wordpress. No fim das contas, depois desse problema com o
Wordpress eu só tinha abominado o git-svn, mas agora eu estou
começando a descobrir o seu valor.</p>
<p>Meus agradecimentos ao <a href="http://carlancalazans.com/">Carlan Calazans</a>
que me deu umas dicas de Git-svn quando eu comecei a
tentar usar no projeto do plugin, que naquele momento não me fora de
grande serventia, mas depois ajudaram bastante! ;)</p>
<p>Bem, agora chega de papo-furado e vamos a parte que interessa&hellip;Códigos e How To! :)</p>
<p>Primeiramente vamos baixar o código ( estou usando como exemplo o vimbook ):</p>
<pre><code>git-svn clone https://vimbook.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ vimbook --username seu.usuario.do.google
</code></pre>
<p>Ao digitar isso ele vai pedir uma senha que ele gera para a sua conta,
e seus commits ficarão ligados a sua conta do Google. Para obter a sua
senha é só acessar a página de
<a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/settings" title="Página de settings do Google Code">settings do google code</a> com a sua conta.</p>
<p>Após digitar a sua senha ele vai começar a receber todos os commits do
SVN e converter para Git! O processo pode ser um pouco demorado,
dependendo do tamanho do repositório SVN que você está importando.</p>
<p>Quando terminar você terá um repositório Git normal funcionando, e
você pode trabalhar normalmente com ele, fazendo seus branchs e tudo
mais! :D</p>
<p>Vamos ver como seria um fluxo simples para você fazer uma alteração usando branch e mandar de volta para o repositório:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new_changes
</code></pre>
<p>Branch criado! Faça as suas alterações&hellip;</p>
<p>Após as alteraçoes feitas faça os commits normalmente como se faz no
Git e volte ao master para ver o que há de novo no repositório
central:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
git-svn rebase
</code></pre>
<p>Com isso ele vai receber as novas alterações do repositório!</p>
<p>Agora é a hora de fazer um merge do seu branch com a ultima versão do
master:</p>
<pre><code>git merge new_changes
</code></pre>
<p>Se tiver algum conflito resolva-os normalmente e agora é hora de
enviar as suas alterações novamente ao Google Code:</p>
<pre><code>git-svn dcommit
</code></pre>
<p>Pronto! Você está contribuindo para um projeto do Google Code
utilizando Git. :D</p>

            <description>Resolvi postar sobre isso depois de passar por 3 empresas que usam o Google Apps for your Domain e eu sempre esbarrar com o maldito probleminha ao se configurar o Pidgin.
Pensei que isso era burrice minha de não ver a configuração correta, mas depois percebi que não era só eu que não via essas configurações para poder fazer o negócio funcionar! Como eu nunca anotava o processo, sempre tinha que ficar pesquisando para ver se achava algo relacionado a isso, e nunca funcionava.</description>

            <description>Hoje estou aqui para falar um pouco sobre o Ubuntu 9.04! :)
Alguns dias atrás eu postei no twitter que não estava satisfeito com o Ubuntu 9.04, e abaixo descrevo alguns dos motivos.
Primeiramente comecei tentando instalar ele pelo cd (para não ter que deixar o computador ligado mil horas baixando, e tambem por que tenho mais de 1 Ubuntu em casa, portanto mais de mil horas x 2) e não consegui&amp;hellip;.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hoje estou aqui para falar um pouco sobre o Ubuntu 9.04! :)</p>
<p>Alguns dias atrás eu
<a href="http://twitter.com/PotHix/status/1691907398" title="Opinião sobre Ubuntu 9.04">postei no twitter</a>
que não estava satisfeito com o Ubuntu 9.04, e abaixo descrevo alguns dos motivos.</p>
<p>Primeiramente comecei tentando instalar ele pelo cd (para não ter que
deixar o computador ligado mil horas baixando, e tambem por que tenho
mais de 1 Ubuntu em casa, portanto mais de mil horas x 2) e não
consegui&hellip;. Procurei várias informações, desabilitei os sources e
deixei só o cd lá, e vários outros procedimentos, mas mesmo assim não
tive sucesso, e por isso tive que deixar o notebook ligado fazendo
download a noite inteira.</p>
<p>Ao terminar a instalação e reiniciar ele funcionou beleza! :)</p>
<p>Começando a brincar mais com o bichinho, eu descobri que o meu flash
tinha bugado (para variar&hellip;), e as coisas que utilizavam ele
estavam funcionando meia boca, sem contar que ainda tinha alguma
coisa bizarra que funcionava como um
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/">flashblock</a>,
só que pior, por que quando eu clicava ele poderia funcioanar, ou
não. ¬¬</p>
<p>Tentei relevar isso, mas quando fui fazer uns testes com o compiz,
percebi que ele tambem não conseguia mais ativar os efeitos (tudo bem
que eu nem uso&hellip; Mas gostaria que funcionasse pelo menos :P),
retornando uma mensagem de que os efeitos não poderiam ser
habilitados. :(</p>
<p>Estava meio sem tempo para perquisar sobre isso, então ficou assim por
alguns dias, o que me deu um pouco de desânimo, e foi aí que postei no
twitter aquele comentário.</p>
<p>Ontem eu resolvi tirar um tempinho para resolver esses problemas, e
até que foi simples (como de costume)! ;)</p>
<h3 id="resolvendo-problema-do-flash-no-ubuntu-904">Resolvendo problema do Flash no Ubuntu 9.04:</h3>
<p>Eu percebi que estava usando um plugin free do flash, e vi comentários
na internet que esse plugin não é tão bom como o da Adobe (mas
funcionava muito bem no 8.10 :P), portanto resolvi desinstalar e
instalar da Adobe:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove --purge swfdec-mozilla swfdec-gnome mozilla-plugin-gnash gnash
sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
</code></pre>
<p>E o flash já voltou a operar normalmente! :)</p>
<p><strong>OBS:</strong> Se não conseguir resolver com o mesmo procedimento que eu
usei, veja se consegue com um dos
<a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/fix-for-flash-not-working-after-jaunty-upgrade-64bit.html" title="Procedimentos para resolver o problema do Flash no UbuntuGeek">outros 3 procedimentos que tem no UbuntuGeek</a>.</p>
<h3 id="resolvendo-problema-do-compiz-no-ubuntu-904">Resolvendo problema do compiz no Ubuntu 9.04:</h3>
<p>Pesquisando mais sobre o meu problema eu achei
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/363967" title="Bug no launchpad">esse bug no LaunchPad</a>,
com várias pessoas com o mesmo problema, e em um
dos ultimos comentários tem uma dica que resolveu o meu! :)</p>
<p>A minha placa de vídeo estava na blacklist do compiz, e eu comentei o
arquivo, deixando com que ela não fique mais blacklisted:</p>
<p>Abri o arquivo do compiz (que está em <code>/usr/bin/compiz</code>), comentei as
linhas referente a minha placa de vídeo, salvei e reiniciei.</p>
<p>Depois de logar fui testar o compiz, e lá estava ele funcionando
novamente! :D</p>
<p>É claro que eu já desabilitei os efeitos denovo por que não acho legal
ficar trabalhando com eles, mas já está lá funcioanndo para fazer
gracinhas! :P</p>
<p>Espero que seja útil para mais alguém.</p>

<h3 id="cmss-livres-não-reinventado-a-roda-no-desenvolvimento-web">CMS’s livres: não reinventado a roda no desenvolvimento web</h3>
<p>A palestra foi conduzida por Paulino Michelazzo da Fábrica Livre, e
foi uma palestra interessante!</p>
<p>O palestrante soube levar bem a palestra, com momentos engraçados (
várias brincadeiras com Java e Windows, que obviamente não devem ser
levadas a sério ), e apresentando como é fácil criar uma loja virtual
utilizando o Joomla. O que achei legal da palestra foi ele não focar
apenas o Joomla, e sim izer que você não precisa reinventar a roda, e
pode usar várias ferramentas para isso como o Drupal, Wordpress, e
obviamente o Joomla, cada um para sua determinada finalidade.</p>
<p>Crédito para o palestrante: Falou que uma parte do valor que eles
conseguem com os projetos eles doam para os softwares livres que eles
usam, e isso sim é devolver o que você conseguiu gratuitamente!
Parabens a <a href="www.fabricalivre.com.br" title="Fabrica Livre">Fabrica Livre</a>.</p>
<h3 id="scrum">Scrum</h3>
<p>Encontrei um amigos como o Ricardo
(Guitarrista do <a href="http://www.megadriver.com.br" title="Megadriver">Megadriver</a> e programador
Web ) e fiquei &ldquo;networkeando&rdquo; (ou conversando) por um bom tempo sobre
diversas coisas, portanto acabei chegando na metade da palestra.</p>
<p>A palestra foi conduzida por Fabiano Milani, em nome da Caelum, e pelo
que consegui assistir foi aquele overview geral sobre o Scrum (que eu
tambem já tinha visto), e teve uma parte de dúvidas bem legal, com
várias pessoas perguntando como poderia implementar Scrum, ou se
estava implementando Scrum corretamente, com boas respostas do
palestrante.</p>
<p>Para quem nunca tinha visto uma palestra de Scrum deve ter gostado
bastante da palestra. :)</p>
<h3 id="seo---search-engine-optimization">SEO - Search Engine Optimization</h3>
<p>Tambem já tinha assistido outras pelestras sobre esse tema, e elas
geralmente são iguais, portanto para mim não teve muita novidade. De
modo geral, o palestrante Fabio Ricotta da
<a href="http://www.mestreseo.com.br/" title="Mestre SEO">Mestre SEO</a> conduziu bem a
palestra, deu dicas interessantes sobre como organizar a sua página
semanticamente, mostrou várias ferramentas úteis para utilização em
SEO, e várias outras dicas bem interessantes.</p>
<p>Uma coisa legal para enfatizar: SEO não é algo que você faz e pronto,
e sim algo que deve ser mantido e atualizado com o tempo, pois você
não vai ter sempre alta relevância se você aplicou SEO e ficou bem nas
buscas, pois isso vai caindo com o tempo, e você precisa continuar
mantendo isso com boa semântica.</p>
<h3 id="desenvolvimento-web-ágil-ferramentas-arquiteturas-e-princípios">Desenvolvimento web ágil: ferramentas, arquiteturas e princípios</h3>
<p>O <a href="http://twitter.com/gchapiewski" title="Twitter do Guilherme Chapiewski">Guilherme Chapiewski</a>
falou sobre muita coisa legal, avaliando linguagens e frameworks como
Python / Django. Ruby / Rails, Java, PHP / CakePHPe mais outras
coisas. Foi abordado alguns gostos pessoais e experiência própria do
Chapiewski sobre as linguagems e frameworks, inclusive algumas
considerações sobre Rails e Scala (¬¬), mas a abordagem disso foi
com dicas de como poderia ser resolvido de meios diferentes, com
problemas que são conhecidos e poderiam ser tratados para ajudar.</p>
<p>Ele comentou de 7 métodos que ele usa como um programador ágil:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soluções a longo prazo</li>
<li>Sempre pensar no que pode acontecer futuramente. Ele usou um exemplo bem legal sobre um cara que não documentou um sistema por que não tinha tempo, quando futuramente 3 pessoas perderam cada uma 2 dias para entender o que aquilo fazia&hellip;Ou seja no fim das contas foi perdido mais tempo do que ganhado nesse caso.</li>
<li>Elimine desperdícios</li>
<li>Usar um framework que cria tudo facilmente e você pode portar ele facilmente para outras features</li>
<li>Qualidade não é negociável</li>
<li>Aqui outro bom exemplo&hellip;O médico está limpando o paciente após uma cirurgia e o paciente fala para ele deixar isso por que está atrasado para alguma coisa, e é claro que o médico vai te ignorar  e limpar, por que ele sabe o que é o certo para se fazer, ele não negociaria a qualidade do trabalho por causa do seu tempo.</li>
<li>Não esconda os problemas do cliente</li>
<li>O cliente é um cara legal e sua solição simplista pode ser o suficiente para ele</li>
<li>Use a melhor ferramenta para cada problema</li>
<li>E lá vamos com bons exemplo: Um marceneiro não usaria um martelo para cortar uma mesa sendo que ele poderia usar uma serra para isso. Portanto use sempre o mais adequado para cada situação</li>
<li>Documente menos e simplifique mais</li>
<li>Foi mostrado um bom exemplo de código, que você olhava e intuitivamente sabia o que ele fazia.</li>
<li>Reflita sempre sobre o que você faz e melhore comtinuamente</li>
<li>Não fique apertando parafuso para sempre, sempre renove seus conhecimentos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Os argumentos do Chapiewski sobre Java ser o novo COBOL é bem
interessante! Ele diz que o JAVA antigamente tinha ótimos motivos para
ser adotado, e assim muitas empresas começaram a utilizar, e
atualmente temos sistemas monstros desenvolvidos e vários
programadores programando em Java, portanto para sair da linguagem não
vai ser tão fácil assim, e foi isso que aconteceu com o COBOL. O
Chapiewski falou que só usa Java hoje em dia se tiver um sistema que é
obrigado a integrar com Java, por que ele não ve um bom motivo para
usar Java, sendo que ele pode usar coisas que ele considera melhor e
com mais benefícios.</p>
<h3 id="the-rails-way---como-ruby-on-rails-pode-te-tornar-um-programador-pior">The Rails Way - Como Ruby on Rails pode te tornar um programador pior</h3>
<p>O <a href="http://nomedojogo.com" title="Blog do Carlos Brando">Carlos Brando</a> falou
e muito bem sobre o Ruby! Falou muita coisa que eu tinha vontade de
dizer sobre Ruby != Rails utilizando um exemplo de miojo e
macarronada, como seu o miojo fosse o framework para o suposto
cozinheiro! :D</p>
<p>Vários exemplos com código para mostrar como o Ruby é parecido com a
nossa lingua, e não com a lingua do computador, inclusive usando uns
exemplos simplificados do Why. Teve alguns exemplos de metaprogramação
para saciar a vontade de quem já conhece um pouquinho de Ruby tambem!
:)</p>
<p>Gostei bastante da ideia da palestra e o por que de você se tornar um
programador pior ( você saindo de uma outra linuguagem que você se
considerava bom, para uma outra coisa que você não sabe nada ), e
ainda mais mostrando os facilitadores dos frameworks que ajudam você,
mas abstrai um pouco da sua felicidade em desenvolver um pouquinho
mais low. :P</p>
<h3 id="mercado-de-trabalho-em-ti">Mercado de trabalho em TI</h3>
<p>Foi uma &ldquo;mesa redonda&rdquo; com todos os palestrantes, discutindo sobre
assuntos sugeridos pelo pessoal que estava assistindo o evento. Foi
discutido sobre os valores de trabalho no mercado, apoio as
universidades pelo governo, scrum, software livre e outras coisas.</p>

<p>Gostei bastante do evento, consegui conversar várias pessoas legais

            <description>Se você já conhece Ruby, ignore esse post! A idéia do post é mostrar um pouco da linguagem Ruby para pessoas que não conhecem nada sobre ela.
Eu, claro, acho muito interessante que muita gente por aí ainda não conhece Ruby, mesmo com a grande popularização do Rails, e eu chego a ouvir coisas assim:
 &amp;ldquo;Não é você que programa naquela linguagem esquisita?&amp;rdquo;
 Cheguei a ouvir do meu &amp;ldquo;professor de algoritmo&amp;rdquo; (perdeu meu respeito):</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Se você já conhece Ruby, ignore esse post! A idéia do post é mostrar
um pouco da linguagem Ruby para pessoas que não conhecem nada sobre
ela.</p>
<p>Eu, claro, acho muito interessante que muita gente por aí ainda não
conhece Ruby, mesmo com a grande popularização do Rails, e eu chego a
ouvir coisas assim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Não é você que programa naquela linguagem esquisita?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cheguei a ouvir do meu &ldquo;professor de algoritmo&rdquo; (perdeu meu respeito):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Gostei desse algoritmo que você fez nessa linguagem esquisita aqui&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Há muitas pessoas que já ouviram falar em algo relacionado a Ruby
apenas quando leram alguma coisa na Info falando de
RubyOnRails. Portanto, resolvi escrever alguns posts sobre a linguagem
para passar para esse pessoal que ainda não conhece nada. Pretendo que
esse seja o post introdutório de vários capítulos passando por partes
interessantes da linguagem. :)</p>
<h3 id="entãovamos-falar-de-ruby-">Então&hellip;Vamos falar de Ruby! :)</h3>
<p>Ruby é uma linguagem interpretada, criada pelo japonês
<a href="http://www.rubyist.net/%7Ematz/" title="">Yukihiro “matz” Matsumoto</a> e
liberada publicamente em 1995. Desde lá o Ruby vem aparecendo bastante
no mundo de tecnologia, sendo que a partir de 2006 teve um grande boom
de comentários, ainda mais com o maior aparecimento do
<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="RubyOnRails">Rails</a>.</p>
<p>Uma coisa que me irrita bastante é as pessoas associarem diretamente
Ruby com Rails, portanto preciso deixar isso claro&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rails não é Ruby!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rails é um framework para desenvolvimento web que <strong>utiliza</strong> a
linguagem Ruby para o tal. O Ruby tem bem mais coisas legais do que
só o Rails. ;)</p>
<p>Como o Ruby é uma linguagem interpretada, podemos facilmente fazer um Hello World em Ruby:</p>
<pre><code>puts 'Hello World'
</code></pre>
<p>Isso aí! Apenas uma linha! Uma linguagem totalmente orientada a objeto
e você não precisa necessáriamente criar uma classe, um método (
public static void main&hellip; ) e escrever mil comandos Hierarquicamente
para escrever algo! ;)</p>
<p>O interessante do Ruby é que tudo é um objeto, ou seja, se você escreve o numero 10 ele já é um objeto, tendo seus próprios métodos, como por exemplo:</p>
<pre><code>10.times { puts 'Vou estudar Ruby' }
</code></pre>
<p>No caso acima usamos um dos métodos do 10 (que é da Classe Fixnum)
que é o método times, que faz um loop 10 (ou qualquer outro numero
Fixnum que estivesse aqui ) vezes fazendo o que está dentro do bloco,
no caso, imprimir &ldquo;vou estudar Ruby&rdquo;. :)</p>
<p>No Ruby você consegue modificar métodos em tempo de execução! Uma
classe que não possuía nenhum método pode possuir 10 em tempo de
execução bastando que seu código os inclua lá, e isso é uma coisa
muito legal!</p>
<p>A sintaxe da linguagem foi feita para ser simples, você tem vários
métodos facilitadores, inclusive com uso de &ldquo;?&rdquo; ( interrogação ) para
alguns métodos, como por exemplo para descobrir se a variável está não
retorna nada:</p>
<pre><code>variavel.nil?
</code></pre>
<p>Aqui temos uma pergunta explícita, que você olhando isso
intuitivamente lhe vem duas respostas: Sim ou não ( nem me venha com
talvez :P ),o que mostra que você olha um código Ruby e facilmente
distingue muita coisa.</p>
<p>E tem bem mais <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/sobre-o-ruby/">coisas</a>
<a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(linguagem_de_programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o)" title="Artigo sobre Ruby na Wikipedia">interessantes</a>!</p>
<h3 id="táe-por-que-diabos-eu-deveria-usar-ruby">Tá&hellip;E por que diabos eu deveria usar Ruby</h3>
<p>Aí que está! É aí que entram as coisas legais, como:</p>
<h4 id="rails">Rails</h4>
<p>Agora sim você pode usar esse cara aí em cima para desenvolver
aplicações bem legais usando todas as facilidades que o Ruby pode te
oferecer</p>
<h4 id="shoes">Shoes</h4>
<p>Uma biblioteca bem interessante para desenvolvimento desktop
multiplataforma, onde você consegue fazer muita coisa legal.</p>
<h4 id="jruby">JRuby</h4>
<p>Olha que legal, se você gosta bastante do Java, você pode rodar
programas Ruby em cima da maquina virtual Java, o que é bem legal, até
por que, a velocidade do JRuby, já passou a do MRI ( Matz Ruby
Interpreter, ou a versão core oficial do Ruby, feita pelo Matz ).</p>
<p>Inclusive você pode importar várias bibliotecas do Java e tudo
mais. ;)</p>
<h4 id="iron-ruby">Iron Ruby</h4>
<p>Você usa a plataforma .NET da Microsoft? Então procure por esse cara!
Eu não tenho muito a comentar por que não uso .NET.</p>
<p>É claro que não existem só esses aí em cima, apenas estou citando
algumas coisas legais, mas se você procura por desenvolvimento web
você pode escolher <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a>,
<a href="http://merbivore.com/" title="Merb Official Home Page">Merb</a> (ainda não se
fundiu com o Rails, mas isso vai acontecer na versão 3 do Rails), ou
outros.</p>
<p>E se você apenas pensa em desenvolver para Desktop, alem do Shoes,
você pode escolher, o <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/gtk/">RubyGTK</a>,
o <a href="http://www.macruby.org/" title="MacRuby">MacRuby</a> (para
usuários MAC) ou até o
<a href="http://www.fxruby.org/" title="FXRuby Official Page">FXRuby</a>!</p>
<p>Se você não é programador, e trabalha com administração de sistemas,
por que não utilizar Ruby para automatizar as tarefas? É fácil, tem
manutenção simples, vem padrão em várias distribuições Linux&hellip;Não tem
desculpa! :P</p>
<p>Meu foco nesse post não é abordar a fundo nenhuma das ferramentas que
eu citei acima, e sim apenas dar um overview de tudo que você pode
fazer usando essa linguagem.</p>
<h3 id="puxa-gostei-como-usar">Puxa, gostei! Como usar?</h3>
<p>Moleza! Está no Linux né? Se estiver usando Ubuntu só dê os comandos mágicos:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ruby irb rdoc
</code></pre>
<p>Não está no Linux? Humm&hellip;No Windows é fácil tambem, baixe o
executável e instale. Não tive muito contato com um mac ainda para
instalar coisas e tudo mais, mas me parece fácil.</p>
<p>Basta clicar <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/downloads/">aqui</a> e pegar os
arquivos necessários para a instalação! :D</p>
<h3 id="vixeinstalei-e-agora">Vixe&hellip;Instalei, e agora?</h3>
<p>Agora é hora de brincar um pouco com a linguagem para saber como ela
funciona! Eu recomendo você a entrar no
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell" title="Interactive
Ruby Shell at Wikipedia">IRB</a> (<strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>R</strong>u<strong>b</strong>y Shell) e
começar a brincar!</p>
<p>Para acessar o irb é aquela moleza de sempre, apenas entre no terminal
e chame por irb ( acho que funciona assim no Windows tambem )! :D</p>
<p>Lá você pode tentar executar uns códigos, inclusive os poucos exemplos
que eu postei aqui, é muito legal para você conhecer a linguagem,
descobrir uns métodos e tudo mais.</p>
<h3 id="já-estou-no-irb-mas-eu-não-sei-fazer-nada">Já estou no IRB, mas eu não sei fazer nada&hellip;</h3>
<p>Bem, agora é partir para as cabeças! :D</p>
<ol>
<li>Eu recomendo você a começar lendo o <a href="http://eustaquiorangel.com/downloads/tutorialruby.pdf" title="Tutorial de Ruby do TaQ">tutorial de Ruby do TaQ</a> que é um material bem legal para começar.</li>
<li>Se seu ingles é bom (não precisa ser fluente, mas você precisa saber ler e enteder) eu aconselho firmemente você a participar de algum curso Core do <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/" title="Rubylearning.org">Rubylearning.org</a>, e lá você vai aprender bastante coisa, alem de se divertir bastante.</li>
<li>Leia alguns dos livros gratuitos que estão disponíveis na web gratuitamente e em português! Eu recomendo o <a href="http://aprendaaprogramar.rubyonrails.pro.br/" title="Aprenda a programar traduzido pela comunidade">Aprenda a Programar</a> e o <a href="http://why.nomedojogo.com/" title="O (comovente) guia de Ruby do Why traduzido pela comunidade">(comovente) guia de Ruby do Why</a>. ( obrigado pela dica <a href="http://blog.abrcoelho.net/" title="Blog do Abraão">Abraão</a> )</li>
<li>Participe de Grupos de usuários para aumentar seus conhecimentos e conhecer pessoas que tambem estão interessadas na linguagem e sempre estudando! Se você está em São Paulo eu recomento fortemente você a participar do <a href="http://guru-sp.org" title="Grupo de usuários Ruby de São Paulo">GURU-SP</a>! :)</li>
<li>Fique de olho aqui no blog que eu pretendo começar a postar umas coisas básicas, mas não espere somente por mim e já inicie seus estudos! ;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Bem, com isso você já tem uma pequena base do que é o Ruby ( e sabe
que o Rails é apenas um framework feito em Ruby ) e já pode começar a
se divertir com ele! :D</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="first-words"><strong>First Words</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Willian Molinari as Marcelo said, I participated of 3rd
Batch of Rubylearning at the beginning of the last year. Since the
finish of the course I was an Assistant Teacher, and i&rsquo;m a Mentor
since the beginning of this year.  I attempt to show to you a bit of
what Rubylearning is and how does it work, what is the course idea.
It is a short presentation, you will see that I&rsquo;ll &ldquo;run&rdquo; with the
content, but the presentation idea is to show you a bit of what
RubyLearning courses are.</p>
<h3 id="slide1"><strong>Slide1</strong></h3>
<p>Fist, lets start with &ldquo;What is Rubylearning?&rdquo; The course itself is
Rubylearning.org, and Rubylearning is divided into Blog, Website and
courses.
Blog is where Satish post some of his interviews with Ruby community
guys like Matt of Merb project or Dr. Nic. And on blog have other cool
posts too.
On Website Satish maintain a Ruby tutorial, a Ruby Book and post other ruby
contents.</p>
<p>And on Rubylearning.org the course happens.</p>
<h3 id="slide2"><strong>Slide2</strong></h3>
<p>To answer the question &ldquo;What is Rubyleraning.org&rdquo; I was helped by the other
teachers of Rubylearning. One of the good answers was made by George
Thompson, this guy that you see in the large photo. After telling a
funny joke, saying that Rubylearning is for everything since it will &ldquo;allow you to grow wings to fly&rdquo; and will &ldquo;help you in the bedroom&rdquo;
He gives these topics to speak about.
The first thing is that Rubylearning is for everyone that has an interest in
Ruby, if you are a experienced professional, or just learning now, Rubylearning is here to help you.
It is a framework to your first steps with Ruby, so you will not depend just
from Google or online tutorials, on Rubylearning you will have more people
to help you to participate and discuss your answers and so on&hellip;
Rubylearning is not just for who are starting with Ruby. If you work with
Ruby for a long time, you can participate to help the students that are
starting, returning to the community what you received. And you can participate
with other Rubylearning intermediate courses (Rubylearning doesn&rsquo;t have just
the Core course, we have other courses for those who already have
knowledge of Ruby)
And of course&hellip;Rubylearning is a place to have fun! To code for fun, to
know different people of other countries, or maybe of your country, and you
didn&rsquo;t know that this person was programming on this language.</p>
<h3 id="slide3">Slide3</h3>
<p>Rubyleraning is based on Moodle, as you can see, the image is strange
here, but the first screenshot is the screen after you sign up, and you
can see all the courses that you can subscribe to, and below you can see the
screen inside the course, all the material is divided by blocks, the forums and so on.</p>
<h3 id="slide4">Slide4</h3>
<p>More interesting informations about Rubylearning:</p>
<p>We are the declared winner of shorty awards in education category.
Unfortunately we couldn&rsquo;t participate of ceremony in USA because only Satish
can participate in the ceremony, and the price to travel from India (Satish is Indian) to USA could not cover the
costs&hellip;But anyway, we are the winners!</p>
<p>The number of participants get over 7200 mark, and maybe now we already pass
the 7500 mark, because this information is from 1 month ago, more or less.</p>
<p>Another cool thing, more than 40% of Rubylearning participants are from
Brazil, so you don&rsquo;t have arguments to say: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t participate, because
the course have people that from other countries and i don&rsquo;t speak english
very well&rdquo;, because always you will find a Brazillian to help you there.</p>
<h3 id="slide5">Slide5</h3>
<p>And who is the main teacher? Who is behind Rubylearning?</p>
<h3 id="slide6">Slide6</h3>
<p>Satish Talim, as I said, lives in India. He is a programmer, teacher,
consultant, working on some companies at India and USA, is speaker and has
more than 30 years of experience with I.T. He has these two domains:
Rubylearning.org and rubylearning.com. On .org domain we have the course
and on Rubylearning.com is his site. And he have a personal website domain, too.</p>
<h3 id="slide7">Slide7</h3>
<p>Ok, if Satish is behind Rubylearning, who are these guys that help on
forums? So&hellip; I asked to Satish by e-mail, because I didn&rsquo;t know about how he divide us.
The assistant teachers are people that come from the core course and
enjoyed the course, so they are invited to help, and whomever accept comes as
assistant teachers of the next core course to help on foruns, answering the
students that are having doubts and helping on other things.</p>
<p>Mentors are experieced professionals that are working with I.T for a long
time and more time on Rubylearning, too. They help not only on Core course,
but on the other courses ( intermediate courses ) too.
The Patrons, this guys are on Rubylearning since rubylearning is coming to
be international, on the 2nd batch more or less, on the last months of
2007, and they have more time on rubylearning, so the way that Satish has
to classify teacher is time on rubylearning.</p>
<h3 id="slide8">Slide8</h3>
<p>For who is this course appropriate? Well&hellip; Our focus is the people
that already know something about programming, some other language and
wants to know Ruby, and not those people that do not know how to
program and want to learn on Rubylearning, This is not our focus. Our
focus is to teach Ruby for who those have a notion about programming.</p>
<h3 id="slide9">Slide9</h3>
<p>How does Rubylearning work? Well&hellip;The course is slotted into weekly study
material blocks. Every Saturday, Satish posts different sudy material with
important notes, so you can review quickly all you already read; Some
exercises, 10 or 5 exercises depending on how extensive is the material,
for you to solve and post on forums, to view the answers of teachers too.</p>
<p>For example, you have a method and you are using return to return the
variable on the PHP style for example, but can be other language, so
somebody replies to you saying that you don&rsquo;t need to specify this
return because the Ruby language returns the last statement by
default, and so on&hellip;  The Quiz, is for your own benefit, so you can
see if you learn all the content.</p>
<p>And the Extras! The extras take to you some good material as links to good
content, a screencast related to the weekly study material, and others!</p>
<h3 id="slide10">Slide10</h3>
<p>How do quizzes work? As i said, Quiz is for your own benefit. A lot of
people are questioning me about the importance of quizzes on the course
participation, &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t answer the quiz, are we kicked out of the
course&rdquo; or we don&rsquo;t receive the certificate. The quiz idea is auto-validation,
so after you read all the content, you will know with the quiz if you really
learn all you need to learn about that content, if you got a good result
with the quiz, you probably really learned this weeks content.</p>
<h3 id="slide11">Slide11</h3>
<p>Is necessary be active on Foruns? Humm&hellip;Yes! The main focus of
Rubylearning is the participation of everybody, so, if you really want to
get the best of the course you must to post your exercise answers, to
receive from more experienced people feedback about your solution. If you
don&rsquo;t participate so much.. it&rsquo;s okay too&hellip;You just lost the chance to learn more and
more.</p>
<h3 id="slide12">Slide12</h3>
<p>This is one of the things that everybody speaks about&hellip;&ldquo;Ohhh&hellip;The course
is in english, from India, i will talk nonsense words, i don&rsquo;t speak
english, my english is bad&rdquo;&hellip;Humm&hellip;My personal English, i&rsquo;m a assistant
teacher, is not so good, but i can communicate with others! If you can
communicate with other people is good enough! You will read and understand
the content and post your code on forums, if you are not comfortable to
write english, you can just post your code, somebody will reply to you, you
will understand the reply and it is good enough to your learning. If you
can talk is really better, because you can help on discussions, but the
english is not a big barrier to participate of Rubylearning.</p>
<h3 id="slide13">Slide13</h3>
<p>How is the course pace? As i said, Satish does weekly content posts on
forums&hellip;Not forums&hellip;the study materials. You don&rsquo;t need to follow this
weekly pace, if you decide to view all the course in the last week you can,
but we recommend you to follow weekly because you can talk with other
people that are studying the same lesson and you have more focus on your
studies making it easy to learn different things.</p>
<h3 id="slide14">Slide14</h3>
<p>What topics the course cover? Well&hellip;We cover all the Beginning with Ruby,
from Ruby installation through&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="slide16">Slide16</h3>
<p>basic classes like numbers, blocks, variable scopes, constants, methods,
manipulation of text files, Regular Expressions, but only the basis of
Regular Expressions, how to work with RE with Ruby, working with classes,
inheritance, exceptions&hellip; We can&rsquo;t cover tests (the Ruby test/Unit class)
on the core course just a bit of it, we want to create a course just to
cover test/unit itself, so it is not a core part of Ruby in this course.</p>
<h3 id="slide17">Slide17</h3>
<p>Other questions that are often made to me when I recommend Rubylearning
couse is: &ldquo;I will receive a certificate?&rdquo;. The important thing on the
Rubylearning course is how much you can learn with the course, the
certificate is not the course focus, but&hellip;The answer is YES!</p>
<h3 id="slide18">Slide18</h3>
<p>This is my certificate from 3rd Batch that i participated, really
beautiful, signed by Satish, you receive in PDF, is not received in paper,
but you can print and store.</p>
<h3 id="slide19">Slide19</h3>
<p>As i said, Rubylearning is not made of only the Core course, we have a
lot of other courses that we call the &ldquo;Intermediate courses&rdquo;, and is
appropriate to who that already have a notion of what is Ruby core, if you
know core, you can move on to these other courses.</p>
<h3 id="slide20">Slide20</h3>
<p>The merb course, now merb team are joining Rails team, maybe this course
will be extinct, but this is one of our courses for now.
Git / GitHub is a course of one week. Git is not directly connected with
ruby, but all the Ruby community are using it, so we decided to prepare
a course about it.
Ruby with database, using MySql and sqlite, you learn on how to use
activerecord to manipulate a database from a script Ruby.
FXRuby as Marcelo said in another speech.
Sinatra for web development, maybe will get the Merb course place, because
Merb and Rails will be one.
Shoes, as Marcelo said too, for Desktop development, very interesting.
Ruby and Twitter, is a course that will be released now, i don&rsquo;t know when
it will start, maybe april 14th or 16th, for who those already have a ruby
knowledge, will be very interesting. They will show how to play with
&ldquo;Twitter API&rdquo; and make some interesting things with it.
And Rails 3, Satish promised that when Rails 3 is comming out he will
create a course about it to everybody.</p>
<h3 id="slide21">Slide21</h3>
<p>This is some screenshots of shoes course. The application of the screenshot
on the Right was made by Satoshi, that was the main teacher of Rubylearning
shoes course, and is is a clock that show all the assistant teachers and
mentors timezone on the world, all teacher have a photo placed on with their
timezone.
I asked Satoshi to send a message to all of you, and he sent to me a
message with a &ldquo;Google translation&rdquo; Phrase in portuguese saying &ldquo;Oi todo
mundo&rdquo; that probably is &ldquo;hello everybody&rdquo;, and he says that you don&rsquo;t need
to care about your english because we can communicate with Ruby, and he
wants to see you on Rubylearning Forums. Here you can see other screenshot
of a little game that they do with shoes, each student have your own game,
you can see a &ldquo;questions and answers&rdquo; game on the next screenshot. Very
interesting and a lot of fun!</p>
<h3 id="slide22">Slide22</h3>
<p>Here you have a message from Satish Talim, i asked to him to send one, and
he is saying thanks to all Brazilian friends, Locaweb and Fabio Akita,
that are sponsors of the course, the locaweb is a Sponsor of the core
course, and saying thanks to you that are helping to spreading ruby around
the world.</p>
<h3 id="slide23---questions">Slide23 - Questions</h3>
<p>My presentation idea is to be very quick, just to show to you a bit of
what is Rubylearning and how you can participate, what you will learn and
so on&hellip;
Somebody have some question?</p>
<p><strong>Hugo:</strong> This courses that you show, all of them are free? Or have some paid
courses too?</p>
<p><strong>Willian:</strong> Yes, the core course is free. The other courses you need to pay to
get in, but the cost is very low, something like 5 dollars, 3 or 5 dollars,
just to maintain the website, Satish put a lot of his time on Rubylearning,
so he need a way to maintain all of this, and he is making it with this
paid courses and some sponsors, but is not high price, just 3 or 5 dollars
with paypal.</p>
<p>Some other question? I trampled some content because I have little time.</p>
<p><strong>Marcelo:</strong> Lets thank Willian, no more questions now&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="slide23">slide23</h3>

            <description>Como todos sabem eu sou do mundo Ruby/Rails (Não sou xiita mas é o que mais gosto) e de vez em quando começo a brincar com coisas diferentes para poder formar a minha própria opinião sobre o assunto. No mes de fevereiro me surgiu um projeto bem interessante para trabalhar, pessoas legais, oportunidade legal, bem interessante! O projeto seria feito em Python/Django, e achei bem interessante a idéia de poder comparar várias coisas do Rails com o Django.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Como todos sabem eu sou do mundo Ruby/Rails (Não sou xiita mas é o
que mais gosto) e de vez em quando começo a brincar com coisas
diferentes para poder formar a minha própria opinião sobre o assunto.
No mes de fevereiro me surgiu
<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/development/projeto-de-fevereiro" title="Projeto de fevereiro">um projeto bem interessante para trabalhar</a>,
pessoas legais, oportunidade legal, bem interessante! O projeto seria
feito em Python/Django, e achei bem interessante a idéia de poder
comparar várias coisas do Rails com o Django.</p>
<p>Bem&hellip;Vamos as minhas comparações:</p>
<h3 id="pontos-fortes">Pontos fortes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Como primeiro argumento, e incontestável para mim, tenho que dizer que o admin do Django é muito legal! Você consegue fazer coisas bonitinhas e funcionais com uma facilidade espantosa! Sei que no Rails podemos fazer um scaffold ( ou até usar o ActiveScaffold, mas não é tão bom ) e criar facilmente um CRUD para mexer nos dados, mas isso não é um admin pronto, é apenas uma forma fácil de se manipular os dados. Penso eu que com o Rails seja mais facil de se criar um admin personalizado, com Design próprio, mas gostei bastante da solução a curto prazo do Django.</li>
<li>Achei bem interessante como podemos fazer a divisão de trabalhos com o nosso HTML(er) / JavaScript(er), por que o Django dá pouquíssima liberdade para o template com relação a código, ou seja, você define na sua view as query&rsquo;s que vão ser mandadas para o template e no template ele vai usar apenas o que você pode mandar, e não vai poder consultar ou fazer maiores alterações no conteúdo, portanto, quem deve cuidar de como o conteúdo vai chegar ao template são os programadores que vão enviar os dados para quem vai fazer a integração com o layout.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pontos-fracos">Pontos fracos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Não encontrei uma padronização / centralização para os plugins do Django&hellip;Você encontra vários modos de instalação para determinados plugins, alguns vem com setup.py, outros falam para você jogar na pasta do Python. Não tem algo centralizado como as gems do Rails ou os próprios plugins para jogar na pasta vendor/plugins, ou usar um script/plugin install &hellip;</li>
<li>Não cria uma estrutura de pastas, deixando que você faça o que bem entender com a estrutura, ao invés de usar uma convenção sobre configuração.</li>
<li>Talvez seja a inexperiencia, mas eu não achei legal o que tivemos que fazer com o settings, pois cada um precisava colocar uma configuração diferente de diretórios de imagens, ou algumas configurações referentes aos plugins ( filebrowser no caso ), portanto cada um tinha que ter um settings.py diferente, informando o settings.py quando vamos executar alguma coisa.</li>
<li>Não me acostumei muito bem com o esquema de indentação do Python&hellip;Não que seja ruim, mas como estavamos trabalhando em sistemas operacionais diferentes de vez em quando aparecia um indentation error por causa de conversões de tabs em espaços e tal. Sei que esse argumento vai ser facilmente contestado com um: &ldquo;É só configurar o seu editor de texto&rdquo; ou &ldquo;usa um editor de texto multiplataforma&rdquo;, mas mesmo assim&hellip;A idéia da indentação é legal, mas ainda me atrapalha um pouco.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bem, é isso! Essas foram as minhas primeiras impressões do Django,
como disse, não tinha experiência com o framework e muitas coisas
poderiam ser evitadas mais facilmente, ou feitas de um modo bem
melhor.</p>
<p>Continuo gostando bastante do Rails, mas achei muito legal várias
idéias do Django, e acho que tem aplicações legais dependendo do
projeto que você for usar. ;)</p>

            <description>Como muitos leitores do Blog sabem, eu palestrei no Evento &amp;ldquo;Ruby e Rails no mundo real&amp;rdquo;, e vou fazer um pequeno overview desse evento que eu havia divulgado aqui no blog:
O evento foi bem interessante, bem alem do que nós havíamos planejado nas primeiras conversas do primeiro encontro do GURU-SP, e atendeu bastante as nossas expectativas por ser o primeiro. Obviamente cometemos alguns erros que vamos melhorar no próximo, como garantir que tenha Wi-Fi por exemplo!</description>

&ldquo;<a href="http://www.temporealeventos.com.br/?area=130" title="Ruby e Rails no mundo real">Ruby e Rails no mundo real</a>&rdquo;,
e vou fazer um pequeno overview desse evento que eu
<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/events/ruby-e-rails-no-mundo-real" title="Ruby e Rails no mundo real">havia divulgado aqui no blog</a>:</p>
<p>O evento foi bem interessante, bem alem do que nós havíamos planejado
nas primeiras conversas do
<a href="http://guru-sp.com/index.php/Eventos_da_Comunidade" title="Primeiro encontro do GURU-SP">primeiro encontro do GURU-SP</a>,
e atendeu bastante as nossas expectativas por ser o
primeiro. Obviamente cometemos alguns erros que vamos melhorar no
próximo, como garantir que tenha Wi-Fi por exemplo! :)</p>
<p>Quanto as palestras, tivemos palestras interessantes, sendo a maioria
delas de um grau não tão técnico como alguns estavam esperando, mas
quem sabe no próximo planejamos algo mais hard para mostrar. ;)</p>
<p>Eu palestrei sobre o Rubylearning e acho que me saí bem, não foi a
melhor palestra do evento (nem de longe&hellip;heheh) mas acho que
consegui passar o que eu gostaria para a galera, espero ver mais
pessoas lá no <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/" title="Rubylearning.org">Rubylearning</a>!</p>
<p>Para quem estiver afim de ver como foram os Slides pode dar uma olhada
na versão em inglês que eu postei para mostrar para o pessoal do
Rubylearning no
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PotHix/what-is-and-how-does-work-rubylearningorg-1257258" title="Slides no Slideshare em inglês">Slideshare</a>,
e se alguem que não recebeu a apostila com os Slides quer ver a verão
em português é só pedir que eu posto tambem. :)</p>
<p>O <a href="http://www.agaelebe.com.br/" title="Site do agaelebe">agaelebe</a> gravou
todas as palestras e assim que possível vai disponibilizar para os que
não foram (e para os que foram e querem revisar algo).</p>
<p>Criamos uma <a href="http://guru-sp.com/index.php/Ruby_e_Rails_no_mundo_real_-_primeira_edi%C3%A7%C3%A3o" title="Primeira edição do evento do GURU-SP">página no GURU-SP.org</a>
para divulgar todas as informações sobre o evento, portanto se quiser
saber qual foi a grade de palestras, ver as fotos e ver os vídeos (
assim que estiverem disponíveis ) é só acessar!</p>

            <description>No mês de fevereiro eu estive envolvido com um projeto bem interessante na empresa que estou trabalhando (ainda vamos trabalhar mais em nosso site 😛), que foi feito em Python / Django e deveria gerar páginas estáticas ( exigência do projeto ).
Tivemos um prazo muito curto para tudo que deveria ser feito, o que gerou uma grande quantidade de trabalho fora do horário e dos dias comuns. Entre o começo e o fim do projeto, tínhamos o carnaval, portanto tivemos que deixar nossos espíritos carnavalescos guardados e partir para o trabalho árduo no feriado até horas indeterminadas.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No mês de fevereiro eu estive envolvido com um projeto bem
interessante na <a href="http://www.whitehat.com.br/" title="Whitehat Software">empresa que estou trabalhando</a> (ainda vamos
trabalhar mais em nosso site 😛), que foi feito em Python / Django e
deveria gerar páginas estáticas ( exigência do projeto ).</p>
<p>Tivemos um prazo muito curto para tudo que deveria ser feito, o que
gerou uma grande quantidade de trabalho fora do horário e dos dias
comuns. Entre o começo e o fim do projeto, tínhamos o carnaval,
portanto tivemos que deixar <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mHmy-foJwpAQDav4MeKhpA?feat=directlink" title="Veja a alegria!">nossos espíritos carnavalescos</a> guardados
e partir para o trabalho árduo no feriado até horas indeterminadas.</p>
<p>O ambiente de trabalho era bem legal, trabalhamos onde chamávamos de
The Rubens, que tinha tudo o que precisávamos para nos sentir a
vontade:</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jVW8dd3JY7WCrCz0hiV_UQ?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="/images/posts/projeto_fevereiro_instrumento.jpg" alt="Foto de uma Sitar no The Rubens" title="Sitar"></a>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-vMfDbnPkfAvctXMJRjzWA?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="/images/posts/projeto_fevereiro_violao.jpg" alt="Foto dos violões do Rubens" title="Violões"></a>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NoofOiWk-FpJKbQaEJ0jHA?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="/images/posts/projeto_fevereiro_biblioteca.jpg" alt="Foto dos livros da biblioteca do Rubens" title="Biblioteca"></a></p>
<p>Obviamente nada melhor do que instrumentos (para uma leve descontraída
antes de voltar ao trabalho árduo), pessoas motivadas, barrinhas de
cereal, livros (vários nomes interessantíssimos nessa biblioteca!) e
programação! A única coisa que não tínhamos era tempo o suficiente
para fazer tudo tranquilamente, mas aproveitamos bastante o tempo.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/C9GP7QYcyrNlXOIvbH6B7Q?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bXWgXlrMJ55dk3wesmhpZx-n1iFNfLRJu_kD-wIF0YI=w720-h900-no" alt="Foto do relógio marcando quase duas horas da manhã quando estava indo para casa" title="Olha o horário"></a></p>
<p>Trabalhamos todos os dias durante o carnaval, sábado, domingo, de
madrugada, e em qualquer outro horário que fosse possivel ( hehe ).
Nosso repositório Git já estava bem legal no gráfico de Network do
GitHub, entre emaranhados coloridos!</p>
<p>Durante o caminho tivemos que enfrentar alguns contratempos, como o
calor infernal, a falta de energia elétrica, a quantidade de novidades
para lidar, tanto com o Python / Django, como com o Git e outras coisas
mais!</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WKEYkHv63No08HDzdQNmpw?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WvzTz_kVWsQ/SdOp0dF8fcI/AAAAAAAABiU/KJl8daqu0uA/w720-h900-no/moto_0441.jpg" alt="PotHix usando a mascara do Darth Vader" title="Darth Vader!"></a></p>
<p>Nenhum dos contratempos pode nos barrar muito! Com o calor vieram os
ventiladores, com a falta de energia veio o nosso local de trabalho
provisório (só durante aquele dia), e o prazo curto nós conseguimos
vencer com muitas barrinhas de cereal e horas de trabalho.</p>
<p>Ahhh! É claro que no meio de toda a correria tinhamos que ter tambem o
nossos momentos de descontração, alem do nosso amigo Darth Vader que
aparecia na hora dos conflitos do merge… hehehe</p>
<p>Entre nossas descontrações (geralmente pouco antes de ir embora,
22:00h) tinhamos sessão violão e Sitar, ou momento Guitar Hero, ou
jogo de alvo + dardos, um pouco de tiro com o <a href="http://openarena.ws/" title="Open Arena!">Open Arena</a> entre
outras coisinhas.</p>
<p>Estavamos trabalhando com 2 Macs, 1 Windows e 1 Linux, portanto sempre
tinha as boas e velhas conversas sobre o melhor sistema operacional, que
é claro que o Linux é o melhor (haha, pelo menos aqui eu sou o root
para dizer isso… hehehe).</p>
<p>Enfim…Foi um projeto corrido, dormimos pouco, trabalhamos muito,
consideramos feriados e finais de semana como dias normais de
trabalho, mas…Como diria o <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/raltimari" title="Rubens Altimari">Rubens</a> (algo parecido com isso):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>É dos projetos mais difíceis que ficam as suas ótimas recordações</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Portanto, na minha humilde opinião, se você tiver a oportunidade de
entrar naquele projeto difícil com bons amigos, faça que vai valer a
pena! :)</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Bem lembrado pelo Nelson! Nós temos o nosso vídeo de
comemoração, quando terminavamos nossas features:</p>

            <description>Há um tempo já que eu deveria ter postado sobre o Ruby Inside Brasil, mas estou esvaziando aos poucos o meu Todo List e estou aproveitando a promoção que eles fizeram para liberar esse post tambem. :)
O Ruby Inside Brasil é a edição autorizada do Ruby Inside mantido pelo Peter Cooper. Uma ótima iniciativa para postar bom conteúdo em português.
A idéia inicial do projeto foi do Carlos Brando, que junto com vários outros colaboradores está contruindo o nome do Ruby Inside Brasil, e tem como idéia não apenas postar traduções dos conteúdos do Ruby Inside em inglês, mas tambem postar conteúdo próprio escritos por desenvolvedores brasileiros, cobrindo tudo que acontece relacionado a Rails e Ruby aqui Brasil!</description>

            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/rails-dreamhost/</link>

            <description>Estou fazendo um pequeno site em Rails e como tinha que mostrar o andamento para um colega, aproveitei para testar como seria o Deploy desse projeto na DreamHost ( mesmo sabendo que o provedor final não será lá ), e achei muito fácil de se fazer, portanto resolvi escrever um pouco sobre o processo. :D
Primeiramente, você precisa ter acesso SSH na sua conta. Se você ainda não tiver esse acesso apenas faça o seguinte procedimento:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Estou fazendo um pequeno site em Rails e como tinha que mostrar o
andamento para um colega, aproveitei para testar como seria o Deploy
desse projeto na DreamHost ( mesmo sabendo que o provedor final não
será lá ), e achei muito fácil de se fazer, portanto resolvi escrever
um pouco sobre o processo. :D</p>
<p>Primeiramente, você precisa ter acesso SSH na sua conta. Se você ainda
não tiver esse acesso apenas faça o seguinte procedimento:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acesse o menu <strong>Users &gt; Manage Users</strong></li>
<li>Clique em <strong>Edit</strong> no user que você vai usar para o acesso SSH</li>
<li>Marque a opção <strong>Shell account - allows SFTP/FTP plus ssh access.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A partir daí você pode acessar por SSH assim como acessava por FTP,
com esse usuário e senha. :)</p>
<p>Agora que temos acesso SSH a conta, vamos colocar nossa aplicação lá!
Se ela estiver no GitHub você pode fazer um clone da sua aplicação
facilmente:</p>
<pre><code>git@github.com:usuario/projeto-qualquer.git
</code></pre>
<p>Se não estiver no GitHub você pode fazer um pacote tar.gz e enviar
facilmente por scp:</p>
<pre><code>tar cvf app.tar.gz aplicacao-quaquer/
scp usuario@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/home/local/da/applicacao app.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>*Sendo que o xxx é o endereço IP ou Nome da sua maquina na Dreamhost</p>
<p>Com nossa aplicaçào lá, vamos criar o nosso domínio ou sub-domínio no
<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/" title="Painel de controle da Dreamhost">painel de controle da DreamHost</a>,
pelo menu <strong>domains &gt; manage domains</strong>.</p>
<p>Geralmente seu domínio demora um pouco para começar a funcionar, mas
você não precisa esperar que ele esteja totalmente funcional para que
você continue o processo ;)</p>
<p>O que você precisa fazer é:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ativar o <strong>Ruby on Rails Passenger (mod_rails)</strong></li>
<li>Apontar o <strong>Specify your web directory</strong> para o diretório public da sua aplicação</li>
</ul>
<p>Agora que temos o nosso domínio criado e validando ( lembre-se que não
é instantâneo ), podemos configurar o nosso banco de dados!</p>
<p>Acesse o <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.mysql&amp;" title="Manage Mysql">Manage Mysql</a>
pelo menu <strong>Goodies &gt; Manage Mysql</strong> e preencha o formulário que
está logo abaixo dos bancos de dados já existente ( se houver ) para
criar um novo banco.</p>
<p>Com o novo banco de dados criado, vamos adaptar nossa aplicação para
usá-lo! ;)</p>
<p>Vá no arquivo <code>config/database.yml</code> e altere as informações da seção
<em>production</em> para o que foi configurado no painel..</p>
<p>Agora com tudo configurado, vamos rodas as nossas migrations para as
configurações de produção:</p>
<pre><code>RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
</code></pre>
<p>Com isso você já terá seu projeto funcionando assim que o domínio se
propagar!</p>
<p>Foi bem mais simples do que eu pensava, como eu deixei o repositório
com Git lá, basta eu fazer as alterações localmente e dar um push que
já terei minha aplicação alterada lá! :)</p>
<p>É isso aí, espero que seja útil para vocês.</p>

            <description>Fui ao show do Iron maiden nesse domingo dia 15/03 e resolvi postar as minhas considerações.
O show do Iron Maiden em si foi muito legal! Tocaram muitos clássicos como:
 Fear of the dark ( der&amp;hellip; ) Wasted Years Aces High The rime of ancient mariner Phanton of the Opera Hallowed be the name 666 the number of the beast The trooper  entre outras!
A abertura com o discurso de Winston Churchill e já entrando com Aces High foi muito legal!</description>

clássicos como:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of the dark ( der&hellip; )</li>
<li>Wasted Years</li>

</ul>
<p>entre outras!</p>
<p>A abertura com o discurso de Winston Churchill e já entrando com Aces
High foi muito legal! Há tempos que ouço essa musica e pensava:
&ldquo;Puxa&hellip;Isso ao vivo deve ser muito bom!&rdquo; e realmente foi!</p>
<p>Uma pena o show ter sido tão mal organizado&hellip;Nota 0 para a organização do evento que pecou em muuuuitas coisas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organização na entrada</li>
<li>Somente uma saída com um portão de 3 metros mais ou menos para a saída de 60 mil pessoas</li>
<li>Atraso de uma hora no show ( por causa da chuva, que não tem nada a ver comigo )</li>
<li>Sem proteção contra a chuva que danificou alguns equipamentos</li>
<li>Tinham onibus, mas eles nunca paravam pois já estavam lotados</li>
</ul>
<p>Teve um outro ponto ruim, que foi o show da filha do Steve Harris, que
ninguem estava se importando&hellip;O Guitarrista até que toca bem, mas o
som da banda é chato, e ninguem foi lá para ouvir ela, portanto foi só
apurrinhação&hellip;:P</p>
<p>A chuva ainda ajudou para alem de nos deixar molhados na fila, ainda
deixou o autódromo de interlagos transformado num grande pântano de
lama.</p>
<p>Mas é claro que todos esses contratempos foram aproveitados por
alguns, que aproveitaram a lama para fazer um escorregador improvisado
no morro para se jogar (hahaha) o que foi muito engraçado!</p>
<p>Muitas pessoas resolveram pular as divisórias e subir o barranco para
usar como arquibancada. o que foi bem bizarro de se ver tambem. Até
que desistiram de pular e destruiram as divisórias para passar para o
barranco, juntando centenas de pessoas no barranco, inclusive um doido
que estava em cima de uma árvore (!!!) assistindo o show.</p>
<p>Muitos comentários do tipo: &ldquo;Woodstock?&rdquo; estavam rolando&hellip;Lama, bom
som, destruição&hellip;hahahaha</p>
<p>Outra coisa que senti falta foi a pancadaria sadia e divertida que
sempre tem&hellip;Mas acho que tinha idades bem divergentes por lá, desde
crianças até pessoas de cabelo branco, portanto foi mais calmo (
droga&hellip; ).</p>
<p>Na volta para casa acabei sendo assaltado, mas o drogado apenas levou
20 reias e meu bilhete único (sem créditos), que não foi uma perda
muito grande, mas meus primos que estavam comigo perderam  os
celulares&hellip;:(</p>
<p>Nunca se sabe quando esses nóias estarão armados&hellip; E decidi não
reagir&hellip;</p>
<p>Bem&hellip; Relevando tudo isso&hellip; O show foi bem legal, e gostei de poder
ver o Iron aqui no Brasil! :D</p>

            <title>Curso de verão da USP</title>

            <description>Com o fim do curso de verão de 2009 da USP, resolvi postar minhas impressões sobre o mesmo!
O curso realmente foi muito bom e me ensinou muita coisa! Eu já tinha feito o curso no ano retrasado, mas não cheguei a terminar, por que o professor da época era muito foda e assumia que todos os alunos já sabiam do que ele estava falando, e para mim não significava tanto assim, portanto chegou um momento que eu simplesmente já não estava entendendo mais nada, e o professor já estava jogando matéria loucamente, portanto abandonei.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/images/posts/curso_verao_ime.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/curso_verao_ime.jpg" alt="Foto da grama escrito IME-USP" title="IME-USP"></a></p>
<p>Com o fim do curso de verão de 2009 da USP, resolvi postar minhas
impressões sobre o mesmo!</p>
<p>O curso realmente foi muito bom e me ensinou muita coisa! Eu já tinha
feito o curso no ano retrasado, mas não cheguei a terminar, por que o
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~rbrito/" title="Rogério Brito">professor da época</a>
era muito foda e assumia que todos os alunos já sabiam do que ele
estava falando, e para mim não significava tanto assim, portanto
chegou um momento que eu simplesmente já não estava entendendo mais
nada, e o professor já estava jogando matéria loucamente, portanto
abandonei.</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/curso_verao_intruders.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/curso_verao_intruders.jpg" alt="Fotos das nossas duas motos em frente ao IME" title="Nossas motos em frente ao IME"></a></p>
<p>Esse ano, assim como no ano retrasado, não fui sozinho. o Rodrigo foi
comigo também, apenas de ele não cursar algo relacionado a programação
(cursa redes), ele resolveu fazer o curso. Lá também encontrei a
Suelen, que participou do curso no ano retrasado também! Tudo isso sem
contar que ainda reencontrei outras pessoas que fizeram o curso junto
comigo em 2006, e que resolveram aparecer agora. :D</p>
<p>Esse ano tivemos um professor muito gente fina chamado
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~wander/" title="Página do Wander">Wanderley Guimarães</a> que
explicou a matéria muito bem durante todo o curso, ensinando até
coisas que não faziam parte do curso para quem não entendia o
suficiente, e indo além do que o curso previa para quem sabia muito
mais do que o normal. O professor é realmente muito legal, e a aula
realmente se tornava bem divertida de ser assistida, pois sempre
tínhamos certeza que viria um conteúdo interessante além dele estar
sempre disposto a conversar no final da aula.</p>
<p>O que foi abordado no curso:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Iteração, indução e recursão</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prova de invariantes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Análise de tempo de execução de algoritmo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vetores</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listas encadeadas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pilha e Fila</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buscas simples e busca binária</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordenação</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insertion Sort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selection Sort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge Sort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heap Sort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick Sort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Árvore Binária</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Árvore Binária de Busca</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No final do curso ainda tivemos uma introdução a Programação Dinâmica
e a algoritmos de enumeração! :)</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/curso_verao_wanderley.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/curso_verao_wanderley.jpg" alt="Foto do professor Wanderley Guimarães dando aula" title="Wanderley Guimarães"></a></p>
<p>A cada tópico passado tínhamos um estudo utilizando os outros tópicos
já aprendidos. Exemplo: Vamos estudar o MergeSort, então provamos as
invariantes / indução, fazemos ele tanto recursivo quanto iterativo,
vemos a quantidade de tempo e memória que o algoritmo utiliza e outras
coisas mais.</p>
<p>As aulas se tornaram bastante interativas pois o Wanderley sempre dava
bastante liberdade para a classe intagir com o conteúdo, as vezes até
propondo algoritmos interessantes &ldquo;On the fly&rdquo; na aula. :D</p>
<p>O curso é baseado em 2 provas e um EP (exercício programa) para
avaliação. Eu não fui muito bem na primeira prova, e espero ter me
saído razoável na segunda, e empenhei uma boa parte do meu tempo
noturno no EP para ver se no fim das contas eu ainda consigo sair com
o certificado. ;)</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/curso_verao_intruder.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/posts/curso_verao_intruder.jpg" alt="Foto de uma intruder sozinha em frente ao IME" title="Minha moto sozinha"></a></p>
<p>Como é de praxe, no final do curso tínhamos menos da metade da sala
com participantes ativos, pois muitos não se adéquam ao curso ou acham
muito difícil e desistem. Nesse momento do curso o Rodrigo já não
estava indo mais (o que eu já tinha previsto, não sei por que, e aí
está a foto com minha moto sozinha em frente ao prédio do IME), e eu
permaneci aprendendo tudo o que eu podia antes do fim do curso, mesmo
que minhas notas não estivessem como eu gostaria. :P</p>
<p>O EP desse ano foi bem interessante, deveríamos receber uma quantidade
indeterminada de palavras, sendo que elas seriam informadas uma por
linha pela entrada padrão, e o programa deveria imprimir todas as
palavras que eram anagramas umas das outras na mesma linha, e as que
não eram anagramas na linha seguinte&hellip; Algo como:</p>
<pre><code>teste
marrocos
futebol
pothix
bolfute
eetts
socorram
</code></pre><p>Ia retornar:</p>
<pre><code>teste eetts
marrocos socorram
pothix
futebol bolfute
</code></pre><p>A princípio parece fácil, mas quando você começa a fazer percebe que
não é tão simples assim. ;)</p>
<p>Só uma dica&hellip;Dá para fazer com lista encadeada. ^^</p>
<p>Espero sair com o certificado desse curso, pois me empenhei o máximo
que pude, mesmo com todos os transtornos que aconteceram, e com a
terrível falta de tempo. Mesmo querendo sair com o certificado, ele
não é o mais importante do curso, o que mais importa é a quantidade de
conhecimentos que eu consegui agregar, a quantidade de pessoas
interessantes que eu conheci, e a quantidade de experiência que isso
me trouxe. :D</p>
<p>Pretendo fazer vários posts sobre os conceitos que eu aprendi no curso
por que eu acho que será bem interessante passar esse conhecimento
para outras pessoas.</p>
<p>Eu tenho uma recomendação&hellip;Aproveite suas férias de janeiro do ano
que vem e vá fazer um curso de verão! ;)</p>

            <description>Hoje finalmente estou conseguindo escrever um post sobre o DC++! Desde a Campus Party eu quero escrever esse post mas nunca consigo tempo!
Para quem não conhece, o DC++ é um software para compartilhamento de arquivos, muito interessante, onde você pode facilmente compartilhar arquivos pela rede local, e por isso mesmo que foi muito utilizado na Campus Party, onde os campuseiros compartilharam terabytes e mais terabytes de arquivos!
Atualmente estou utilizando Ubuntu no meu notebook (não tenho mais PC nem em casa e nem no trampo, portanto o meu Slackware se foi&amp;hellip;:() e vou mostrar aqui como instalar o seu DC++ nele!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hoje finalmente estou conseguindo escrever um post sobre o DC++! Desde
a <a href="http://pothix.com/blog/events/campus-party-2009" title="Campus Party">Campus Party</a>
eu quero escrever esse post mas nunca consigo tempo!</p>
<p>Para quem não conhece, o
<a href="http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/" title="DC++ Official page on SourceForge">DC++</a>
é um software para compartilhamento de arquivos, muito interessante,
onde você pode facilmente compartilhar arquivos pela rede local, e por
isso mesmo que foi muito utilizado na Campus Party, onde os
campuseiros compartilharam terabytes e mais terabytes de arquivos!</p>
<p>Atualmente estou utilizando Ubuntu no meu notebook (não tenho mais PC
nem em casa e nem no trampo, portanto o meu Slackware se foi&hellip;:() e
vou mostrar aqui como instalar o seu DC++ nele!</p>
<p>Primeiramente vamos instalar as dependencias:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install bzr scons build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libglade2-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libssl-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Como é possível notar acima, estamos instalando tambem o
<a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/" title="Bazaar version control">Bazaar</a>, que é o
software de controle de versão que o DC++ utiliza, infelizmente ainda
não tem os binarios para nenhuma distribuição por que ele ainda está
em alpha, por isso temos que fazer o download direto pelo Bazaar!</p>
<pre><code>bzr branch lp:linuxdcpp
</code></pre>
<p>Agora temos um branch local do DC++ no nosso computador, portanto é só
entrar na pasta e instalar:</p>
<pre><code>cd linuxdcpp
scons release=1 PREFIX=/usr/local
sudo scons install
</code></pre>
<p>Veja que criei um &ldquo;PREFIX&rdquo; para instalar em /usr/local. =)</p>
<p>Agora seu DC++ já está instalado e você pode executar ele usando o
comando:</p>
<pre><code>linuxdcpp
</code></pre>
<p>E pronto!</p>
<p>Agora é só clicar no botão connect e conectar ao endereço de
compartilhamento e já era! :)</p>
<p>No <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=193984" title="How to install DC++ on Ubuntu">site que tirei essas dicas</a>
eles falam que é bom desabilitar o &ldquo;Assistive Technology Support&rdquo; por
que deixa o DC++ muito lento. É só ir em: <strong>Sistema &gt; Preferencias &gt; ATS</strong></p>
<p>Espero que seja útil para vocês assim como foi para mim no Campus
Party!</p>

            <description>Hoje o dia foi $#&amp;amp;&amp;amp;!

Atualmente moro em Diadema (que não é uma cidade ruim como muitos ouvem falar), e tenho o azer de morar próximo a um córrego, que a prefeitura promete canalizar há mais de 10 anos, e agora parece que finalmente o projeto começou a andar, mas enquanto o projeto não é concluído de vez a coisa ficou pior que o normal&amp;hellip;
No momento ruim eu tirei algumas fotos (o que sempre faço nesses casos) para mostrar a situação da coisa&amp;hellip;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hoje o dia foi $#&amp;&amp;!</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/+WillianMolinari/albums/5300186538520936977?banner=pwa" title=""><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-o-d1Cuoqs4U/SY4LyeeCslI/AAAAAAAABSk/h8ZKw09LENY/w1200-h900-no/S7301819.JPG" alt="Foto da minha garagem cheia de água de enchente" title="Água de enchente"></a></p>
<p>Atualmente moro em Diadema (que não é uma cidade ruim como muitos
ouvem falar), e tenho o azer de morar próximo a um córrego, que a
prefeitura promete canalizar há mais de 10 anos, e agora parece que
finalmente o projeto começou a andar, mas enquanto o projeto não é
concluído de vez a coisa ficou pior que o normal&hellip;</p>
<p>No momento ruim eu tirei <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090207Enchente?feat=directlink" title="Fotos da enchente maldita">algumas fotos</a> (o que sempre faço nesses casos) para
mostrar a situação da coisa&hellip;</p>
<p>Pois é&hellip; Já tivemos coisas bem piores que essa no passado, mas a
situação é muito ruim independente do quão grande for a desgraça.</p>
<p>Hoje para tudo calhou para dar errado e deixar minha cabeça
doendo&hellip; Foi como um &ldquo;efeito coringa&rdquo;, que diz que você pode ficar
doido igual o coringa se tudo de ruim acontecer com você de uma hora
para a outra.</p>
<p>Estava eu estudando algoritmo para fazer o meu EP (exercício programa
) do curso de verão, quando o tempo começa a fechar ( ou seja&hellip;Muitos
relâmpagos e computador desligado, pois já tive muita coisa queimada
por causa de raio ) o que já me deixa em alerta para muita coisa, e
meus pais tinham saído.</p>
<p>Pois bem&hellip;A chuva forte começa, e junto com ela os relampagos que eu
tinha previsto, e quando eu vi como a chuva estava caindo já me toquei
que ia dar problema! Quando vou ligar para o meu pai ex-Sysadmin do
meu ex-trampo me liga dizendo que o nosso ex-chefe ligou dizendo que o
site está fora do ar, e ele está na estrada nesse momento e não tem
como ver.</p>
<p>Situação ótima&hellip;. Preparar comportas para segurar a enchente, um
carro na garagem que precisa ser retirado, relampagos ameaçando o meu
computador a cada momento, 3 servidores virtualizados fora do
ar&hellip; Hora de correr.</p>
<p>Aos poucos fui contendo a situação&hellip; Meu pai chegou e tirou o carro
enquanto eu fui arrumando a comporta, depois corri para ver os
servidores (com a ajuda do SysAdmin por telefone), e enquanto
iniciava alguns serviços eu corria lá embaixo para ver como estava a
situação para tentar ajudar em alguma coisa.</p>
<p>No fim das contas temos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uma rua lotada de lama, que a prefeitura simplesmente ignora</li>
<li>3 servidores no ar novamente e o site funcionando (graças ao SysAdmin, claro!)</li>
<li>Felizmente tudo em ordem e nada queimou (como da ultima vez que perdi uma placa mãe, telefone, modem e outras coisas)</li>
<li>Um cara totalmente stressado e mal humorado (eu)</li>
</ul>
<p>Essa confusão toda (principalmente a enchente) me deixa muito mal
humorado, e o pior de tudo é saber que não posso fazer nada a
respeito.</p>
<p>O que tentei fazer foi mandar um
<a href="http://www.diadema.sp.gov.br/apache2-default/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=29" title="Página com os contatos da prefeitura">e-mail</a>
para a prefeitura de Diadema perguntando se eles ao menos podem &ldquo;fazer
o favor&rdquo; de mandar algo/alguem para limpar a rua após as enchentes até
que o projeto que supostamente resolverá os nossos problemas com as
enchentes esteja terminado.</p>
<p>Agora o que posso fazer é aguardar uma resposta deles ( se é que vão
responder ) e seguir rumo&hellip;</p>

            <description>Boas novas!
Eu tinha feito um post sobre os usuários dos serviços da VIVO que tiveram que desenvolver uma extensão para conseguir acessar os serviços do Vivo on line, e agora a vivo anunciou oficialmente em seu blog que o Vivo on line funcionará bem em outros navegadores diferentes de Internet Explorer! :)
Tudo bem que isso é um direito nosso e já deveria funcionar em todos desde o começo do serviço, pois prejudicava os usuários de outros sistemas operacionais diferentes do Windows, mas temos que parabenizar a VIVO por trabalhar em cima do problema que tinham e resolver assim como prometeram em novembro do ano passado!</description>

            <description>Como sabem eu estive na Campus Party nessa ultima semana, e consegui aproveitar bastante do evento, apesar do monte de coisas que estão acontecendo na minha vida e a correria toda de trabalho, curso e outras coisas.
Segue um pequeno resumo do que pude ver por lá:
Segunda-feira dia 19/01/2009 Cheguei no evento mais ou menos as 15:00 e consegui entrar rapidinho&amp;hellip; Já armei a minha barraca (vide fotos) e deixei algumas coisas por lá para não ficar carregando, e fui conectar na internet que ainda estava bem precária que só funcionava em algumas mesas.</description>

<p>Segue um pequeno resumo do que pude ver por lá:</p>
<h3 id="segunda-feira-dia-19012009">Segunda-feira dia 19/01/2009</h3>
<p>Cheguei no evento mais ou menos as 15:00 e consegui entrar
rapidinho&hellip; Já armei a minha barraca
(<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090119Cparty?feat=directlink" title="Fotos do dia na Campus Party">vide fotos</a>)
e deixei algumas coisas por lá para não ficar carregando, e fui
conectar na internet que ainda estava bem precária que só funcionava
em algumas mesas. Fiquei pouco tempo acessando a internet, pois tive
que fazer a minha peregrinação diária de ir para a USP para fazer o
curso de verão de tópicos de programação.</p>
<p>Voltando do curso (mais ou menos 23:00), após passar em casa volto
para cá para ver como estão as coisas, e ainda consegui ver a abertura
do evento, com direito a Serra, Kassab e o

<p>Após todas as festividades fiquei esperando as primeiras atividades
que supostamente começariam 1:00, mas não vi nada de diferente e
continuei na minha mesa até umas 2:30 mais ou menos quando resolvi me
recolher para a minha barraca e dormir.</p>

<h3 id="terça-feira-dia-20012009">Terça-feira dia 20/01/2009</h3>
<p>Acordei as 8 da manhã para ver a palestra do Fabio Akita sobre
ecossistema RubyOnRails e até fui mencionado por ele quando ele falou
sobre o <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class/" title="Rubylearning">Rubylearning</a>
(obrigado Akita!). Foi uma palestra bem legal falando dos mitos do
Rails, mostrando um pouco de código e tudo mais&hellip;para quem não
conhece o Rails foi uma geral bem legal.</p>
<p>Depois da palestra fui conversar com o Fabio e ficamos um bom tempo
batendo papo enquanto conhecia a equipe da Locaweb ( inclusive o
<a href="http://twitter.com/locaweb_reply" title="Locaweb Reply">@locaweb_reply</a> !
haha ). O pessoal da Locaweb estava com uma camiseta bem legal com os
dizeres:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1F U C4N R34D 7H15 U N33D 70 G37 4 L41D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tentei de toda forma ganhar uma, até por que era a camiseta de Linux
da Locaweb, mas no fim das contas não consegui e fiquei somente com
uma revista mesmo.</p>
<p>Consegui começar a aproveitar a internet, fazer uns downloads e ver
uns vídeos! :)</p>
<p>Depois comecei a procurar (ou não) e encontrar uma galera legal, como o
<a href="http://guru-sp.com/index.php/Usu%C3%A1rio:Agaelebe" title="Hugo Borges">agaelebe</a>
e o <a href="http://rinaldi-rinaldi.info/" title="Mario Rinaldi">Mario Rinaldi</a>
da fundação Mozilla no Brasil.</p>
<p>Sai na hora do almoço e fui para casa (sim, estou almoçando e tomando
banho em casa, já que moro perto daqui, então estou apenas dormindo
aqui por diversão), quando voltei ja era 16:00, e ainda consegui
assistir a apresentação sobre Podcasts com
<a href="http://www.maestrobilly.com/podcast/" title="Maestro Billy">Maestro Billy</a>,
<a href="http://mellancia.com.br/site_2007/" title="Mellancia">Mellancia</a>,
<a href="http://www.nerdcast.com.br" title="">Jovem Nerd, Azaghal</a>,
<a href="http://idgnow.uol.com.br/podcast/" title="Now café e Podcast IDGNOW">Dani Brau e Guilherme Felliti</a>,
que por sinal foi bem interessante! No final ainda consegui tirar uma
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/izJmVmftCJw3tdBZqLkrKw?feat=directlink" title="Foto com o Jovem Nerd">foto com o Alottoni</a>
e <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/eLcO0OybfKq1v_C6EEGo3w?feat=directlink" title="Foto com o Azaghal">uma com o Azaghal</a>
( e nessas fotos estou comprovando que não sei sorrir. :))</p>
<p>Ahhh! Outra coisa legal que consegui foi além de conhecer o Karlisson,
ainda consegui <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bSUO6-VY709-pVsCG9qPBA?feat=directlink" title="Foto com o Karlisson">tirar uma foto</a>
com a celebridade criadora do <a href="http://www.nerdson.com" title="Nerdson">nerdson.</a></p>
<p>Encontrei tambem meio que de passagem a
<a href="http://griebeler.com/" title="Griebeler">Bruna Griebeler</a> quando eu estava
chegando e ela saindo&hellip;Deu para conversar bastante ainda com o pouco
tempo que tinha. :)</p>
<p>Chegando aqui tarde novamente, percebi que perdi a palestra sobre
desenvolvimento de games com C++, que é uma das coisas que estou
estudando&hellip; Tive 2 notícias, uma boa e outra ruim&hellip; A boa era que iam
ter palestras de desenvolvimento de games a semana toda! (uhuuu) e a
notícia ruim é que cai no horário do curso de verão (duuuhhh),
portanto não vou conseguir assistir nenhuma.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090120Cparty?feat=directlink" title="Fotos do segundo dia">Veja aqui as fotos do dia</a></em></p>
<h3 id="quarta-feira-dia-21012009">Quarta-feira dia 21/01/2009</h3>
<p>Peguei um HD externo de 40Gb para fazer download de umas coisas para
um colega meu, e descobri o
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=193984" title="DC++">DC++</a> que o
pessoal estava usando aqui internamente, o que deixa o
compartilhamento de arquivos com uma velocidade monstruosa, e comecei
a encher o meu HD que estava com 160GBs livres ( fora o HD externo de
40 ).</p>
<p>Assisti uma palestra sobre SEO, que foi bem interessante apensar do
som que estava horrível de ouvir por causa dos outros sons que estavam
em volta e o volume do som dessa area que estava muito baixo.</p>
<p>Assisti a palestra do Luciano Ramalho ( presidente da
<a href="http://associacao.pythonbrasil.org/" title="Associação Python Brasil">associação Python Brasil</a>)
sobre Python (obviamente), que apesar de alguns problemas
com o projetor, foi interessante e mostrou várias coisas
diferentes. Após a palestra ainda consegui conversar com o Luciano um
pouco (já fiz um curso de Python ministrado por ele na Impacta).</p>
<p>Assisti a ótima palestra do Manoel Lemos do
<a href="http://blogblogs.com.br/" title="BlogBlogs">Blogblogs</a>, que falou sobre a
infra-estrutura do blogblogs e do Brasigo (
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090121Cparty?feat=directlink" title="Link das fotos">vide fotos</a>),
que foi crescendo aos poucos, assim mostrando um
case de sucesso que começou simples e aos poucos foi crescendo com
inteligencia. Na minha opinião essa palestra é ótima para
desenvolvedores Rails (e não Rails também) que tem aplicações que
podem crescer rápidamente e precisar de uma mudança de estrutura para
continuar prestando um bom serviço.</p>
<p>No final da palestra apareceu um slide dizendo &ldquo;estamos contratando
novos Jedis&rdquo;! Isso muito me interessa! ;)</p>
<p>Assisti no CPLabs uma apresentação sobre o OpenVC, que é uma
biblioteca C++ para trabalhar com webcam, que é muito interessante! Dá
para captar movimentos e fazer várias coisas divertidas! Na palestra
foram apresentados vários vídeos legais.</p>
<p>O mais legal do dia foi ter cumprimentado e tirado</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bwqkuJOFim3eswuZFNUnPw?feat=directlink">uma foto com nada mais nada menos que John &ldquo;Maddog&rdquo; Hall</a>!!
Sim, ele mesmo, o  do software livre e diretor executivo da Linux International!</p>
<p>Finalmente hoje encontrei a <a href="http://griebeler.com/" title="Griebeler">Bruna Griebeler</a>
novamente, mas como sempre na saída de um dos dois, mas dessa vez er a
minha (estava saindo para almoçar em casa), mas após ficar batendo
papo, aproveitamos para fazer inscrição para ganhar um <a href="http://willianmolinari.com" title="Novo domínio do PotHix">domínio
grátis</a> por um
ano no stand do IG! E acabei indo almoçar as 16&hellip;.hahaha</p>
<p>Após voltar do curso da USP, tive que começar a me focar nos
exercícios para entregar na quinta feira (sim&hellip;é amanhã), portanto
fiquei até as 3 da manhã trabalhando nisso, e só não fiquei mais por
que estava muuuuiiitooo frio, portanto preferi ir para a minha barraca
quentinha. :P</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090121Cparty?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="/images/posts/campus_party_day3.jpg" alt="Foto das mesas com e pessoal sentado usando os computadores" title="Campus party"></a></p>

<h3 id="quinta-feira-dia-22012009">Quinta-feira dia 22/01/2009</h3>
<p>Acordei um pouco mais tarde e tirei o dia para mexer nos exercícios,
portanto fiquei pouco na Campus Party.</p>
<p>Hoje, além do Mario Rinaldi que resolveu aparecer novamente (ele tem
o poder de desaparecer&hellip; hahha ), o
<a href="http://guru-sp.com/index.php/Usu%C3%A1rio:Admin" title="Marcelo Castellani">Marcelo Castellani</a>
do <a href="http://guru-sp.org" title="Guru-SP">guru-sp</a> apareceu por
aqui também, o que rendeu a
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090122Cparty?feat=directlink" title="Castellani ali na direita">única foto do dia com uma qualidade horrível</a>.</p>
<p>Conversando com o Rinaldi eu consegui pegar a minha camiseta do
<a href="http://getfirefox.com/" title="Mozilla Firefox Browser">Mozilla Firefox</a> (
melhor navegador do mundo! haaha ), e de quebra conheci outro cara da
fundação Mozilla, que é o Bruno Magrini! :)</p>
<p>Depois disso tive que resolver uns problemas e terminar uns exercícios
em casa para ir para USP.</p>
<p>Depois de resolver mais problemas volto ao campus party para escrever
no blog até as 5 da manhã, estudar C para a USP (por que tenho prova
na segunda feira) e baixar trecos legais! :)</p>

<h3 id="sexta-feira-dia-23012009">Sexta-feira dia 23/01/2009</h3>
<p>Sexta feira foi um dia legal por aqui! já menos preocupado com a lista
de exercícios (mas preocupado com a prova de segunda), eu consegui
fazer bastante coisa, conversar com várias pessoas, e tudo mais.</p>
<p>Encontrei o pessoal do <a href="http://guanabara.info" title="Guanabara.info">Guanabara.info</a>!</p>
<p>Conversamos com o Gustavo Guanabara, demos uma volta pela feira, vimos
como são feitas as pautas do
<a href="http://www.guanabara.info/?cat=1138" title="Podcast
Guanabara.info">Podcast</a>, conhecemos o
<a href="http://www.hostnet.com.br/" title="Hostnet">Kaue Linden da HostNet</a>
(que por sinal é muito gente boa!), ganhei uma camiseita do
Guanabara.info e uns adesivos!  Foi bem divertido encontrar essa
galera e conhecer o Guanabara pessoalmente. :)</p>
<p>No fim das contas ainda fiquei pouco tempo por aqui (das 19:00 as
22:00), mas valeu a pena!</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090123Cparty?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="/images/posts/campus_party_guanabara.jpg" alt="PotHix e gustavo guanabara" title="PotHix e Gustavo Guanabara"></a></p>

<h3 id="sábado--dia-24012009"><strong>Sábado  dia 24/01/2009</strong></h3>
<p>Após ficar até as 4 da manhã estudando na casa de um amigo, durmi um pouco e vim direto para cá! :)</p>
<p>Encontrei o <a href="http://guru-sp.com/index.php/Usu%C3%A1rio:Admin" title="Marcelo Castellani">Marcelo Castellani do guru-sp</a>,
e ficamos um bom tempo batendo papo com o <a href="http://akitaonrails.com" title="AkitaOnRails">Fabio Akita</a>,
e isso se tornou o segundo encontro do guru-sp ( que estava marcado aqui na Campus Party)! :)</p>
<p>Após as conversas eu peguei minha camiseta do Guru-sp com o Marcelo e
fiquei com as camisetas do pessoal que talvez iria aparecer por aqui,
e consegui entregar uma para o
<a href="http://blog.shadowmaru.org/" title="Ricardo Yasuda">Ricardo Yasuda ( Shadow11)</a>.</p>
<p>Assisti um pedaço da palestra do Karlisson sobre quadrinhos, onde ele
mostrou algumas particularidades das imagens, e fez uma tirinha
durante a palestra ( infelizmente cheguei tarde para ver essa parte ).</p>
<p>Assisti um pedaço da palestra sobre app engine do pessoal do
<a href="http://www.pythonbrasil.com.br/moin.cgi/GrupySP" title="Grupo de usuários Python de São Paulo">GruPy</a>,
que foi bem interessante! Eles trouxeram palestrantes internacionais
para falar sobre app engine, e o assunto foi bem legal para quem não
conhece o app, está afim de brincar com Python e quer uma boa
estrutura para deixar sua aplicação gratuitamente! :)</p>
<p>E teve várias outras palestras legais que eu gostaria de assistir, mas
infelizmente eu só posso estar em um lugar ao mesmo tempo ( acho que
eu preciso da filosofia &ldquo;Fork you&rdquo; do GitHub&hellip;haha ), portanto não
pude assistir outras como a de Desenvolvimento de games com C++&hellip;</p>
<p>Tinha planejado ir para casa e depois ir para a casa de um amigo
estudar a madrugada toda novamente, mas no fim das contas acabei
ficando na Campus Party mesmo por vários motivos, e foi bem divertido
ficar lá papeando e se divertindo com o Pessoal da
<a href="http://www.mozillabrasil.org/" title="Mozilla Brasil">Moz-br</a>
(Clauber-halic, <a href="http://griebeler.com/" title="Griebeler">Bruna Griebeler</a>,
Hermano Silva e <a href="http://rinaldi-rinaldi.info/">Mario Rinaldi</a>,
o <a href="http://nerdson.com" title="Nerdson não vai a escola">Karlisson</a>
e o <a href="http://infog.casoft.info/" title="InFog">InFog</a>
(<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090124Cparty?feat=directlink" title="Fotos">vejam nas fotos</a>).</p>
<p>Teve uma coisa que precisa ser comentada! Teve dois caras correndo
pela Campus Party nesse dia, um vestido de PacMan e o outro vestido de
fantasma com uma sirene! hahahaha! Parabens ao cara que pensou nisso,
por que foi muito criativo, pena que não tenho as fotos.</p>
<p>Desmontei minha barraca e saí de lá as 6 da manhã mais ou menos. ;)</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090124Cparty?feat=directlink" title=""><img src="/images/posts/campus_party_gurusp.jpg" alt="Akita, Castellani e PotHix" title="Akita, Castellani e PotHix"></a></p>

<h3 id="considerações-finais">Considerações finais</h3>
<p>A Campus Party para mim terminou no Sábado, mas domingo a area Expo
ainda estava aberta para visitas, mas resolvi não aparecer por lá já
que na area Expo não tinha muita coisa.</p>
<p>Gostei bastante do evento! Considerei como uma aventura, passar uma
semana dormindo fora ( durmindo pouquíssimo e sem horário certo hehe
), acessando a internet rapidíssima, comendo pouco, estudando, fazendo
networking e se divertindo!</p>
<p>Conheci muitas pessoas legais (e outras que pensei que fossem legais
e nem são), me diverti bastante, tirei fotos legais, preparei caminho
para o futuro ( se acontecer algo eu postarei ), baixei muita coisa (
200GB), gastei uma graninha com estacionamento e refeição e estou bem
mais tranquilo para voltar ao trabalho depois de uma semana fazendo
coisas que eu adoro (programar, conversar sobre tecnologia, acessar a
internet).</p>
<p>Tiveram coisas bem legais acontecendo por lá e outras que não foram
tão legais, mas é claro que todos os eventos tem seus defeitos, e esse
evento para mim foi muito bom!</p>
<p>No fim das contas&hellip;pretendo voltar lá ano que vem! :D</p>

            <description>Primeiramente quero parabenizar o Diogo Santos pelo seu add-on para Firefox, que faz com que o botão &amp;ldquo;entrar&amp;rdquo; do site da Vivo funcione sem que você tenha que usar javascript para manipular pela barra de endereços. Parabéns Diogo, é uma ótima contribuição para a comunidade.
Agora vem a hora da crítica&amp;hellip; Como que os usuários tem que ficar desenvolvendo formas alternativas para acessar os serviços que deveriam funcionar para eles, mas por descaso e serviço mal feito não lhe são concedidos?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Primeiramente quero parabenizar o
<a href="http://blog.diogosantos.com/2009/01/acesse-o-vivo-online-com-avoi-um-complemento-para-firefox/">Diogo Santos</a>
pelo seu <a href="http://diogosantos.com/avoi/" title="AVOI">add-on para Firefox</a>,
que faz com que o botão &ldquo;entrar&rdquo; do site da Vivo funcione sem que você
tenha que usar javascript para manipular pela barra de
endereços. Parabéns Diogo, é uma ótima contribuição para a comunidade.</p>
<p>Agora vem a hora da crítica&hellip; Como que os usuários tem que ficar
desenvolvendo formas alternativas para acessar os serviços que
deveriam funcionar para eles, mas por descaso e serviço mal feito não
lhe são concedidos? Eu acho impressionante o descaso de tais
operadoras por determinadas coisas.</p>
<p>O pior de tudo é que quando você entra em contato pelo suporte a
resposta que te dão é a seguinte:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Não damos suporte a outro navegador que não seja o Internet Explorer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ou seja&hellip; Caso você esteja no Linux ou no MacOs o problema é
seu&hellip; Eles não estão nem aí se estão simplesmente excluindo essas
pessoas.</p>
<p>A nossa sorte é que a comunidade é auto-suficiente, e temos pessoas
que trabalham a favor da comunidade (e não a favor da VIVO), sempre
ajudando para que os serviços mal feitos funcionem, e o Diogo é um
ótimo exemplo disso.</p>
<p>Após acessar o site da Vivo com o plugin do Diogo, eu percebi que
ainda tem vários serviços que ficam indisponíveis, mas quem sabe a
comunidade dá um jeito nisso com o tempo, ou até mesmo a VIVO toma
vergonha na cara e resolve prestar um serviço de internet de
qualidade.</p>
<p>Fica aí a minha crítica a
<a href="http://www.vivo.com.br" title="Site de má qualidade da VIVO">VIVO</a>
e a parabenização ao <a href="http://diogosantos.com/" title="Site do Diogo">Diogo</a>!</p>

            <description>Já está mais do que na hora de eu fazer um post sobre isso, e acho que não há momento mais propício do que esse afinal, até o Google já está dando alertassobre isso no Gmail. Sabemos que o Gmail é não é o serviço mais acessado do Google, mas isso já é uma grande ajuda para alertar os desavisados que esse navegador já passou da hora de deixar de existir, e quem sabe num futuro talvez distante ( espero que não tão distante assim ) o google resolva fazer algo parecido com o Orkut!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Já está mais do que na hora de eu fazer um post sobre isso, e acho que
não há momento mais propício do que esse afinal, até o Google já está
dando alertas<a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/html_tmp/content-view-40785-140.html" title="Google corta o suporte ao IE6 no Gmail">sobre isso no Gmail</a>.
Sabemos que o Gmail é não é o serviço mais acessado do Google, mas
isso já é uma grande ajuda para alertar os desavisados que esse
navegador já passou da hora de deixar de existir, e quem sabe num
futuro talvez distante ( espero que não tão distante assim ) o google
resolva fazer algo parecido com o Orkut! :)</p>
<p>Há muito na internet sobre o quanto o IE6 é ruim, e minha opinião não
difere muito da opinião dita em posts como o do
<a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2009/1/5/off-topic-abaixo-ie-6" title="Abaixo o IE6">Fabio Akita</a>,
ou do <a href="http://digitalpaperweb.com.br/ezine/development/campanha-pare-o-ie6" title="Campanha pare o IE6">Canha</a>
por exemplo ( O logo ao lado foi tirado do blog do
<a href="http://akitaonrails.com" title="AkitaOnRails">Fabio Akita</a> todos os
créditos para ele! ).</p>
<p>Muita gente que me conhece pode dizer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahhh&hellip;.vc não gosta da Microsoft e fica fazendo propaganda de browsers Open Source</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mas na verdade não é <strong>somente</strong> por isso&hellip;Mesmo que vc vá continuar
com o IE (não recomendado, mas menos mal), pelo menos atualize para
uma versão mais recente, pois usar o IE6 hoje em dia é completamente
inaceitável!</p>
<p>Alguns ainda tem a audácia de me perguntar o por que de eu ser contra
o IE6 e aqui vão alguns argumentos completamente lógicos para o fato:</p>
<ol>
<li>É um produto desatualizado que já tem uma versão mais nova lançada e outra no forno para sair sei lá quando</li>
<li>É um produto que foi lançado numa época em que ele precisava estar na <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" title="Veja a primeira guerra dos navegadores">frente para bater outros navegadores</a>, portanto não estava nem aí para padrões, bom desenvolvimento ou qualquer outra boa prática que pudesse existir.</li>
<li>Você que usa IE6 não sabe o mal que está fazendo para tantas pessoas que trabalham com internet e precisam perder preciosas horas do seu dia para ficar fazendo hacks para que seu site ( que segue os <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C" title="Leia aqui na Wikipedia">padrões de desenvolvimento para internet</a>, bem documentados <a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="World Wide Web Consortium">aqui</a> ) funcione num produto desatualizado que deveria ter sumido já.</li>
<li>Ele dá um grande break na evolução das tecnologias, pois muitas das coisas legais que os desenvolvedores querem fazer ( transparencia por exemplo precisa colocar Hack bizarro para funcionar no IE6 ) devem ser pensadas e repensadas, pois pode não funcionar legal no IE6, e seu chefe com certeza não vai deixar você colocar no ar algo que não funcione legal no IE6, por que ainda tem uma grande massa que usa isso.</li>
</ol>
<p>Já ouvi argumentos de pessoas que gostam do visual do IE6, que é
totalmente aceitável, afinal, qualquer pessoa pode usar o que acha
mais legal, bonito, fácil.,ou sei lá o que consideram, mas se for
somente por isso você pode seguir a
<a href="http://digitalpaperweb.com.br/ezine/development/campanha-pare-o-ie6" title="Tema do IE6 para o Firefox">dica que o canha deu no post dele</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No Firefox, inclusive há um <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/7944" title="">tema que se parece com o IE6</a> para você não se sentir perdido. E o melhor: todos estes navegadores possuem versão em português.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eu estou fazendo a minha parte para começar o ano bem e estou
instalando aqui no meu blog um plugin para alertar os usuários desse
software antigo para atualizar para algo melhor.</p>
<p>Não sabe como fazer? Veja aqui os links para instalar um browser diferente:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pt-br.www.mozilla.com/pt-BR/firefox/" title="Download do FIrefox">Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" title="Google Chrome">Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/" title="Site oficial do Opera">Opera</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/" title="Página de download do Safari">Safari</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/brasil/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx" title="Internet Explorer 7">Internet Explorer 7</a> (prefira os acima, mas se gostar mesmo do IE instala esse que é melhor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Acho que consegui dar motivos o suficiente para você trocar de
browser, se ainda tem alguma coisa que você usa não terá em outros
browsers, me avise que farei o possível para encontrarmos uma boa
solução para isso.</p>

I&rsquo;m just translating some informations that you can find
<a href="http://prodblog.locaweb.com.br/2008/11/11/suporte-a-merb-10-na-hospedagem-compartilhada-linux/" title="Merb on Linux Share Host (in portuguese )">here</a> in portuguese.</p>
<p>Lets get started! :D</p>
<p>First open the</p>
<p><a href="http://painel.locaweb.com.br/painel_controle/gerenciador_dominios.asp" title="Gerenciador de domínios">Domain Manager</a>
(gerenciador de domínios) on Locaweb Panel (painel da Locaweb) and
configure the pointer of your main site to other directory on
public_html of your account (this directory don&rsquo;t need to exist).</p>
<p>Follow this steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on &ldquo;alterar&rdquo; (change)</li>
<li>Change the &ldquo;Diretório Web&rdquo; (web directory) to the new diretory</li>
<li>And click on button &ldquo;Salvar&rdquo; (save)</li>
</ol>
<p>Transfer your application to this directory on your host. For this
example, lets say that your application is called &ldquo;sample_merb&rdquo;, so,
connect via SSH on your account and create the directory &ldquo;rack_app&rdquo;:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p rack_app/sample_merb
</code></pre>
<p>And move your application to there.</p>
<p>Your application must to have a file called &ldquo;config.ru&rdquo; to be executed
by Phusion Passenger, so, you need to create this file on your
application folder (rack_app/sample_merb on this case) with this
content:</p>
<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'merb-core'

Merb::Config.setup(:merb_root   =&gt; “.”, :environment =&gt;; ENV['RACK_ENV'])

Merb.environment = Merb::Config[:environment]
Merb.root = Merb::Config[:merb_root]
Merb::BootLoader.run
run Merb::Rack::Application.new
</code></pre>
<p>Now you need to create a symbolic link on your public_html diretory,
as you have configured on your Domain Manager (gerenciador de domínios)
of Locaweb Panel.</p>
<pre><code>ln -s ~/rack_app/sample_merb/public ~/public_html/sample_merb
</code></pre>
<p>By using this simple configuration you will have your application
pointed by apache with Phusion Passenger.</p>
<p>Just to you know, you can see the merb gems that are installed with:</p>
<pre><code>gem list | grep merb
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this help you on how to make your simple application works on Locaweb. ;)</p>

            <description>Estou apenas postando para dizer que nesse novo ano eu pretendo postar mais sobre programação! Essa é a primeira virada de ano desse blog, então resolvi postar meus &amp;ldquo;planos&amp;rdquo; para o próximo ano.
Como o blog é novo eu comecei a escrever faz pouco tempo e estou pegando experiência aos poucos, e talvez agora nesse novo ano a qualidade dos posts aumente! (ou não&amp;hellip;heheh).
Não sei bem qual rumo minha vida vai seguir nesse novo ano, o que eu vou ter que aprender e estudar, talvez eu tenha que aprender coisas que eu não tinha planejado e isso pode tomar uma boa parte do meu tempo, mas eu pretendo postar todos os meus estudos aqui, portanto terei algum material interessante aqui.</description>

            <description>Bem&amp;hellip;Estava eu aproveitando as férias (tanto da faculdade como as férias coletivas do trabalho) para colocar as coisas em ordem, começando pelo meu quarto que é o lugar da casa que eu passo mais tempo e eu gosto de manter bem organizado, portanto já tratei de aproveitar meu tempo livre para deixar ele do jeito que eu queria.
Comprei uma pequena estante para colocar mais livros e outras coisas legais, encaixotei várias coisas que eu quase nunca vou usar, e joguei 2 sacolas de papéis e outras coisas inúteis fora.</description>

férias coletivas do trabalho) para colocar as coisas em ordem,
começando pelo meu quarto que é o lugar da casa que eu passo mais

aproveitar meu tempo livre para deixar ele do jeito que eu queria.</p>
<p>Comprei uma pequena estante para colocar mais livros e outras coisas
legais, encaixotei várias coisas que eu quase nunca vou usar, e joguei
2 sacolas de papéis e outras coisas inúteis fora. Com isso tudo acabei
até achando 2 adesivos legais (um do Quake III e outro do Unreal
Tournament GotY) que eu tinha para colar no</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/a-tiDhsHv5pIkSce68oH7w?feat=directlink" title="Adesivo do Unreal Tournament">meu capacete</a>
e na <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tif9whzrOfu3PdnDx-DRfg?feat=directlink" title="Adesivo do Quake III">minha moto</a>. :)</p>
<p>No fim das contas finalmente consegui deixar o meu quarto como eu
queria:</p>

<p>Acho que consegue me descrever bastante:</p>
<p>Fora da mesa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violão e guitarra</li>
<li>Posters dos 3 filmes d&quot;O Senhor dos Anéis&quot;</li>
<li>Mochila preta</li>
</ul>
<p>Na mesa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vários porta cds com DVDs de arquivos e outras coisas mais</li>
<li>Um porta cd com alguns cds de musica como Metallica, Bach ( da coleção da folha se não me engano ) e outros.</li>
<li>Palm e teclado ao lado do monitor</li>
<li>Roteador Wireless</li>
<li>Pastinha do Google</li>
<li>Livro de C++</li>
</ul>
<p>Na estante:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peças e relógio de xadrez da Jaehrig</li>
<li>Tabuleiro de xadrez portátil</li>
<li>Mangás Sakura Card Captors (curto esse esquema de cartas)</li>
<li>Pasta com muitas cartas de Magic - the Gathering (na parte de baixo da estante)</li>
<li>PSP</li>
<li>Alguns livros: O senhor dos anéis - Edição completa, Universidade Hacker, Repensando a web com Rails, Servidores Unix&hellip;.</li>
<li>Várias revistas: Linux Magazine, Revista Locaweb, Revista WWW</li>

<li>Pastas de desenhos ( faz muito tempo que não desenho algo, mas fica a recordação de quando desenhava )</li>
<li>caderno e pasta da faculdade</li>
<li>Notebook</li>
</ul>
<p>Em cima da estante:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crachás dos eventos que eu participei (faltando alguns que se perderam)</li>
</ul>
<p>E aí que vem a parte que eu queria chegar!:D</p>
<p>Aqui é o maior concurso de todos os tempos, se você tem um quarto tão
nerd como o meu tire umas fotos dele e post aqui para eu ver, e quem
sabe você pode ganhar&hellip; humm&hellip;.. adivinhe&hellip;. SiiimmM!! Toda a honra e
a glória de ter um quarto mais nerd que o meu&hellip; E o meu respeito

            <description>Meu ultimo post foi sobre como subir um projeto para o GitHub, mas me veio agora uma vontade repentina de falar como deixar seu git legalzinho para começar a criar repositórios e contribuir com códigos! Serão apenas configurações básicas, mas que são bem úteis quando você estiver usando o Git ativamente!
Antes de mais nada precisamos instalar o Git, portanto é só baixar ele no repositório oficial e fazer a instalação referente ao seu sistema operacional.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meu ultimo post foi sobre como subir um projeto para o
<a href="http://github.com" title="">GitHub</a>, mas me veio agora uma vontade
repentina de falar como deixar seu git legalzinho para começar a criar
repositórios e contribuir com códigos! Serão apenas configurações
básicas, mas que são bem úteis quando você estiver usando o Git
ativamente!</p>
<p>Antes de mais nada precisamos instalar o Git, portanto é só baixar ele
no <a href="http://git.or.cz/#download">repositório oficial</a> e fazer a
instalação referente ao seu sistema operacional.</p>
<ul>
<li>No meu Slackware já veio o Git instalado belezinha, portanto foi moleza! No máximo eu atualizei com o SlackPkg.</li>
<li>No Ubuntu se eu não me engano eu precisei instalar, mas foi moleza, só baixar o .deb oficial e usar o dpkg -i :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Vamos as configurações:</p>
<p>Primeiramente precisamos de configurar o nosso nome e e-mail:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name &quot;PotHix&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;PotHix@pothix.com&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Algora alguns Alias para facilitar:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.br branch
</code></pre>
<p>Agora algumas cores para facilitar a leitura quando digitarmos os comandos:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global color.status auto
git config --global color.branch auto
git config --global color.diff auto
</code></pre>
<p>Podemos já criar um projeto simples e enviar para o
<a href="http://github.com" title="">GitHub</a> assim como eu fiz no
<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/git/iniciando-seu-primeiro-projeto-no-github" title="">post anterior</a>
mas agora já usando os nossos alias para ficar mais fácil! :)</p>
<p>Com Git podemos fazer várias outras coisas que vou falando aos poucos
em outros posts, esse aqui é só para mostrar como deixar seu git mais
legal para começar.</p>

            <title>Iniciando seu primeiro projeto no GitHub</title>

            <description>Hoje estou aqui para postar um pouco sobre o GitHub! =)
Minha idéia hoje é apenas mostrar como você inicia um projeto por lá, ou seja, enviar um pequeno repositório git e deixar no GitHub, e conforme os meus progressos eu postarei mais coisas por aqui! ; )
Antes de começar tudo isso você precisar ter cadastro no GitHub (obviamente) e já ter uma public-key cadastrada.
Para cadastrar uma public-key é só logar no GitHub, clicar em account (no canto superior direito) e clicar em &amp;ldquo;add public key&amp;rdquo; que vão aparecer os campos para inserir a mesma.</description>

<p>Minha idéia hoje é apenas mostrar como você inicia um projeto por lá,

<p>Antes de começar tudo isso você precisar ter cadastro no GitHub
(obviamente) e já ter uma public-key cadastrada.</p>
<p>Para cadastrar uma public-key é só logar no GitHub, clicar em account
(no canto superior direito) e clicar em &ldquo;add public key&rdquo; que vão
aparecer os campos para inserir a mesma.</p>
<p>Você pode encontrar a sua public key no diretório <code>~/.ssh</code> com o
comando:</p>
<pre><code>cat id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>
<p>Caso ele não exista basta acessar sua home (~) e cria-lo com:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OBS</strong>: Eu tenho <a href="http://pothix.com/blog/slackware/deixando-seu-ssh-mais-facil-de-trabalhar" title="">um post</a>
com mais informações sobre chave e SSH.</p>
<p>Depois pegar o conteúdo do arquio id_rsa.pub e colocar lá no GitHub.
Voltando a criação do repositório&hellip; Primeiramente crie um diretório
<a href="http://github.com/repositories/new" title=" Novo repositório no
GitHub">por aqui</a>:</p>
<p>Depois de criar você já terá um local acessível para enviar seu
código, que por sinal ainda não existe, portanto&hellip;.Vamos criá-lo! :)</p>
<p>Primeiramente crie um diretório qualquer:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir codes
</code></pre>
<p>Acesse o diretório:</p>
<pre><code>cd codes
</code></pre>
<p>E vamos iniciar o git nesse repositório:</p>
<pre><code>git init
</code></pre>
<p>Coloque aqui seu arquivo de código (não necessáriamente código, mas
nesse caso vamos usar código ;)) e vamos adicioná-lo ao git:</p>
<pre><code>git add mycode.rb (obs: Ruby o/)
</code></pre>
<p>Agora vamos dar um commit do que fizemos usando &ldquo;-m&rdquo; para deixar uma
mensagem do motivo do commit:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;Meu primeiro commit&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Agora vamos adicionar como origem o nosso projeto criado no GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:seu-usuario-no-GitHub/nome-do-repositorio-criado.git
</code></pre>
<p>E depois é só dar um:</p>
<pre><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>
<p>E lá está o seu código no GitHub! :)</p>
<p>Tudo que eu falei aqui está no tutorial do GitHub quando você cria um
diretório:</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/guides/setting-up-a-remote-repository-using-github-and-osx" title="">http://github.com/guides/setting-up-a-remote-repository-using-github-and-osx</a></p>
<p>Por enquanto é isso! Algo bem simples só para você não se assustar
quando lhe falarem de GitHub.</p>

I&amp;rsquo;m just posting to inform that I want to post some content in English too! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make a RSS Feed only for my English posts, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to view my portuguese posts on your feed reader. :)
As everyone knows, my English is not so good, but I think you can understand me well! Any English errors (I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will have a lot of them) please tell me and I&amp;rsquo;ll correct it asap.</description>

            <description>Como eu disse no ultimo post agora eu vou fazer uns pomsts sobre uns jogos que eu estou voltando a jogar no PSP, dizendo o que eu achei, como foi jogar ele, defeitos, qualidades, gosto pessoal e tudo mais!
Primeiramente vou falar sobre o gosto pessoal. Eu nunca fui muito fã de jogos de corrida, foram poucos que realmente me fizeram jogar até o final, e esse realmente foi um deles!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Como eu disse no <a href="http://pothix.com/blog/games/voltando-a-ser-um-gamer">ultimo post</a>
agora eu vou fazer uns pomsts sobre uns jogos que eu estou voltando a
jogar no PSP, dizendo o que eu achei, como foi jogar ele, defeitos,
qualidades, gosto pessoal e tudo mais!</p>
<p>Primeiramente vou falar sobre o gosto pessoal. Eu nunca fui muito fã
de jogos de corrida, foram poucos que realmente me fizeram jogar até o
final, e <strong>esse realmente foi um deles</strong>! Outros que eu realmente
recomendo são: Speed Devils (dreamcastd), Crash Team Racing (
playstation), Le Mans 24 Hours (dreamcast) e Demolition Racer (
dreamcast).</p>
<p>Bem, agora começando a falar sobre o que diz o o título desse post:
<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/psp/driving/needforspeedmostwanted/index.html">Need For Speed - Most Wanted</a>!
Esse jogo segue a mesma linha dos velhos
<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/driving/needforspeedhotpursuit2/index.html">Need for Speed Hot Pursuit</a>,
mas agora misturando com a linha
<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/driving/nfsunderground/review.html">Need For Speed Underground</a>!</p>
<h3 id="a-história">A história</h3>
<p>Se baseia em você ser o Mais procurado (qualquer um que saiba um pouco
de inglês já teria pensado em algo parecido né? :P) entre uma lista de
Tuners (sei lá como traduzir isso&hellip; Modificadores de carros), sendo
que você inicia na 15 posição da lista e vai passando por várias
corridas até chegar ao dono da posição que você quer conquistar, e
vencendo ele você passa ele para trás e toma sua posição, assim
podendo disputar a posição acima.</p>
<h3 id="a-evolução-no-jogo">A evolução no jogo</h3>
<p>Se baseia em <em>respect</em> (respeito), portanto quanto mais respeito você
tem mais você pode avançar, então não necessariamente você precisa
ganhar do cara que está na sua posição atual para poder disputar
corridas da outra posição, desde que você consiga respeito o
suficiente para passar para o próximo nível sem vencê-lo. Você
consegue respeito tanto nas corridas como em propostas que lhe são
feitas após terminar uma corrida. As propostas são desafios do tipo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despista os policiais e recebe mais respeito ou fica sem nada</li>
</ul>
<p>E se você aceitar, você deve se distanciar dos policiais o suficiente
para despista-los antes que eles se distanciem de você e lhe façam
barreiras para furar seus pneus ou consigam te bloquear e prender.</p>
<h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
<p>Não cheguei jogar em modo multiplayer por falta de oportunidade, pois
não tenho amigos jogando PSP sempre por perto, e meus primos do
NerdNightGames ainda não estão jogando esse jogo.</p>
<p>O modo infrastructure só funciona com internet que está configurada
como WEP (não sei por que&hellip;), portanto como a minha está
configuradinha como WPA eu não consigo usar&hellip;No trabalho é a mesma
coisa, portanto o modo infrastructure não mudou nada para mim. :(</p>
<h3 id="o-modo-carrer">O modo carrer</h3>
<p>É bem interessante, apesar de não me empolgar com esse tipo de modo,
eu achei legal ter que conseguir carros novos para modificar, e sempre
esperando que seja liberada uma nova atualização de performance para
que eu possa vencer determinada corrida e tal. Tem uma hora que o jogo
realmente te força bastante por que seu carro não é bom o suficiente
para vencer e você não pode errar nenhuma vez para conseguir ganhar,
alem de ser uma pista cheia de curvas e tráfego, ou seja, é o ápice do
jogo! Depois disso você consegue carros mais legais e dá para terminar
o jogo tranquilo.</p>
<p>Após você passar um adversário e ganhar seu nível você ganha tambem um
evento bônus para conseguir upgrades visuais bônus tambem! :)</p>
<h3 id="a-polícia">A polícia</h3>
<p>É muito chata e te atrapalha bastante nas corridas, não que isso seja
um erro, afinal o trabalho da polícia lá é esse mesmo, e uma coisa que
eu achei legal é ela tambem atrapalhar os adversários! Já aconteceu da
polícia estar tão &ldquo;Sangue nos olhos&rdquo; que todos os meus adversários
estavam presos e eu tinha 3 viaturas me cercando até o final da
corrida! Fora as várias vezes que eu tenho uma grande vantagem e a
polícia me alcança ( não importa se você tem uma lamborghini gallardo
que anda a 210 mph, ela vai te pegar ) e vira meu carro para a direção
contrária.</p>
<h3 id="momentos-wtf">Momentos WTF</h3>
<p>Algumas das inteligencias artificiais estava meio bizarras&hellip; Aconteceu
de eu ganhar a corrida por que ao chegar perto da linha de chegada o
meu adversário deu uma leve freiada não se sabe por que&hellip; não tinha
adversário nem policia na frente dele. (???)</p>
<p>A fisica de batida dos carros tambem é meio bizarra&hellip; Quando você vem
a toda velocidade numa rua e bate de frente com o carro muitas das
vezes você continuava andando e o carro que você bateu saia voando em
parafuso e ficava uns 10 segundos capotando (???)</p>
<p>Eu cheguei a ver um carro coadjuvante desaparecer do nada após eu
fazer uma curva :P</p>
<h3 id="soundtrack">Soundtrack</h3>
<p>Dou muito valor a soudtrack dos jogos, e desse jogo até que ficou
legal! Como sempre bem baseada em black ( não curto muito ), mas tinha
um ou dois metalzinhos tambem e um outro estilinho, combina bastante
com o jogo! :)</p>
<h3 id="end-of-the-road-for-me">End of the road for me</h3>
<p>Essa semana eu terminei o game com todos os carros e todos os upgrades
do modo carrer! Para fechar o jogo 100% só faltou pegar todos os
carros de policia num modo fora do modo carrer, mas esse modo é meio
chatinho e eu não estou com muito saco de jogar ele, portanto as
minhas brincadeiras com o Most Wanted terminam aqui.</p>
<p>Aqui fica tambem o motivo de eu não curtir muito jogo de
corrida&hellip; Agora eu cheguei no topo, e sou o mais procurado&hellip; E aí?
Não veio nem um vídeo legal, nem alguma coisa divertida, nem um
congratulations, simplesmente terminou, ganhou tudo e acabou, posso
ficar correndo ainda em qualquer pista, acho meio vago isso.</p>
<p>Aí ficam as minhas considerações sobre o jogo! ;)</p>

            <description>Esse aqui vai ser um post um pouco fora do escopo &amp;ldquo;programação&amp;rdquo;, mas ainda no escopo &amp;ldquo;nerd&amp;rdquo;! :)
Com esse post eu pretendo introduzir uma nova série (não achei palavra melhor) posts sobre os games que eu estou jogando atualmente, postanto umas opiniões e tudo mais, e quem sabe até alguns jogos que eu pretendo instalar no Linux.
Vou contar um pouco do título &amp;ldquo;Voltando a ser um gamer&amp;rdquo;.
Eu sempre gostei de jogar vídeo games desde pequeno, a ponto da minha mãe dizer que eu só podia jogar 3 horas por dia&amp;hellip; hahaha&amp;hellip; Tive poucos vídeo games pois meus pais não tinham tanto dinheiro assim para ficar comprando novos, portanto se eu quisesse algo novo eu tinha que me virar e comprar.</description>

<p>Com esse post eu pretendo introduzir uma nova <em>série</em> (não achei
palavra melhor) posts sobre os games que eu estou jogando
atualmente, postanto umas opiniões e tudo mais, e quem sabe até alguns
jogos que eu pretendo instalar no Linux.</p>
<p>Vou contar um pouco do título &ldquo;<strong>Voltando</strong> a ser um gamer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Eu sempre gostei de jogar vídeo games desde pequeno, a ponto da minha
mãe dizer que eu só podia jogar 3 horas por dia&hellip; hahaha&hellip; Tive poucos
vídeo games pois meus pais não tinham tanto dinheiro assim para ficar
comprando novos, portanto se eu quisesse algo novo eu tinha que me
virar e comprar.</p>
<p>Primeiramente tive o bom e velho <a href="http://www.atarifun.com/atari%202600%20console%20and%20controllers.jpg" title="">Atari</a> (era bem pequeno nessa época)</p>
<p>Mais pra frente ganhei um
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System-USA.jpg">SuperNES</a>,
que me trouxe bons divertimentos com vários jogos clássicos como
TopGear, Super Mario World, Road Rash, Samurai Spirit, International
Super Star Soccer (eu ainda gostava de futebol nessa época), Street
Fighter, Final Fight, Double Dragon e muitos outros!</p>
<p>Saí do SuperNes para ir para o Playstation (tive que me virar e rifar
o meu SuperNes para comprar o PS), onde me diverti bastante com Ace
Combat 2, Fighting force, Syphon Filter, Monster Rancher 2, Spider
Man, Street Fighter Ex Plus, Metal Gear Solid, Soul Edge, Bload Roar e
mais vários jogos legais.</p>
<p>Vendi meu Playstation, e aproveitei para comprar um <a href="http://images.techtree.com/ttimages/story/75827_gbc.jpg" title="">GameBoy
Color</a>
(sim&hellip;Foi na época do Pokémon)</p>
<p>Um adendo na minha vida de Gamer! Eu sempre participava dos encontros
do <a href="http://www.classicgaming.com.br/canal3/">canal3</a> com meu primo
<a href="http://nietto.cjb.net/" title="Marcelo Nietto">Marcelo Nietto</a> e era sempre
<a href="http://www.classicgaming.com.br/Images/Canal3/Eventos/18o_Encontro/encontro18_12.jpg" title="Jogando!">muito legal</a>
ver vídeo games antigos (e de vez em quando até uns OFF-TOPICs com vídeo games novos!),
jogar o bom, velho e divertido campeonato de War Lords!</p>
<p>Felizmente nessa época eu comecei a trabalhar, não oficialmente mas já
conseguia um dinheirinho, portanto comprei um
<a href="http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/archives/cool/98-10-12/dreamcast.jpg">dreamcast</a>,
mesmo sabendo que a linhagem de jogos dele estava acabando e a
SEGA estava desistindo de continuar a investir, mas achei que valia a
pena, afinal, além dos meus amigos tinham, e eu tinha visto jogos bem
legais, como SNK x CAPCOM, Marvel x CAPCOM 2, Crazy Taxy e etc. Me
diverti muito com o Dreamcast tambem! Joguei bastante Shenmue (o
melhor jogo de todos os tempos, que eu quero saber o resto da história
até hoje), Record Of Lodoss War, Tony Hawks 2, Le Mans 24 Hours, Sega
GT, Sonic Adventure 2 (era tanto vício nesse que quando saia levava o
VMU com o Sonic para jogar heheeh), Soul Calibur, Sega Tennis, e
vários outros bem legais!</p>
<p>Agora depois disso tudo começa a &ldquo;decadência&rdquo; da vida de gamer&hellip;:P</p>
<p>Vendi meu GameBoy por que já nem estava jogando mais&hellip;</p>
<p>Finalmente comprei meu primeiro computador (com 16 anos de idade&hellip; Só
quando comecei a trabalhar de verdade ), com o seguinte pensamento:
&ldquo;Vou conseguir rodar uns jogos da hora!&rdquo;, com uma GeForce4! (agora
não é muita coisa, mas na época era foda!). Joguei bastante coisa
legal, como Need For Speed Underground, Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2,
Diablo, Diablo 2, Halo, Gunbound, Metin 2, Unreal Tournament esse eu
me matei de jogar! A ponto de ir na casa do meu primo com vários
disquetes e voltar com os novos Skins que ele baixava! :D ) e mais
vários outros!</p>
<p>Bem, mas voltando a decadência ( de gamer, obviamente )&hellip;Nesse tempo
eu comecei a conhecer mais o Linux e a programação! E meu espírito
gamer se foi de vez! :P</p>
<ul>
<li>Encostei de vez o meu Dreamcast, mas não tive coragem de vender</li>
<li>Abandonei os jogos de computador, não que eu nao gostasse mais, mas eu tinha mais vontade de programar ou estudar coisas do gênero enquanto eu estava em frente ao computador, e tambem com o meu curso na ETE, sempre tinha alguma coisa para fazer.</li>
<li>Nesse tempo eu tambem comecei a trabalhar com programação, o que me animou mais a estudar para fazer outras coisas! :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pois bem&hellip; Tinha me livrado dos games e estava feliz como programador
e jogador casual quando dava. Ficou assim até poucos meses atrás,
quando eu fui para a faculdade e me aparece um colega meu com um
aparelho portátil preto com logotipo da Sony que eu já tinha ouvido
falar&hellip;PSP! Isso mesmo! E ele me contou como se divertia com o
bichinho, que dava para ver vídeos, ouvir musica, e jogar vários jogos
bem legais e tal.</p>
<p>Tudo isso somado com meu novo colega de faculdade chamado Leonardo
Foroni, que tem as mesmas características que eu tinha na minha época
de gamer hardcore.</p>
<p>Adivinha no que deu? Sim! menos de 1 mês depois estou eu com o meu
PSP! Demorei um pouco para começar a jogar no bichinho, mas aos poucos
eu estou vontando a me tornar um gamer hardcore!</p>
<p>Inclusive criei junto com os meus primos ( os velhos amigos de games ) o
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20081130NerdNightGames2#">NerdNightGames</a>,
que é um evento interno na casa do
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7IvEn9jLkK4AnS5zeMlhFw" title="LeoStorm">meu primo</a>
onde passamos uma madrugada (geralmente de sábado para
domingo) só jogando em rede, tanto de PSPs como de computadores!</p>
<p>Então hoje mantenho Dreamcast guardadinho e meu PSP sempre com jogos
legais, onde jogo sempre depois do almoço, e a noite antes de durmir!
Como o PSP está sempre comigo (ouço meus Podcasts nele tambem)
sempre que possível e seguro eu estou jogando!</p>
<p>Os jogos de PC estão instalados no windows Vista que veio no meu
notebook (deixei numa partição minúscula), que por sinal eu só uso
no Nerd Night Games, afinal, para que mais o Windows serve senão para
usar como vídeo game. ;)</p>
<p>Confesso que agora que sou programador o velho sonho de criança de se
desenvolver jogos (que eu destruí pensando que era um sonho
impossível de criança, assim como aqueles que queriam ser jogadores de
futebol) veio a tona, e eu ainda vou desenvolver algo, mesmo que seja
pequeno. Com isso eu tambem me tornei uma pessoa mais crítica quanto a
jogos, prestando mais atenção na inteligencia artificial dos inimigos,
pequenos erros que acontecem e passam meio desapercebidos e outras
coisinhas, o que me motiva mais ainda a escrever sobre os jogos que
estou terminando!</p>
<p>Só para finalizar, outra coisa que está me motivando a voltar a jogar
agora é o <a href="http://www.nowloading.com.br/">Podcast NowLoading</a>
que tem sempre informações muito legais e conteúdo bem
divertido!</p>
<p>Como eu disse&hellip; Esse post é para vocês entenderem por que eu vou
começar a postar um pouco alguns jogos tambem. :)</p>
<p>No mais nada mais! :)</p>

            <description>Faz um tempinho que eu estou querendo fazer um post seguindo os moldes da campanha do Marco Gomes, que também gerou o post do Diego Eis, e finalmente consegui um tempinho para expressar também a minha opinião nesse assunto! :)
Conheço muitas pessoas que fazem faculdade relacionada a programação, mas não aplicam o que estão vendo por lá, acham que já estão fazendo demais em ir para a faculdade e ficar lá no tempo em que o professor está falando&amp;hellip;Ou seja, essas pessoas não estão indo a faculdade para aprender algo para colocar em prática, eles estão lá simplesmente para &amp;ldquo;passar de ano&amp;rdquo;.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Faz um tempinho que eu estou querendo fazer um post seguindo os moldes
da campanha do <a href="http://marcogomes.com/blog/2008/campanha-programar-e-gratis" title="Programar é Grátis">Marco Gomes</a>,
que também gerou o
<a href="http://www.tableless.com.br/implementar-xhtmlcss-e-gratis" title="Implementar XHTML / CSS é grátis">post do Diego Eis</a>,
e finalmente consegui um tempinho para expressar também a minha opinião nesse assunto! :)</p>
<p>Conheço muitas pessoas que fazem faculdade relacionada a programação,
mas não aplicam o que estão vendo por lá, acham que já estão fazendo
demais em ir para a faculdade e ficar lá no tempo em que o professor
está falando&hellip;Ou seja, essas pessoas não estão indo a faculdade para
aprender algo para colocar em prática, eles estão lá simplesmente para
&ldquo;passar de ano&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As vezes não é nem tanto com faculdade também, tem pessoas que não
fazem faculdade, querem ser programadores, mas tem aquele pensamento:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahh&hellip;Eu preciso de uma oportunidade para aplicar os meus conhecimentos</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A internet está aí para isso! Você pode ter uma gama monstruosa de
ferramentas para brincar se quiser, tantos livros gratuitos para
aprender/melhorar sua programação, tantos projetos Open Source para
contribuir, cursos on-line gratuitos para fazer, mas o sujeito quer
&ldquo;ganhar uma oportunidade&rdquo; sem nem mesmo merecer ela.</p>
<p>Esse tipo de pessoa para mim <strong>não é programador</strong>!</p>
<p>O Marco Gomes costuma chamar esse tipo de pessoa de bunda mole, eu
tenho meu termo favorito que é muito utilizado por mim atualmente:
<strong>Marica!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gostaria de aprender a fazer isso por que é muito foda, mas parece muito difícil, então vou fazer o XY que é mais zuadinho mas é fácil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apertar parafusos também é fácil&hellip;Se as coisas fossem fáceis colocaríamos robôs para fazer&hellip; Marica!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estou trabalhando na empresa XY mas já estou cansado de lá&hellip;Cansei de suporte técnico, eu quero é ir programar, mas sem experiência fica difícil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vá e consiga sua experiência sozinho, faça um site e mostre quando for
na entrevista, como que o cara quer ter experiência sem fazer
nada&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Putz&hellip;Não conheço nada de Linux esse sistema é uma merda&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Esse é um candidato perfeito a ser um ótimo programador não é?!
Primeiro já caiu numa contradição, por que se ele não conhece nada,
como sabe que é uma merda? E outras, não quer nem conhecer um sistema
diferente onde ele terá suporte nativo a várias linguagens, e não só
isso, só o fato de não querer aprender algo <strong>gratuito</strong> e importante
para a carreira já faz dele um marica!</p>
<p>Portanto, vamos a alguns pontos importantes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invista tempo em aplicar o que você aprende na faculdade, ou caso não faça faculdade, corra atrás de coisas para estudar e aplique elas também.</li>
<li>Procure coisas diferente para saber, afinal, quanto maior a sua gama de conhecimentos mais difícil será você dizer para alguem: &ldquo;Não sei nem o que é isso&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Desenvolva coisas úteis e mostre seus código na internet, isso ainda vai ser muito útil para você ( tanto para aprendizado quanto para apresentação pessoal ).</li>
</ul>
<p>Para finalizar só quero frisar uma frase do post do Marco Gomes que é
muito interesssante e resume muito a minha opinião:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Você pode <strong>mudar sua vida</strong>, e até <strong>mudar o mundo</strong>, com o mesmo
equipamento que usa pra ficar o dia inteiro no orkut trocando
recadinhos com as peguetes&rdquo;</p>

            <title>A facilidade do Ubuntu</title>
            <link>https://pothix.com/posts/ubuntu/</link>

            <description>Deixa eu explicar aqui para quem estou destinando esse post. Esse post é destinado a algumas pessoas que costumam me perguntar se o Linux é difícil, se ele vai conseguir mexer nele se instalar, se Linux é melhor que Windows e outras perguntas derivadas disso, portanto se você já tem conhecimentos em Linux e já usa Linux esse post só vai servir para você passar para seus amigos que não usam, pois é bem básico.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Deixa eu explicar aqui para quem estou destinando esse post. Esse post
é destinado a algumas pessoas que costumam me perguntar se o Linux é
difícil, se ele vai conseguir mexer nele se instalar, se Linux é
melhor que Windows e outras perguntas derivadas disso, portanto se
você já tem conhecimentos em Linux e já usa Linux esse post só vai
servir para você passar para seus amigos que não usam, pois é bem
básico.</p>
<p>Depois de comprar meu notebook e instalar o Ubuntu nele eu decidi
fazer esse post para acabar com aquela idéia das pessoas de que Linux
é difícil, que não faz nada, que nada funciona e etc.</p>
<p>Bem, eu <a href="http://pothix.com/blog/win2linux/como-sao-os-primeiros-passos-de-um-linuxer">sempre gostei de utilizar o Slackware</a>
(e ainda é minha distribuição principal) e realmente Slackware não é
distribuição Linux para qualquer um&hellip;Você não pode dar um Slackware
na mão de um usuário final e falar para ele que é fácil, e talvez essa
seja a visão que os usuários de Windows tem do Linux.</p>
<p>Estou usando o Ubuntu faz mais ou menos uns 2 ou 3 meses, e muitas
vezes já me surpreendi com a facilidade de se fazer as coisas nele!
Mesmo um usuário final faria as coisas com uma facilidade espantosa
bastando apenas que ele queira conhecer coisas novas.</p>
<h3 id="alguns-exemplos">Alguns Exemplos</h3>
<h4 id="instalando-impressora">Instalando impressora</h4>
<p>Estava eu precisando imprimir um documento e já pensei&hellip; Configurar a
impressora vai ser Punk, mas vou tentar. Procurei nos menus do Gnome e
vi um &ldquo;Printers&rdquo; em:</p>
<p><strong>System &gt; Administration &gt; Printers</strong></p>
<p>E lá eu clico em &ldquo;New&rdquo; ele vai identificar todas as impressoras que
você tem na rede e plugadas no seu computador e te mostrar uma lista
de drivers para que você escolha qual utilizar.</p>
<p>Ou seja&hellip;Não tem dificuldade nenhuma.</p>
<h4 id="instalando-programas">Instalando programas</h4>
<p>Muitos usuários tem medo do terminal, e alguns se atrevem a dizer que
é regredir muitos anos (eles são criativos ;)), mas o terminal te
facilita muita coisa em diversas tarefas rapidamente.</p>
<p>Podemos instalar novos programas rapidamente pelo terminal com um
simples comando! Digamos que queremos instalar o Inkscape para brincar
de fazer uns desenhos vetoriais, é moleza:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install inkscape
</code></pre>
<p>Pronto! Ele vai te dar informações sobre o pacote e perguntar se você
quer mesmo instalar o pacote que ele mostrou as informações ( caso
tenha digitado errado não instalar um pacote qualquer ), e é só
responder Y que ele vai instalar e deixar o programa prontinho para
usar!</p>
<h4 id="atualizando-a-distribuição">Atualizando a distribuição</h4>
<p>Além das atualizações normais que ele faz diariamente (obviamente é
facilmente configurável) tambem faz automáticamente as
atualizações de distribuição!</p>
<p>Pouco tempo atrás foi lançado o Ubuntu 8.10, e eu como tinha o Ubuntu
8.04, pensei em atulizar, e eis que surge uma atualização de
distribuição automáticamente no meu gerenciador de pacotes,
perguntando se eu gostaria de ir para a outra versão! :)</p>
<p>Obviamente é um processo demorado, pois são muitos pacotes para
atualizar (no meu caso foram mais de 1300), portanto muitos MBs (no
meu caso mais de 900) e muitos pacotes para instalar.</p>
<p>Tirando o tempo de download, pois depende muito da sua velocidade de
banda, ele instalou todos os pacotes em 20 minutos! E foi só reiniciar
(afinal foram mais de 1300 pacotes atualizados) para que eu tivesse
as ultimas atualizações da distribuição funcionando no meu notebook.</p>
<h4 id="interface">Interface</h4>
<p>A interface do Ubuntu é bem facil de manipular, você pode arrastar
atalhos para suas barras, usar alguns efeitos divertidos como deixar
as janelas se motimentando como se fossem feitas de gelatina,
configurar o que deve e o que não deve aparecer para você no seu menu
e etc.</p>
<p>Não se familiarizou com a interface do Ubuntu? Ok, isso pode
acontecer, então você pode não usar o Gnome (interface principal do
Ubuntu) para usar o KDE (Interface principal do Kubuntu), é só você
instalar o Kubuntu ao invés do Ubuntu para que você já tenha uma
interface diferente para utilizar.</p>
<h4 id="aplicativos-para-escritório">Aplicativos para escritório</h4>
<p>O Ubuntu já vem com ferramentas para suas edições simples, como
processador de texto (writter), Planilhas (calc) e criador de
Slides para apresentação (presentation) para que você possa fazer
suas ações simples de escritório facilmente. Ele tambem traz um
aplicativo para você receber todos os seus e-mails no seu computador e
poder lê-los offline após baixar (evolution).</p>
<p>O Ubuntu já traz por padrão um aplicativo de Lista de taferas (todo
list) para que você possa gerenciar suas tarefas facilmente e se
organizar melhor.</p>
<p>Lembrando que esses são apenas os aplicativos nativos, mas você pode
instalar facilmente outros programar para Linux com um simples <code>sudo apt-get install</code> ;)</p>
<h4 id="vídeos-e-musicas">Vídeos e musicas</h4>
<p>Você pode facilmente ouvir suas musicas e ver seus vídeos preferidos
no Linux usando alguns programas a parte como o
<a href="http://amarok.kde.org/" title="Amarok">amarok</a> e o
<a href="http://xinehq.de/index.php/releases" title="Gxine">gxine</a> ou o
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html" title="MPlayer">mplayer</a>, apenas
usando o seu padrão <code>apt-get install</code> para instalar, nada de sair
procurando aplicativos, baixando e depois instalando. ;)</p>
<p>Você provavelmente vai precisar de uns plugins para assistir os seus
vídeos dependendo do formato deles e isso depende do seu player e do
tipo de vídeo, mas nada muito difícil de se conseguir! =)</p>
<h4 id="internet">Internet</h4>
<p>O que você usa está na internet? Você usa o internet explorer no seu
sistema? Saia do lado negro pelo amor de Deus! :P</p>
<p>O Ubuntu já vem com o Firefox instalado e é tudo facinho para
utilizar. Você pode acessar a grande maioria dos sites da internet
normalmente, e se por um acaso você encontrar um site que você não
consiga navegar com o FIrefox você pode usar a</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59">extensão User Agent
Switcher</a>
do Firefox e ele vai renderizar a página como se
fosse um internet explorer para que você possa navegar. Mas se isso
realmente acontecer faça um favor para toda a internet e envie um
e-mail para o criador desse site reclamando dos seus problemas, pois
pelo visto ele não está nem pensando em muitas pessoas.</p>
<p>Precisa usar o MSN? Moleza! Só usar o <a href="http://kopete.kde.org/">Kopete</a>,
o <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/" title="Pidgin">Pidgin</a>, o
<a href="http://www.amsn-project.net/" title="aMSN">aMSN</a> ou qualquer um dos outros
vários que tem para esse serviço! Mas&hellip;Quer uma dica? Use outros
serviços bem mais interessantes como o do Gtalk (que pode ser
configurado no Pidgin e no Kopete) ou até mesmo o
<a href="www.skype.com" title="Skype">Skype</a> (que pode ser instalado com apt-get
install :P )</p>
<h4 id="fotos">Fotos</h4>
<p>Quer manusear suas fotos, fazer modificações, disponibilizar elas na
internet? Isso é tudo moleza no Ubuntu!</p>
<p>Se você gosta de ter um programa para gerenciar suas fotos, criar
alguns, colocar tags, fazer upload para a internet e mais um monte de
coisas, é só usar o <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" title="Picasa">Picasa</a>
(adivinha como instalar ele? Sim! apt-get install) que é um das
<a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_ferramentas_e_servi%C3%A7os_do_Google">dezenas de serviços do Google</a>
e portanto fica vinculado com a sua conta do
Google (Gmail, Orkut ou outros) e suas fotos ficam na internet <strong>se
você quiser</strong> , pois podem ficar apenas no seu computador tambem.</p>
<p>Tirou uma foto e ela não ficou legal? Basta dar uma pequena alterada
usando o <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" title="GIMP">GIMP</a>, que é um manipulador de
imagens bem interessante para se conhecer, e é claro que é gratuito e
Open Souce. ( preciso dizer que é facil de instalar? )</p>
<h4 id="jogos">Jogos</h4>
<p>Esse tópico é um pouco contraditório com o que você deve estar
esperando, pois você não vai encontrar o seu</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/">GTA San
Andreas</a>,
<a href="http://thesims.ea.com/" title="The Sims">The Sims</a>,
<a href="http://www.spore.com/ftl" title="Spore">Spore</a> (ou seja lá o que for que
você jogue em outro sistema operacional) em versão oficial para
Linux. Até podem existir versões portadas dos seus jogos para Linux ou
utilizando <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" title="Wine">Wine</a> (pode ser baixado
por apt-get para variar um pouco) que roda programas de Windows no
Linux, mas o Wine ainda não está perfeito e não vai ser qualquer jogo
que vai rodar facilmente com ele&hellip;:/</p>
<p>Em compensação o Linux tem
<a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogos_Linux" title="Jogos para Linux">alguns jogos nativos</a>
que são legais, obviamente não tanto quando outros jogos e não em
maior quantidade, mas eles existem! :)</p>
<p>Tem um <a href="http://www.techforce.com.br/index.php/news/linux_blog/jogos_no_linux">post muito legal no Techforce</a>
que fala de alguns modos para rodar jogos no Linux, alguns jogos que
tem versão para Linux e outras coisas bem interessantes.</p>
<p>Se você é um gamer que seu computador se tornou um vídeo game, agora
<strong>ainda</strong> não é seu momento com Linux, mas quem sabe ele virá! ;)</p>
<p>Bem&hellip;Tentei mostrar acima muitas coisas simples que as pessoas
utilizam e podem fazer normalmente (e facilmente) no Linux, apenas
para mostrar que o Linux tem ferramentas para você fazer as coisas e
tem coisas interessantes, mas ainda precisamos assumir essa mudança de
paradigma e mudança de conceito para decidirmos aprender mais coisas e
ver como é legal outras coisas que nem lhe passavam pela cabeça que
existiam.</p>
<p>Se tiverem alguma dúvida é só postar nos comentários, que farei o
possível para responder.</p>

            <description>Nesse post eu vou contar um pouco de como são os primeiros passos de alguem que quer mesmo brincar com Linux. No caso vou falar como eu comecei com o Linux! Vamos lá! :)
Eu sempre ouvia falar de Linux quando eu lia Livros sobre segurança e tudo mais, portanto sempre tinha vontade de utilizar&amp;hellip; Meu primeiro contato direto com Linux foi em 2004, mas nessa época eu ainda era bem fanático por jogos de computador, o que me fez continuar no Windows por um tempo.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nesse post eu vou contar um pouco de como são os primeiros passos de
alguem que quer mesmo brincar com Linux. No caso vou falar como <strong>eu</strong>
comecei com o Linux! Vamos lá! :)</p>
<p>Eu sempre ouvia falar de Linux quando eu lia Livros sobre segurança e
tudo mais, portanto sempre tinha vontade de utilizar&hellip; Meu primeiro
contato direto com Linux foi em 2004, mas nessa época eu ainda era bem
fanático por jogos de computador, o que me fez continuar no Windows
por um tempo.</p>
<p>No meio de 2005 eu comecei a utilizar a minha primeira distro de Linux,
que foi o <a href="http://www.gdhpress.com.br/kurumin/" title="Kurumin">Kurumin</a>!</p>
<p>Ele seguia o mesmo caminho que o <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>
segue hoje, que é facilitar o Linux para o usuário
doméstico, ele era até bem legal, mas na época eu sofria muito por ter
internet discada, e nos tempos com Linux é muito difícil,
principalmente para um usuário inexperiente.</p>
<p>Na época eu não podia ter banda larga por vários motivos, portanto a
única solução era a discada mesmo, então eu tentei várias formas para
sobreviver com Linux assim, testei várias versões do Kurumin, peguei
vários softmodens emprestados para saber qual funcionaria bem, comprei
um hardmodem USRobotics para ver se conseguia fazer funcionar 100%,
mas não adiantou muita coisa&hellip;</p>
<p>Mesmo com os meus problemas com internet discada, essa foi a época que
eu aboli de vez o Windows e fiquei somente com o Kurumin na minha
maquina, pois eu descobri que o Kurumin 4.2 funcionava com meu moden
Intel537Ep.</p>
<p>Posteriormente quando comecei a fazer
<a href="http://www.centropaulasouza.sp.gov.br/Ete/Escolas/Metrop_Sao_Paulo/Diadema_ETEC_Diadema.html">ETE</a>,
e lá eu tinha matérias como C# e VB.net onde eu tinha que usar o
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">Visual Studio</a>,
portanto precisava do Windows instalado novamente, e
ainda por cima consegui meu primeiro trabalho com programação (uhuu!)
trabalhando com ASP e VB.NET (duuhhp) , portanto fui obrigado a
voltar para o Windows, e mesmo com dual boot o Kurumin um pouco de
lado.</p>
<p>Durante a ETE tive um trabalho sobre o Linux para fazer, onde tive que
conhecer melhor o Kalango&hellip; Instalei ele, dei uma brincada, mas
realmente não gostei da distro&hellip; Se fosse para utilizar o Kalango eu
ficava no Kurumin mesmo.</p>
<p>Durante esse tempo eu tambem tentei brincar com o Slackware, mas
devido a internet (novamente) eu não tive a menor chance contra
ele&hellip; Minha experiência era muito pouca para poder fazer funcionar um
modem para acesso discado no Slack. :P</p>
<p>Quando finalmente consegui ter internet banda larga eu já resolvi
extrapolar para aprender e usar o Slackware de vez! :)</p>
<p>Foi a época que eu penei bastante para aprender coisas simples que eu
não tinha noção e que o Slackware deixa para vc se virar ao invés de
tentar fazer com alguma fórmula mágica, e esse foi o principal motivo
de eu usar Slackware, para saber onde e porque as coisas acontecem.</p>
<p>Agora com a internet banda larga (não tãão larga assim)
funcionando ficou bem mais fácil de usar Slackware, afinal, se tinha
alguma coisa que eu não sabia era só pesquisar sobre o assunto ou
perguntar para o pessoal da comunidade, e assim eu conseguia resolver
os pequenos probleminhas aos poucos.</p>
<p>Agora que já conhecia um pouco mais e minha experiência tinha
aumentado um pouco eu resolvi testar outros Window Managers! Eu queria
algo mais leve que o <a href="http://www.kde.org/" title="KDE official page">KDE</a>
(que eu sempre utilizei), queria algo minimalista, algo simples, curto
e grosso, e foi então que eu achei o <a href="http://fluxbox.org/">Fluxbox</a>
e descobri que eu poderia ter um Window
Manager totalmente configurável, leve, bonito (se você quiser
deixá-lo assim) e funcional, portanto defini ele como meu WM
principal e ainda uso só o Flux até hoje no Slackware.</p>
<p>Durante o final de 2006 e o meio do ano de 2007 eu utilizei pouco o
Linux por 2 motivos:</p>
<ol>
<li>Devido a ETE que pedia muito coisas de Windows e portanto eu não gostava de ter de ficar trocando de sistema operacional a todo momento.</li>
<li>Comprei um Palm T|X e na época eu estava começando a brincar com o bichinho e usar o Palm Desktop</li>
</ol>
<p>Nessa época tive um problema e formatei o computador por completo,
portanto perdi meu Slackware que estava configuradinho e perdi meus
arquivos do Windows, portanto tive que refazer todas as instalações,
mas eu estava sem tempo para configurar o Slackware novamente para
deixar como eu queria, portanto ele ficou de lado até que eu
conseguisse tempo novamente.</p>
<p>Com o fim do meu curso na ETE em julho de 2007, meu tempo retornou e
pude voltar a brincar com o Slackware novamente, mesmo trabalhando com
tecnologia Microsoft, sempre que eu podia brincar com meu Linux eu
brincava, e deixava o Windows para trabalhar e para video game.</p>
<p>Em 2008 eu iniciei meu curso de
<a href="http://www.fsa.br/conteudo/index.asp?c=2&amp;s=13&amp;ss=185">Sistemas de informação na Fundação Santo André</a>,
e nos primeiros dias me vem uma pequena decepção que eu não
esperava&hellip;As minhas aulas de programação são em VB.net novamente,
portanto eu não tenho como fugir do windows por mais 1 ano&hellip;E o pior
de tudo, pensei que fosse encontrar bem mais pessoas com mente aberta
para coisas diferentes, filosofias diferentes, mas não foi bem assim
que as coisas de aconteceram&hellip;Mas enfim, não é o assunto desse post
;)</p>
<p>Durante esse ano que eu pensei que ia deixar o Linux de lado
novamente, mas aconteceram muitas coisas legais, como por exemplo eu
mudar de emprego (uhuu!) e agora trabalhar com
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby On Rails">tecnologia</a>
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" title="Ruby">Open</a>
<a href="http://www.php.net/" title="PHP">Source</a> (uhuuu!)², e portanto eu tenho
meu Slackware instalado no computador do trabalho, e comprei um
notebook, onde instalei o Ubuntu linux, tanto para conhecer como
também para facilitar algumas coisas, assim eu posso conhecer tanto o
modo Slackware de fazer as coisas como o modo rápido, fácil e mágico
do Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Hoje vivo feliz e contente brincando com meu Slackware e meu Ubuntu, e
não preciso mais do Windows para nada além do que é pedido (Visual
Studio&hellip;) na Faculdade, e isso me deixa muito contente.</p>
<p>No fim das contas o que esse post vem dizer é o seguinte: Se você acha
o Linux legal use, persista, conheça coisas diferentes, caso não seja
possível nesse momento tudo bem, mas deixe na sua lista de coisas a
fazer e assim que possível volte, que você vai descobrindo a
quantidade de coisas legais que você pode ter nesse sistema.</p>
<p>Espero que isso tudo seja útil para alguem! ;)</p>
<p>Keep going in the good way!</p>

            <description>Vou comentar agora sobre como montar aquela imagem chata do Nero (.nrg ) que seu amigo que gosta de janelas lhe enviou com aqueles vários arquivos que você tinha pedido&amp;hellip; É um hack bem fácil!
Instalações Primeiro instale o nrg2iso
No Ubuntu # apt-get install nrg2iso  No Slackware Baixando o pacote no Linux Packages e instalando normalmente com:
# installpkg nrg2iso-versao.tgz  Utilização Agora já podemos utilizar o nrg3iso para converter nossa imagem:</description>

            <description>Estou utilizando bastante o sshfs para transferir alguns arquivos para o servidor, ao invés de utilizar o bom e velho scp, por questão de ficar mais prático e facil a cópia de vários arquivos para diretórios distintos.
O que facilita bastante é utilizar a sua chave privada ( explicado por mim nesse tópico) para montar os seus diretórios sshfs, assim você terá o diretório do servidor montado facilmente em seu computador e poderá enviar arquivos para esse diretório e seus sub-diretórios como se estivesse copiando arquivos para outro diretório qualquer.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Estou utilizando bastante o

<p>Se você está no Ubuntu as coisas são fáceis e práticas, com o bom e velho apt-get:</p>
<pre><code># apt-get install sshfs
</code></pre>
<p>Agora se você utiliza Slackware temos alguns passos a mais, mas nada
que lhe faça arrancar os cabelos ;)</p>
<p>Primeiramente instale o
<a href="http://slackbuilds.org/repository/12.0/system/fuse/">fuse</a> no
<a href="http://pothix.com/blog/slackware/facilitando-a-instalacao-no-slackware" title="Facilitando a instalação no Slackware">velho esquema SlackBuilds</a>
(ou outro se preferir).</p>
<p>Depois instale o
<a href="http://www.linuxpackages.net/search_view.php?by=name&amp;name=sshfs&amp;ver=12.1">sshfs</a>
(dessa vez do Linux Packages para mudar um pouco)</p>
<h3 id="utilização">Utilização</h3>
<p>Primeiramente temos que subir o módulo do fuse:</p>
<pre><code># modprobe fuse
</code></pre>
<p>Essa tarefa pode ser automátizada posteriormente descomentando esse
módulo no <!-- raw HTML omitted -->/etc/rc.d/rc.modules<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>E com isso já podemos usar o nosso sshfs! :)</p>
<p>Eu costumo utilizar com os seguintes parâmetros:</p>
<pre><code>sshfs root@server:/local/da/pasta/no/server /local/da/minha/pasta/local -o reconnect,sshfs_sync
</code></pre>
<p>E agora é só correr para o abraço e ter o seu diretório do servidor
montado localmente para cópia de arquivos.</p>

            <description>Se você usa bastante SSH vou mostrar um método para facilitar um pouco a sua vida. Sei que existem métodos melhores para trabalhar com vários SSH ao mesmo tempo, geralmente a galera que administra vários servidores costuma usar screen para se manter conectado, mas eu como conecto de vez em quando para ver algo em algum dos servidores prefiro configurar desse modo.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Se você usa bastante <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh">SSH</a> vou
mostrar um método para facilitar um pouco a sua vida. Sei que existem
métodos melhores para trabalhar com vários SSH ao mesmo tempo,
geralmente a galera que administra vários servidores costuma usar
screen para se manter conectado, mas eu como conecto de vez em quando
para ver algo em algum dos servidores prefiro configurar desse modo.</p>
<p>A primeira coisa a se fazer é configurar o seu <code>.ssh/config</code></p>
<pre><code>Host server
Hostname 192.168.1.2
User pothix
ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre><p>Sendo que Host é o que você vai usar quando for chamar por ssh (por
exemplo &ldquo;ssh server&rdquo;), Hostname é o IP do server, User é o usuário no
servidor e ForwardAgent para usar o nosso ssh-agent.</p>
<p>Tem um totorial bem legal sobre
<a href="http://www.guiadohardware.net/tutoriais/dominando-ssh/pagina3.html">configuração de SSH no guia do Hardware</a>
que explica algumas opções.</p>
<p>Vamos agora configurar o nosso ssh-agent, que é um agente de
autenticação que gerencia as nossas conexões ssh na sua seção de
terminal.</p>
<p>Primeiramente você deve iniciar o seu ssh-agent:</p>
<pre><code>$ eval -s `ssh-agent -s`
</code></pre>
<p>Isso via iniciar o seu <code>ssh-agent</code> e já definir as variáveis de ambiente que ele precisa para funcionar na sua instancia atual do terminal.</p>
<p>Agora que já temos o nosso ssh-agent funcionando, vamos criar a nossa chave privada para utilizar:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f minha-chave
</code></pre><p>Com isso ele pedirá a a senha para sua chave e depois de você digitar
e confirmar ele criará dois arquivos de chave:</p>
<ul>
<li>minha-chave</li>
<li>minha-chave.pub</li>
</ul>
<p>O arquivo minha-chave é o arquivo que vamos usar para facilitar a
nossa vida, e o arquivo minha-chave.pub é o arquivo publico de
identificação da sua chave, falaremos mais disso depois.</p>
<p>Agora com nossa chave em mãos já podemos acrescentar ela no nosso
ssh-agent, utiliando o <code>ssh-add</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/minha-chave
</code></pre>
<p>Ele vai pedir a senha da sua chave e depois vai adicionar ela no
ssh-agent e agora é só alegria! :)</p>
<p>Agora vamos acessar o servidor que cadastramos no nosso
<code>~/.ssh/config</code></p>
<pre><code>$ ssh server
</code></pre>
<p>Lembra dele, que fizemos lá em cima? Pois é agora vamos acessar ele
sem precisar ficar digitando a senha toda vez, apenas usando a nossa
chave! :D</p>
<p>Lembrando que tem um porém! Isso só vai funcionar se nós estivermos
autorizados a acessar o servidor sem senha, utilizando a chave, e para
isso temos que ter o conteúdo do nosso minha-chave.pub no
<code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> do servidor, e o problema está resolvido!
:)</p>
<p>Isso para mim é uma mão na roda, e espero que seja para vocês
tambem. ;)</p>

            <description>Estava eu pesquisando na internet como conseguir fazer o meu numlock já iniciar ativado quando meu fluxbox inicia e encontrei várias dicas, sendo umas para XFCE e outros sistemas não sendo Slackware, portanto decidi escrever como fiz no Slackware.
Primeiramente precisamos do numlockx que é o programinha vai ativar o num facilmente.
Podemos instalar ele via SlackBuilds que eu uso muito!
Após baixar o numlockx.tar.gz e o numlockx-.version.tar.gz` vamos seguir os procedimentos do SlackBuilds:</description>

            <description>Como sabem, instalei o Ubuntu no meu notebook Toshiba U405-S2854, e estou brincando um pouco com programas bunitinhos e mais pesados do que os que eu costumava usar no Slackware.
Resolvi começar o Amarok para tocar os meus mp3, e ele lembra bastante o Itunes (ta certo que usei pouco o Itunes, mas conheço algumas funções dele).
Tive um pequeno probleminha para configurar minhas teclas multimedia para funcionar no amarok, já que elas vem configuradas para chamar o player padrão do Ubuntu&amp;hellip; Mas nada muito problemático tambem&amp;hellip;</description>

<p>Tive um pequeno probleminha para configurar minhas teclas multimedia
para funcionar no amarok, já que elas vem configuradas para chamar o
player padrão do Ubuntu&hellip; Mas nada muito problemático tambem&hellip;</p>
<p>Apenas precisei acessar:
<strong>System &gt; preferences &gt; Keyboard shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Colocar todos as teclas de atalho antigas para default.</p>
<p>Depois executei o amarok para acessar:
<strong>Settings &gt; configure global shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>E configurar as teclas novamente que irá funcionou! :)</p>
<p>De vez em quando lembro do meu bom, velho e minimalista XMMS, que por
sinal fazia tudo que eu precisava (tocar MP3! :P), mas o amarok é
bem legal tambem!</p>
<p>Estou usando alguns recursos legais do Amarok agora, que são:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeds e download automático dos Podcasts que eu ouço</li>
<li>Organização de playlists</li>
</ul>
<p>Ele tem várias outras funções para fazer gracinhas, como buscar letras
das musicas, informações sobre a banda, e mais um monte de
coisas&hellip;Mas para quem vem do XMMS isso já é muita frescura&hellip;hahaha</p>
<p>Fica aí a dica de um player bacana para o notebook com Ubuntu! :)</p>

            <description>Estava escrevendo outro post e chegando em um ponto onde eu instalaria um pequeno Software utilizando o SlackBuilds me fez escrever esse post sobre algumas facilitações de instalação para Slackware.
Nesse post eu vou referenciar 4 facilitadores para instalação de pacotes no Slackware: SlackBuilds, LinuxPackages, Slackpkg, Slapt-get e Checkinstall.
SlackBuilds Primeiramente vou comentar sobre um dos que eu mais uso e que mudou a minha vida ( heheh ), que é o SlackBuilds!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Estava escrevendo outro post e chegando em um ponto onde eu instalaria
um pequeno Software utilizando o
<a href="http://www.slackbuilds.org" title="Slack Builds">SlackBuilds</a> me fez
escrever esse post sobre algumas facilitações de instalação para
Slackware.</p>
<p>Nesse post eu vou referenciar 4 facilitadores para instalação de
pacotes no Slackware: SlackBuilds, LinuxPackages, Slackpkg, Slapt-get
e Checkinstall.</p>
<h3 id="slackbuilds">SlackBuilds</h3>
<p>Primeiramente vou comentar sobre um dos que eu mais uso e que mudou a
minha vida ( heheh ), que é o <a href="http://www.slackbuilds.org" title="Slack Builds">SlackBuilds</a>!</p>
<p>SlackBuilds são scripts que facilitam a instalação de softwares
diretamente pelo seu fonte, ao invés de usarmos o velho <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>.</p>
<p>Quando eu preciso instalar algo, o primeiro lugar que eu visito é o
<a href="http://www.slackbuilds.org" title="Slack Builds">site do SlackBuilds</a> para
procurar se tem o que eu estou procurando, depois procuro em outro
lugar.</p>
<p>Para usar o SlackBuilds é simples!</p>
<ul>
<li>Primeiro você encontra o seu pacote no site.</li>
<li>Agora você faz o download do pacote do SlackBuilds, que geralmente está no formato <code>nomeDoPacote.tar.gz</code></li>
<li>E faz o download do source do que você vai instalar, que geralmente está no formato: <code>nomeDoPacote-versao.tar.gz</code></li>
<li>Agora você descompacta o seu pacote SlackBuilds da forma tradicional: <code>tar xvf nomeDoPacote.tar.gz</code></li>
<li>Agora ele criou uma pasta do seu SlackBuilds com o nome de <code>nomeDoPacote</code>.</li>
<li>copie os fontes para a pasta do seu SlackBuilds: <code>cp nomeDoPacote-versao.tar.gz nomeDoPacote</code></li>
<li>Agora entre na pasta do seu SlackBuilds: <code>cd nomeDoPacote</code></li>
<li>E como root execute o seu arquivo de SlackBuilds: <code>./nomeDoPacote.SlackBuilds</code></li>
<li>Se tudo der certo nesse passo (pode ser que tenha alguma dependência, o que fará você tentar novamente o passo 1 para a dependência) ele vai compilar tudo para você e vai gerar um pacote .tgz do Slackware no seu <code>/tmp</code> ! :)</li>
<li>Agora é só correr para o abraço! Acessar o seu <code>/tmp</code> e instalar o pacote com o bom e velho <code>installpkg</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linux-packages">Linux Packages</h3>
<p>Como segunda opção para facilitar a instalação no Slackware temos o
<a href="http://linuxpackages.net" title="Linux Packages">Linux Packages</a> que tem
muitos pacotes tgz para você baixar e instalar facilmente com o
gerenciador de pacotes do Slackware.</p>
<h3 id="slackpkg">Slackpkg</h3>
<p>Para instalações mais automatizadas temos também o
<a href="http://piterpunk.info02.com.br/artigos/tutorial-slackpkg.html">Slackpkg</a>
que foi criado pelo <a href="http://piterpunk.info02.com.br/">Piter Punk</a>
como um script para atualização de pacotes mais
facilmente quando surgiam exploits ou bugs, e acabou se extendendo a
instalação de pacotes e outras features interessantes.</p>
<p>Eu utilizo o Slackpkg para atualizar pacotes e para instalar pacotes
padrão da distro, e para isso é muito bom, mas não pense que ele vai
instalar aquele pacote xyz que você estava procurando, pois ele não é
um apt-get.</p>
<h3 id="slapt-get">Slapt-get</h3>
<p><a href="http://software.jaos.org/" title="Página Oficial do Linux Packages">Slapt-get</a>
(pode-se fazer o download no <a href="http://www.linuxpackages.net/pkg_details.php?id=12307">Linux Packages</a>),
esse sim tenta ser um apt-get! Ele faz quase as mesmas coisas que o
apt-get faz, mas não resolve dependencias.</p>
<p>Ele tambem tem um arquivo de mirrors que fica localizado em
<code>/etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc</code>. E em termos de comandos não muda muito
do apt-get, e você pode usar o <code>slapt-get --install nomeDoPrograma</code> ou
<code>slapt-get --update</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checkinstall">Checkinstall</h3>
<p>O <a href="http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/download.php">checkinstall</a>
é utilizado para quando você estiver instalando um programa a partir
do seu fonte você possa gerar um pacote da sua distribuição no final
da instalação e instalar por ele, assim você terá mais controle pelo
seu gerenciador de pacotes e tambem para que da próxima vez seja mais
fácil instalá-lo.</p>
<p>A instalação segue padrão até o momento final:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure
$ make
</code></pre>
<p>E agora ao invés do nosso # make install usaremos:</p>
<pre><code># checkinstall -S
</code></pre>
<p>E assim ele vai criar um pacote Slackware no diretório e instalar. :)</p>
<p>Bem isso é só para dar uma idéia do que se pode fazer para deixar suas
instalações do Slackware mais rápidas.</p>

Não se preocupe muito com seu inglês, ele não precisa estar extremamente afiado para você participar, basta que você consiga entender bem para que você participe, e caso não consiga escrever bem o pessoal pode ajudar você a se expressar para conseguir ajuda nos Foruns!</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Como muitos sabem, eu sou um dos professores assistentes do
<a href="http://rubylearning.org/class" title="">Rubylearning.org</a> que oferece
<strong>gratuitamente</strong> cursos de ruby!</p>
<p>O <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/6778-satish-talim" title="">Satish Talim</a>
anunciou que estão abertas as inscrições para o FORPC101-9C ( Free
Online Ruby Programming Course 101 - Batch 9 Core) que é a série de
cursos gratuitos sobre Ruby Core.</p>
<p>Aconselho todos que querem aprender Ruby a participarem! Não se
preocupe muito com seu inglês, ele não precisa estar extremamente
afiado para você participar, basta que você consiga entender bem para
que você participe, e caso não consiga escrever bem o pessoal pode
ajudar você a se expressar para conseguir ajuda nos Foruns!</p>
<p>Eu (<a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_course_graduates.html">assim como muitos</a>)
recomendo! E estarei por lá para dar uma força a quem precisar.</p>
<p>Para quem se interessar, o Rubylearning tambem oferece alguns cursos
pagos (seguindo a mesma linha dos gratuitos):</p>
<h3 id="poirpwdc101-1i-paid-online-intermediate-ruby-programming-with-database-course">POIRPWDC101-1I: Paid Online Intermediate Ruby Programming With Database Course</h3>
<p>Como o nome mesmo diz, é um curso intermediário de Ruby voltado a
banco de dados! É um curso pequeno tendo como conteúdo FXRuby, YAML e
Active Record com MySql!</p>
<h3 id="poirpwsc101-1i-paid-online-intermediate-ruby-programming-with-shoes-course">POIRPWSC101-1I: Paid Online Intermediate Ruby Programming With Shoes Course</h3>
<p>Esse é um curso que terá como mentor o
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/ashbb" title="">Satoshi Asakawa</a> e terá o como conteúdo uma
introdução ao Shoes com exemplos e exercícios para fazer! O Satoshi
está indo longe com o Shoes e foi até
<a href="http://newwws.shoooes.net/2008/09/27/the-ashbb-shoes-class.html" title="">citado pelo _why</a>!</p>
<h3 id="poirpc101-paid-online-intermediate-ruby-programming-course">POIRPC101: Paid Online Intermediate Ruby Programming Course</h3>
<p>Curso intermediário de Ruby, sendo o conteúdo: YAML, FXRuby, Unit Testing, Socket Programming  e Threads.</p>
<h3 id="pojrpc101-paid-online-jruby-programming-course">POJRPC101: Paid Online JRuby Programming Course</h3>
<p>Curso abordando um pouco sobre JRuby, mostrando como usar o Jruby em
si, como usar as Classes Java, Programadores Java usando Classes Ruby
e ActiveRecord com JDBC.</p>
<p>Não se preocupem com os preços dos cursos do Rubylearning, pois são
valores simbólicos, geralmente o Satish cobra entre 5 a 10 dólares
pelo PayPal, portanto vale a pena para se manter conectado com o
pessoal que está aprendendo, tendo acesso a material, a fórum e etc.</p>
<p>Os cursos realmente valem a pena! Caso não queira fazer os cursos
pagos então faça ao menos o gratuito sobre o Core que é muito útil
para conhecer mais sobre o Ruby, e se gostar pode pensar nos pagos.</p>

            <description>Para quem não viu o meu post sobre o primeiro dia da Rails Summit, veja aqui! ;) E agora vamos ao segundo post sobre a Rails Summit! :)
Começamos o segundo dia de Rails Summit as 8:00, e logo no começo do dia tivemos alguns probleminhas técnicos com energia elétrica que logo foi contornado com um gerador ( esse evento escala! ). Tivemos a abertura do dia com o Fabio akita comentando sobre as palestras e dando recados gerais.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Para quem não viu o meu post sobre o primeiro dia da Rails Summit,
veja <a href="http://pothix.com/blog/rails/rails-summit-latin-america">aqui</a>! ;)
E agora vamos ao segundo post sobre a Rails Summit! :)</p>
<p>Começamos o segundo dia de Rails Summit as 8:00, e logo no começo do
dia tivemos alguns probleminhas técnicos com energia elétrica que logo
foi contornado com um gerador ( esse evento escala! ). Tivemos a
abertura do dia com o <a href="http://akitaonrails.com" title="">Fabio akita</a>
comentando sobre as palestras e dando recados gerais.</p>
<p>A primeira palestra foi dos caras da <a href="http://phusion.nl" title="">Phusion</a>,
<strong>Hong Li Lai</strong> e <strong>Ninh Bui</strong>, que deram uma palestra muito engraçada
e explicativa sobre o <a href="http://www.modrails.com/" title="">Phusion Passenger</a>.</p>
<p>Eles usaram animações, brincadeiras com a foto do Fabio Akita o que
deixou a palestra muito divertida de ser acompanhada. Também
comentaram sobre como é programar em Rails com várias brincadeiras com
outras linguagens ( cofPHPcof ), comentaram sobre escalabilidade e
outras coisas bem interessantes.</p>
<p>Tudo isso fora o
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/RailsSummit#5259262232498871314" title="">Ninh Bui vestido de Darth Vader</a>. :D</p>
<p>Após isso tivemos a palestra por vídeo conferência do
<a href="http://blog.headius.com/" title="">Charles Nutter</a> e do
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo" title="">Thomas Enebo</a> sobre Jruby.</p>
<p>Infelizmente tivemos alguns problemas técnicos de conexão o que deixou
o nosso audio com um pouco de lag, e cortava um pouco a voz dependendo
do momento, e isso fez com que minha atenção se dispersasse a todo
momento, portanto não tenho muitos comentários para fazer sobre essa
palestra. Mas foi bem interessante, com direito a um pequeno joguinho
com OpenGl rodando.</p>
<p>A partir daqui começa o momento test no Rails Summit, pois a grande
maioria das palestras são sobre tests, o que não é nada mal! :)</p>
<p>Primeiro temos a palestra do <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/">Jay Fields</a>
sobre tests e selenium, onde ele fala bastante sobre a importancia
dos tests para se proteger de antigos bugs que podem voltar ou novos
bugs que podem aparecer quando se implementam novas features.  Ele
comenta um pouco sobre selenium e outras coisas&hellip;Eu recomendo o post do
<a href="http://mergulhao.info/2008/10/16/rails-summit-dia-16-jay-fields">Sylvestre Mergulhão</a>
sobre essa palestra.</p>
<p>Agora temos duas palestras consecutivas do
<a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/" title="">David Chelimsky</a>
(mantenedor do Rspec) no auditório principal enquanto na outra sala
temos <a href="http://blogblogs.com.br" title="">Manuel Lemos</a> e
<a href="http://www.improveit.com.br/empresa/vinicius" title="">Vinucius Teles</a> palestrando
sobre &ldquo;Os desafios de criar um caso de sucesso no Brasil&rdquo; e
&ldquo;Empreendedorismo com RubyOnRails&rdquo; respectivamente.  Tinha que
escolher novamente e preferi escolher as palestrar sobre testes e
assisti as 2 do Chelimsky</p>
<p>O Chelimsky tem uma namorada brasileira, portanto ele consegue falar
um pouco de português, mas ele decidiu dar a palestra em inglês por
não ter fluência.  Na primeira palestra tivemos o conceito de
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development" title="">BDD</a>,
onde você escreve primeiramente os seus testes e eles vão &ldquo;te
lembrando&rdquo; como continuar escrevendo o seu código. Os exemplos dados
pelo Chelimsky foram bem didáticos e interessantes. Vimos User
Stories, e uns exemplos na pratica utilizando Rspec.  Foi passado um
&ldquo;conceito&rdquo; de como fazer testes: Escrever um teste que falha, fazer o
teste passar, refatorar o código procurando pelos famosos &ldquo;Maus
cheiros&rdquo;. Já na segunda palestra ele extendeu a primeira e agora
começou a falar mais sobre o
<a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2008/9/22/cucumber" title="">cucumber</a>, que
parece muito interessante para usar!</p>
<p>Para mudar um pouco eu resolvi ir numa palestra sobre testes ( hehe )
dessa vez foi a palestra do <a href="www.dtsato.com/" title="">Danilo Sato</a> sobre
&ldquo;testes automatizados -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" title="">TDD</a>&rdquo;, onde
ele mostrou algumas ferramentas e deu algumas dicas sobre como ele
começou com testes, sobre dificuldades, vantagens de testar, alguns
problemas que você pode se deparar e possíveis soluções para os
mesmos, comentou sobre os &ldquo;maus cheiros&rdquo; dos testes, fez algumas
recomendações bibliográficas interessante alem de comentar tambem
sobre <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_Object" title="">MOCK</a> e
<a href="http://synthesis.rubyforge.org/" title="">Synthesis</a> tambem.</p>
<p>Agora tivemos a palestra do<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/" title=""> Luis Lavena que é o criador do
One-click-installer para
windows</a>, que veio
falar sobre produtividade trabalhando em rails com windows e outras
questões tendo o windows como base.</p>
<p>Enquanto isso tínhamos uma palestra sobre Jruby com o
<a href="http://fabiokung.com/" title="">Fabio Kung</a> na outra sala.</p>
<p>Nesse momento eu decidi não participar de nenhuma das duas e fiquei
conversando com os Railers que estavam reunidos lá fora prontos para
gravar um vídeo-cast que no fim das contas após mais de 30 minutos de
&ldquo;gravação&rdquo; descobrimos que não estava gravando, portanto a única parte
do vídeo que temos é a apresentação da galera. ¬¬ Mesmo com esse
pequeno problema com a não gravação do vídeo, foi muito interessante
interagir com os Railers e conhecer pessoalmente toda essa galera que
eu só conhecia por nickname ou e-mail.</p>
<p>Tivemos agora uma propaganda da <a href="http://br.sun.com/" title="">Sun</a> (que é
um dos patrocinadores do evento) sobre Open Souce comentando sobre a
plataforma <a href="http://java.com" title="">Java</a>, <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/" title="">OpenSolaris</a>
e outras questões ligadas a Open Souce, que não deixou de ser
interessante! :)</p>
<p>Chegamos ao momento da ultima palestra do evento, dada pelo
<a href="http://obiefernandez.com/" title="">Obie Fernandez</a> (que lembra bastante o
<a href="/images/posts/rails_summit_day2_jack_black.jpg">Jack Black</a> nas fotos),
que foi <strong>muito interessante</strong> !!</p>
<p>O Obie comentou sobre a <a href="http://www.hashrocket.com/" title="">HashRocket</a> e
seus meios de trabalho. Explicou os métodos de desenvolvimento ágil
que eles utilizam, como funcionam os seus meios de negócio, seus meios
de contratação e suas diversões!</p>
<p>Achei muito interessante o meio que ele diz usar para contratar, que é
chamar a pessoa para trabalhar na empresa por uma semana e assim
descobrir se ela é boa mesmo para trabalhar lá ou não. Achei muito
interessante e gostaria que coisas desse tipo tambem funcionasse aqui
no Brasil, mas infelizmente as coisas são bem diferentes por aqui,
tanto por questões contratuais como por outras questões tambem.</p>
<p>Outra coisa que ele comentou que eu achei muito interessante foi o
enfoque em <strong>se divertir</strong> apesar de estar no trabalho, estamos
fazendo o que gostamos e temos que ter bons momentos! Achei legal as
fotos das festas com todo mundo pulando na piscina e tal, acho que
isso que realmente faz uma equipe motivada!</p>
<p>Realmente o Obie fechou com chave de ouro o Rails Summit 2008! :)</p>
<h3 id="considerações-final-da-rails-summit">Considerações final da Rails Summit</h3>
<p>O evento terminou rendendo um <a href="http://github.com/railssummit/morena_opensource/tree/master">projeto no
GitHub</a>
que já tem várias contribuições! :P</p>
<p>Espero que seja o primeiro de muitos e que eu possa estar presente em
todos os subsequentes!</p>
<p>Meus parabéns ao <a href="http://akitaonrails.com" title="">Fabio akita</a> que foi o
organizador principal do evento e correu bastante para que tudo isso
se tornasse realidade!
E parabens a <a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br" title="">Locaweb</a> por contribuir
para esse projeto!</p>

            <description>Como muitos sabem eu participei da Rails Summit Latin America e vou agora fazer uns comentários sobre o evento.
Vou dividir em 2 posts, um para cada dia, por que o assunto ficou bem extenso.
Minha intenção com a Rails Summit, alem de ver as ótimas palestras era de fazer um social network com a galera que eu só conhecia por nickname, e isso realmente foi difícil de fazer justamente por isso, reconhecer as pessoas pessoalmente sendo que só as conheço por nickname e avatar não é nada fácil.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Como muitos sabem eu participei da Rails Summit Latin America e vou
agora fazer uns comentários sobre o evento.</p>
<p>Vou dividir em 2 posts, um para cada dia, por que o assunto ficou
bem extenso.</p>
<p>Minha intenção com a Rails Summit, alem de ver as ótimas palestras era
de fazer um social network com a galera que eu só conhecia por
nickname, e isso realmente foi difícil de fazer justamente por isso,
reconhecer as pessoas pessoalmente sendo que só as conheço por
nickname e avatar não é nada fácil.</p>
<p>Fazendo um pequeno resumo do pessoal que eu queria encontrar e encontrei:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/marcric" title="">Marcos Ricardo</a>
Que tambem é um dos professores assistentes do Rubylearning.org junto
comigo, e só o conhecia pelos foruns do Rubylearning. Essa foi uma
grande oportunidade de conhecê-lo pessoalmente, além de poder tirar
fotos com ele e com o <a href="www.akitaonrails.com" title="">Akita</a> para enviar
para o <a href="http://rubylearning.org/class" title="">Satish Talim</a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dirs" title="">Dirs</a> e <a href="http://twitter.com/mauricio" title="">Mauricio</a>
Dois funcionários da Boo-box que eu conhecia por nome e trabalham aqui perto de mim ( teodoro sampaio ), que por sinal são muito gente boa! =)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arthurgeek.net/" title="">Arthur Zaparolli (arthurgeek)</a>
Conhecia por nome, já troquei e-mail com ele e foi mais um dos contatos que passaram a existir fisicamente! =)</p>
<p><a href="http://rubyonrails.pro.br/" title="">Julio Monteiro</a> (responsável pelo
rubyonrails.pro.br), <a href="http://daviscabral.com.br/" title="">Davis Cabral</a> e
<a href="http://railsbox.org/" title="">Ozeias Santana</a> (responsáveis pelo podcast
Railsbox)
Figuras do mundo Rails que só conhecia por nome e foi
interessante conhecê-los pessoalmente! Galera bem divertida!</p>
<p><a href="http://eustaquiorangel.com/" title="">TaQ</a>
Um figurão que eu conversava pela internet já faz um tempo e tive a
oportunidade de conversar com ele um pouco! Tenho um estilo bem
parecido com o desse cara&hellip;hahaha&hellip;Será que eu vou ser como ele
qunado crescer? hahahahaha</p>
<p><a href="http://akitaonrails.com" title="">Fabio Akita</a>
Já tinha conversado com o Fabio no Google Developers Day e tive a
oportunidade de conversar um pouco com ele na Rails Summit tambem,
apesar de que ele estava bem apressado com a quantidade de coisas que
tinha que se preocupar. :)</p>
<p><a href="http://nomedojogo.com" title="">Carlos Brando</a>
Conversei bem pouco, mas foi interessante conhecer mais um dos caras
influentes no Brasil e responsável (junto com o Akita) pelo
<a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.pro.br/" title="">Rails Podcast Brasil</a>.</p>
<p>Pessoal do <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/aprendendo-rails?hl=en" title="">Aprendendo Rails</a>:
<a href="http://twitter.com/elomar" title="">Elomar França</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/raulsouzalima" title="">Raul Souza Lima (Nihil)</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/juarezpaf" title="">Juarez Filho</a>, William Paixão, <a href="http://twitter.com/freireag" title="">Thiago Freire</a>
Essa galera eu já tive contato pelo aprendendo-rails e estava querendo conhecê-los pessoalmente já faz um tempo.
Elomar França realmente se revelou como um dos grandes palestrantes da Rails Summit, falando sobre Grupos de discussão e aprendizado, onde comentou sobre o aprendendo-rails, o +web e outros grupos no gênero. Com muito humor e irreverência conseguiu mostrar para a galera que grupos é uma ótima forma de aprender&hellip; Parabéns Elomar!
<a href="http://twitter.com/raulsouzalima" title="">Raul</a> tambem é de outro grupo que eu participo que é o <a href="http://groups.google.com.br/group/ruby-sp" title="">ruby-sp</a>, mas eu gostaria de ver mais gente do grupo por lá. **</p>
<p><strong>OBS</strong>: Só depois eu fiquei sabendo que o <a href="http://agaelebe.com" title="">Hugo</a> tambem estava lá! ¬¬
Provavelmente eu esqueci alguem, mas com certeza eu não vou conseguir lembrar de todo mundo! ;)</p>
<p>Bem passando agora por essa parte de pessoal, vamos as palestras e
reviews do evento em si:</p>
<p>Começamos com uma abertura do Fabio Akita e Gilberto Mautner (fundador
da locaweb) comentando sobre o evento, as soluçoes da locaweb, como
ela começou e tudo mais. Foi interessante para conhecer um pouco mais
sobre a locaweb e viajar no tempo vendo o primeiro site deles&hellip;hehe</p>
<p>Deveriamos começar com o <a href="http://chadfowler.com/" title="">Chad Fowler</a>, mas
devido a alguns problemas de horários do
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/about.html" title="">David Heinemeier Hansoon</a>,
a conversa com ele por vídeo conferencia foi adiantada e começamos com
ele antes.  Tivemos uma conversa com O DHH (pois não foi bem uma
palestra), onde ele comentou sobre as novas features do Rails e ficou
aberto a perguntas do pessoal, que eram traduzidas para o ingles se
necessário pelo Fabio Akita.  Surgiram algumas perguntas quanto a
thread safe nativo do Rails 2.2, como ficariam as questões de
internacionalização quanto aos campos com &ldquo;ç&rdquo; e acentos, e todas foram
bem respondidas pelo DHH. Foi interessante ter a oportunidade de
conversar sobre o futuro do Rails.</p>
<p>Após isso tivemos a palestra do <a href="http://chadfowler.com/" title="">Chad Fowler</a> ( que por sinal está bem diferente da foto dele que colocaram na
chamada do evento&hellip;.hehe ), que foi muito interessante!</p>
<p>Ele falou sobre ser &ldquo;remarkable&rdquo;, fez várias comparações com a musica,
o que trazia um bom dinâmismo a palestra.  Achei muito interessante a
colocação dele quando mencionou os níveis de programadores: Iniciante,
iniciante avançado, avançado e expert.  Ele disse que mais de 50% dos
programadores ficam na parte de iniciante avançado e não buscam ir
mais a fundo em sua área de desenvolvimento para realmente ter um
conhecimento mais amplo e profundo sobre o que ele está lidando.  O
Chad tambem comenta sobre projetos Open Source, dizendo para você ser
crítico e reportar o que você vê de errado nos softwares, e melhor do
que isso, como temos todo o código em mãos, podemos contribuir para o
que não gostamos e tornar assim o software melhor.</p>
<p>Na próxima palestra <a href="http://nutrun.com/" title="">George Malamidis</a> e
<a href="http://www.dtsato.com/blog/" title="">Danilo Sato</a> falariam sobre REST e
após assistir o comecinho da palestra eu decidi ver a palestra do
<strong>Fabio Akita</strong>, que ia apresentar o Rails para iniciantes criando uma
pequena aplicação e tudo mais. A palestra foi bem tranquila assim
como todas as palestras de apresentação do Rails com criação de um
pequeno blog e tudo mais, mas achei interessante que ele conseguiu
demonstrar o uso de plugins, e nesse caso ele utilizou o
active_scaffold, e foi bem interessante mostrar o que o Rails pode
fazer rapidamente com plugins.</p>
<p>Terminando a palestra do Akita, enquanto entram na sala o pessoal da
<a href="http://surgeworks.com/" title="">SurgeWorks</a>, que participariam da palestra
do <a href="http://nomedojogo.com" title="">Carlos Brando</a> com o tema &ldquo;Meu emprego
foi para os EUA&rdquo;, o <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/" title="">Dr. Nic Williams</a>
estava começando sua palestra no auditório principal&hellip;</p>
<p>Tinha uma escolha difícil de palestras para fazer, e no fim das contas
decidi assistir a palestra do Carlos, que desde quando ele anunciou o
assunto já me interessei.</p>
<p>A palestra foi bem interessante, e ele comentou por que o trabalho dos
brasileiros é bem cotado lá fora, e como se tornar um bom profissional
para ser contratado, não ser apenas generalista ou apenas
especialista, e sim ser um pouco dos dois, se especializando em algo
mas não deixando de lado outras coisas, criar seu blog e escrever
sobre um determinado assunto para mostrar que você existe e está ali
publicando bom conteúdo, e mostrar seu código para que ele possa ser
avaliado pelas pessoas que possam querer quem sabe lhe contratar.</p>
<p>Além da palestra em si, tivemos um momento muito interessante, que foi
a seção de perguntas e respostas com o pessoal da
<a href="http://surgeworks.com/" title="">SurgeWorks</a>, onde toda a equipe poderia
responder perguntas sobre como é trabalhar para uma empresa do
exterior, e o Carl respondendo como empregador.</p>
<p>Surgiram perguntas muito interessantes que atormentavam muitas pessoas
até hoje. As mais interessantes para mim foram essas:</p>
<h3 id="como-receber">Como receber</h3>
<p>Primeiramente é bem recomendável receber como pessoa jurídica, pois pessoa física paga muitos impostos.
Funciona da seguinte maneira (se estiver errado comente que eu edito, estou fazendo baseado em algumas anotações minhas sobre a palestra):</p>
<ul>
<li>A empresa passa para o banco do brasil de lá</li>
<li>O dinheiro é transferido para o banco do brasil daqui ainda em dólar</li>
<li>Eles entram em contato com o setor cambial do banco para fechar a negociação da taxa de conversão</li>
<li>Depois disso o dinheiro cai na sua conta<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="faculdade-é-importante">Faculdade é importante?</h3>
<p>Essa pergunta foi feita para o Carl e isso me serviu bastante pois tambem tenho essa dúvida.
Carl respondeu que faculdade não é tudo, mas é um diferencial, pois muita coisa não dá para aprender se não tiver um professor ali te forçando a estudar, ou você nunca buscaria isso se realmente não fosse realmente necessário.
Nessa pergunta surgiu uma frase que resume tudo e deixa lição para muitos alunos de faculdade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bons programadores se formam, mas faculdade não forma grandes programadores</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agora é a hora do Keynote do <a href="http://errtheblog.com/" title="">Chris Wanstrath</a>, que pareceu um pouco nervoso, e eu não tenho muito o que comentar
pois pode ser lido no <a href="http://gist.github.com/6443" title="">keynote dele</a>. (obrigado pelo link <a href="http://dirceu.info/blog" title="">Dirceu</a>).</p>
<p>Agora temos uma das partes mais divertidas do evento, que foi o
momento desconferência, que foi nomeado &ldquo;Birds of Feather&rdquo;.
Infelizmente não vou lembrar o nome de toda a galera que apresentou
algo na parte de Birds of Feather, mas se você apresentou, ou souber
quem apresentou, por favor comente! =)</p>
<p>Tivemos vários assuntos de todos os gostos: interessantes, curiosos,
informativos, engraçados e etc&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Um que achei bem interessante foi sobre um projeto de impressora fiscal feito em Ruby, que não era web e sim desktop utiliando GTK ( quase certeza ), mas achei bem legal o conceito.</li>
<li>Outro que achei curioso foi o projeto do <a href="http://www.phusion.nl/about.html" title="">Ninh Bui (Phusion)</a> que é um &ldquo;compilador <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" title="">Brainfuck</a> &gt; ruby&rdquo; que pega um código brainfuck, transforma em ruby e executa&hellip;.haha</li>
<li>Outro projeto interessante que foi apresentado pelo cara do <a href="http://www.pagestacker.com/br/home" title="">pagestacker</a> (desculpa não lembrar seu nome) foi o footnotes-debug que é utilizado para ajudar no debug de aplicações rails. Ele cria um pequeno footer na sua página com vários links úteis para o debug, como: mostrar cookies, abrir código (apenas para Mac com textmate) e outras coisas que não me lembro de momento.</li>
<li>Um projeto que me animou bastante foi o projeto apresentado pelo <a href="http://www.demetriusnunes.com/" title="">demetrius nunes</a> sobre <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gosu/" title="">GOSU</a> para programação de jogos em Ruby! Sempre tive vontade de desenvolver jogos, e já ouço falar de Python para isso faz um tempo, mas não conhecia nada até entao para brincar com Ruby, portanto me deixou bem animado.</li>
<li>O <a href="http://mergulhao.info/" title="">Silvestre Mergulhao</a> apresentou um projeto bem interessante de uso de bluetooth com Ruby e me atraiu bastante a atenção tambem pois bluetooth está na minha lista de coisas para brincar. ;)</li>
<li>E para fechar com chave de ouro meus comentários sobre o Birds of Feather, temos o <a href="http://maisweb.org/blogdoelomar/" title="">Elomar França</a> que falou sobre grupos de estudo. Com certeza o Elomar foi a grande revelaçao do Rails Summit, pois ele conseguiu apresentar de uma maneira bem divertida como os grupos de discussão podem ajudar no seu aprendizado, assim citando o +web que é o grupo que ele cordena na sua cidade, e o aprendendo-rails que é o grupo que ele participa cuja finalidade com ele mesmo diz &ldquo;é bem fácil de se notar&hellip;.aprender rails&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bem&hellip;.E assim acaba o primeiro dia de Rails Summit! Estou terminando
um post sobre o segundo dia e publicarei daqui a um ou dois dias. :)</p>
<p>Enquanto isso vocês podem ver os posts dos das pessoas que citei, pois
quase todos eles postaram várias informações em seus blogs.  Destaque
para o <a href="http://mergulhao.info/" title="">Silvestre Mergulhao</a> e o
<a href="http://akitaonrails.com/2008/10/20/rails-summit-sucesso-comunidade" title="">Fabio Akita</a>
que postaram muita coisa interessante.</p>
<p>Para quem quiser ver fotos eu coloquei todas as minhas no
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/RailsSummit" title="">meu Picasa</a>.</p>

            <description>Pouco tempo atrás comprei um notebook Toshiba U405-S2854 e instalei o Slackware 12.0 (não tinha baixado o 12.1 ainda) com fluxbox nele e aproveitei para brincar de compilar o Kernel e conhecer outras coisas&amp;hellip;
Percebi que meus conhecimentos não estavam bons o suficiente para eu fazer tudo o que eu queria com meu Slack em um curto espaço de tempo, infelizmente, e portanto resolvi instalar outro linux mais facil para eu usar enquanto meu slackware não fica do jeito que eu quero.</description>

<a href="http://explore.toshiba.com/laptops/satellite/U400/U405-S2854">Toshiba U405-S2854</a>
e instalei o Slackware 12.0 (não tinha baixado o 12.1 ainda) com
fluxbox nele e aproveitei para brincar de compilar o Kernel e conhecer
outras coisas&hellip;</p>
<p>Percebi que meus conhecimentos não estavam bons o suficiente para eu
fazer tudo o que eu queria com meu Slack em um curto espaço de tempo,
infelizmente, e portanto resolvi instalar outro linux mais facil para
eu usar enquanto meu slackware não fica do jeito que eu quero.</p>
<p>Resolvi instalar o Ubuntu (mantendo meu Slackware em outra particão)
tanto para conhecer, pois eu ainda não tinha usado, quanto para
facilitar uso do meu notebook enquanto eu posso brincar com Slackware
livremente quanto eu tiver tempo para diversão&hellip;hehe</p>
<p>Gostei bastante do Ubuntu, achei bonitinho com várias features dele,
sendo a mais interessante a do zoom que eu já achava muito legal
quando eu via no Mac.</p>
<p>Agora vou deixar meu ambiente de desenvolvimento OK novamente! =)</p>
<p>Vou começar a fazer alguns posts sobre Ubuntu tambem, tanto em
multimedia como em desenvolvimento, e terão posts mesclados entre
minhas 2 distros.</p>
<p>Aguardem! ;)</p>

            <description>Bem, como primeiro post vou me apresentar e dizer qual o meu intuito com esse blog.
Lembro muito bem da época que associava blog com os &amp;ldquo;flogão&amp;rdquo; da vida e prometia para mim mesmo que eu nunca criaria um blog para mim. Com a mudança de rumo dos blogs a minha vontade de criar um para divulgar informação útil foi crescendo, mas eu me mantinha preso aquela velha promessa, até que mês passado eu consegui me livrar disso e decidi finalmente ingressar no ramo de blog, pois eu pesquiso e leio tanta coisa que provavelmente algum dos conhecimentos que tenho ou coisas que fiz serão úteis para mais alguem.</description>

finalmente ingressar no ramo de blog, pois eu pesquiso e leio tanta
coisa que provavelmente algum dos conhecimentos que tenho ou coisas
que fiz serão úteis para mais alguem.</p>
<p>O foco desse blog é principalmente compartilhar informações úteis
sobre desenvolvimento, Linux e eventos de tecnologia, mas de vez em
quando postarei algumas coisas de Nerd para não perder o costume. ;)</p>
<p>Acho que já está bom para um primeiro post, não!?</p>
<p>Se quiser mais informações sobre mim procure na seção sobre do site.</p>
