<p>I usually don&rsquo;t count how many books I read, I just track and check at
the end of the month. When I saw that I read five books read this
month, my face was like 😱. All of them received a 4-star review, so
the result is quite good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2LdZT3q">Managing Oneself</a>: This is a great
book. It&rsquo;s not life-changing, but there are many great tips to
improve your life. It was almost 5 stars for me. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1622218584">Check my review to
find my notes</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2uuv1RO">A Filosofia Explica as Grandes Questões da
Humanidade</a>: This book is in pt-BR, if you
speak Portuguese and want a light (and quite funny) introduction to
philosophy book, this may be the one.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Jm6rZ2">The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There
Are No Easy Answers</a>: A good book for
CTOs. It was also an excellent reading for me since I saw many of those
problems happening during my career 😅. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m the
right audience, but it&rsquo;s a good book overall. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2285173161">Here is my review and
notes</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to2NT4qXs">Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind
How Video Games Are Made</a>: If you like
games, especially what is under the hood (not just to play them) you
will have a good time reading this book. I&rsquo;m a big fan of games and
always try to build my own just for fun. The gaming industry is
tough, you will understand why by reading this book.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NSlbCf">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the
Future</a>: A good one but I think I had high expectations. I recommend reading anyway, especially if you want to build a startup in the future (or already have one).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a full review for all books I read. Sometimes I
mention some of them here, but you can find all of them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my
Goodreads account</a>.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m still experimenting with <a href="https://ifttt.com/p/pothix">an integration between Pocket and Google
Spreadsheets via IFTTT</a>. I&rsquo;m adding a tag
to the articles I read and want to include in my list of <em>articles
read</em> for the month.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/pocket-articles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/pocket-articles.png" alt="Articles read this month" title="Articles read this month"></a></p>
<p>I use a <code>SUMIF</code> to sum all lines containing the YEARMONTH tag and it
shows I got <strong>27 articles read</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare this with the old method:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1539,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:2.47,&quot;read&quot;:1146,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.36}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1573,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:2.16,&quot;read&quot;:1173,&quot;read_pct&quot;:2.3}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1573 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1173 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1539 unread</strong>
and <strong>1146 read</strong>), I got around <strong>2.16% more unread articles</strong> and
<strong>2.3% more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>1173 <em>(read this month)</em> - 1146 <em>(read prev. month)</em> = <strong>27</strong> <em>(the number in the spreadsheet)</em></p>
<p>It seems my spreadsheet tracking is working as expected. 🎉 I have to
think if it&rsquo;s a good thing to lose the number of articles added, but
I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s bringing that much value in the current
situation.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Emacs is superior this month. I don&rsquo;t remember seeing any uptrend during the month though. 🤔</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than the other months. It&rsquo;s interesting to see that Sunday
was one of the days I programmed the most. 🤔 Usually, it&rsquo;s related to
my presentations (rehearsing live coding) or writing this blog post,
which makes <code>markdown</code> to be on the top of the list of languages. 😅</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>And now we have a surprise! <strong>Rust</strong> is the most used language this
month with <strong>more than 32% of my usage</strong>. 😱</p>
<p>The reason for that is my gaming with Rust presentation this month. I
plan to do some live coding, in the same way, I did for Python,
Javascript, and Ruby in the past. It is taking almost all my spare
time, but it&rsquo;s also a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Thanks to my monthly posts and lengthy posts on
<a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> (that I write in Emacs), <strong>Markdown</strong> is
in the second position.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong> is my first language nowadays and <strong>Ruby</strong> is used when I
work as a freelancer full-stack developer (for the same company, for
more than 2 years now).</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>This month I spoke about the same topic as <a href="https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br">my
book</a> at <a href="https://www.sympla.com.br/desconstruindo-a-web__262326">Impacta
tecnologia</a>.</p>
<p>Still related to this presentation: this month also marks the
milestone of 1000 copies of my book sold, which is incredible. I promised
to write about it, hope to have a post soon.</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p>This time I could take the screenshot at the right time so we can
compare. It seems stable, but I can see an improvement there. It is quite unreliable to use the number of tasks as it can be &ldquo;drink water&rdquo; or &ldquo;implement a complex system&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m OK with that. 😀</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>1 days and 8 hours</strong> of podcast time. A little bit less than the last month, but as usual, the decrease of time listening Podcast correlates a lot with the number of books read (listen). 👍</p>
<p>Here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely comfortable with this list. It doesn&rsquo;t tell a true story. I listen to many good and small podcasts, and they are not part of this list because the long ones usually take their place. As an example, I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping this list here because it shows some of the Podcasts I
follow, but I will probably find the best way to do that. I will
probably export a file every month and post it here. 👍</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software
(<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a>) comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>June 21st I was at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pt/summits/sao-paulo/">AWS Summit São Paulo 2018</a>.</p>
<p>I had 19 work days tracked this month, and I worked for 160 hours,
which mean that <strong>I worked 8 hours more than I should</strong> (more than I
had last month, which was 5 hours). It&rsquo;s quite bad since I worked 1
day more than I should. <strong>The goal is to reach 8 hours and remove
those bars that exceed the 9h threshold</strong>. Currently, it&rsquo;s not a huge
problem, but I want to be able to stabilize it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>Last month I was discussing each item of the Deep work, but I will get
back to discussing Shallow work only since it&rsquo;s what concerns me the
most. Deep work is useful, sometimes it&rsquo;s not coding, but it&rsquo;s related
and meaningful work.</p>
<p>For shallow work, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meeting time</strong> is stable (and productive), considering two 1-1
meetings (1 hour each) and four weekly meetings (around 40 minutes
each)</li>
<li><strong>Read/Reply Twist</strong> is stable but still consuming much time,
more than 2 hours every day.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch/Break</strong> is now complete! I&rsquo;m spending around 26 hours in
lunch/break. Considering that I had 19 days of work, it&rsquo;s less than
1.5 hours. I should stop and stretch more than I&rsquo;m doing now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check the Twist usage by hour (previous month first, this month
after):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a></p>
<p>No significant changes, and as I said in my previous review, I&rsquo;m not that
satisfied with this chart. The perfect chart for me would have a small
peak at 9-10, almost no usage between 10-13, a giant peak between 14
and 16 and less usage from 16 to 21. That performance is what would be more
productive to me according to the <a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf">daily when
tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue with my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>What an improvement! It&rsquo;s probably related to my presentation since I&rsquo;m
rehearsing it a lot. 😅</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>My pulse is worst this month. I&rsquo;m still tracking my Telegram usage since it&rsquo;s the most used application of the <em>Very distracting</em>
category. Here is the comparison from the previous month to the
current one:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>

<p>It seems the usage increased. I don&rsquo;t know why yet.</p>
<p>Comparing Telegram usage by time of the day, we have (last month
first, <strong>this month second</strong>):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that used in my peak times, but it seems to be the opposite
of Twist usage. I have to work on that.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>

<p>This month I have almost <strong>8k steps</strong> compared to 7k from the previous month. 🎉</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check my weight:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice, but it doesn&rsquo;t show what I want. If you look by the 90 days
perspective using <a href="https://myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a>, we have a
better picture of that:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight-myfitnesspal.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight-myfitnesspal.png" alt="Weight in the last 90 days via MyFitnessPal" title="Weight in the last 90 days via MyFitnessPal"></a></p>
<p>My plan to lose a little bit of weight is finally on the way. 👍</p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Good to see it&rsquo;s improving every month. 🙃</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a>, I watched just 1
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably related to the last episode of <strong>Sense 8</strong>.</p>
<p>I forgot to get my data from <a href="https://trakt.tv">trakt.tv</a> at the beginning of this month. The current version already includes some other TV shows. I will keep last month&rsquo;s version here for reference.</p>
<p>[<img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows-trakt.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to trakt" title="TV shows watched this month according to trakt">](/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows-trakt.jpg &ldquo;)</p>
<p>The most important part is in blue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TV Shows</strong>: 31d 22h 50m</li>
<li><strong>Movies</strong>: 10d 15h 22m</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>47147</strong> words written (<strong>38747</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>595</strong> corrections made (<strong>385</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>10973</strong> unique words (<strong>11213</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that I&rsquo;m writing more but not with a better vocabulary 😞. I&rsquo;m
not sure if it&rsquo;s related to the fact that I&rsquo;m not tracking everything
I type in <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> anymore. 🤔</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the previous and this month, the previous first and
<strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data this month" title="General view of my locations data this month"></a></p>
<p>One new city popped out, and according to Google locations, it&rsquo;s São Paulo 🤔.</p>
<p>A little bit more time in a vehicle. It seems that I&rsquo;m getting out of
the cavern more nowadays 😅</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance this month" title="Location time and distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Still many kilometers to &ldquo;reach the moon&rdquo;:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💰</p>
<p>This month I spend 29% of my earnings, which is still below my
expectations (40%). This 29% are distributed into the following
categories (in pt-BR):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jun/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jun/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>I see more general expenses (<em>Compras</em>) than I would like. Gifts and
donations ( <em>Presentes / Doações</em>) are quite high this month because
of my parents in law health insurance. I decided to add it to the
<em>donations</em> category because I&rsquo;m already using the Family one
(<em>Família / Filhos</em>) to track the expenses with my dog. 😅</p>
<p>We spent a lot with Doctors and medicines this month (<em>Saúde</em>), but I hope it
will not be a recurrent expense.</p>
<p>My total savings <strong>increased by 1.32%</strong> this month, and now I have
<strong>95.35%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important metric to understand if it worth taking the time to
write it. So:</p>
<p><strong>It took 3 hours and 40 minutes to write it</strong></p>
<p>It was a good time considering my average. 🎉</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It was quite hard to take the time to write down this post, but I&rsquo;m
glad I did it. I feel excellent when I read my accomplishments every
month. ☺</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>
