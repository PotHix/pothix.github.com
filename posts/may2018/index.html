        <p>It&rsquo;s May, and it&rsquo;s time for metrics! 📊</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>Two books read this month, but both received a 3 stars review:
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2xEnPaM">Wait, What?: And Life&rsquo;s Other Essential
Questions</a>: Exactly what the author says in
the beginning: It&rsquo;s a lecture that became a book. Not bad, but
OK-ish.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Jozn6t">Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry into the Value of
Work</a>: More political views than I was
expecting and the pacing is not so good. The motorcycles part
resonates with me a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a full review for each book I read. You can find
them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my Goodreads account</a>.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m experimenting with <a href="https://ifttt.com/p/pothix">an integration between Pocket and Google
Spreadsheets via IFTTT</a>. The idea is not
to use Javascript codes anymore, but it&rsquo;s still ongoing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding a tag to the articles I read and want to include in my list
of <em>articles read</em> for the month. For this month, I&rsquo;m using the tag
<code>201805</code>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/pocket-articles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/pocket-articles.png" alt="Articles read this month" title="Articles read this month"></a></p>
<p>I use a <code>SUMIF</code> to sum all lines containing the string <code>201805</code>, and
got <strong>26 articles read</strong>.</p>
<p>I did not start at the beginning of the month, and it should be
considered just an experiment for now. I hope to soon change to this
method of collecting data about the articles read.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s worth keeping the old method:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1501,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:3.66,&quot;read&quot;:1096,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.2}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1539,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:2.47,&quot;read&quot;:1146,&quot;read_pct&quot;:4.36}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1539 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1146 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1501 unread</strong>
and <strong>1096 read</strong>), I got around <strong>2.47% more unread articles</strong> and
<strong>4.36% more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>Still adding more than reading (😕), but I&rsquo;m still not sure if this is
a problem. I may never read all those articles I marked to <em>read
later</em>, but does it really matter? 🤔</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Nothing new here, 70-30 between Vim and Emacs.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Not that bad.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is back as the first language because of some big posts I
had to write using Emacs. <strong>Python</strong> is the second most used language
because of <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> and
<a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a>, and <strong>Ruby</strong> is still present there 😉.</p>
<p>This month I had a little bit of <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Go</strong>, which is nice. I think I
will have more Rust next month. 😀</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>No talks this month as well 😕, but one scheduled for the next month. 👍</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p>Things are better this month! Hope to remember to take the screenshot
before the week cycle ends next month.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days and 18 hours</strong> of podcast time. Here is the list of Podcasts
and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this list is based on time. <code>Anticast</code> is not a Podcast
I&rsquo;m used to listening, but they have some good episodes from time to
time. The problem is that they are quite long (~1h30) while other
shows tend to have episodes of about 30min.</p>
<p>Well, keep in mind that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking
time instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear
as &ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>I had 21 work days tracked this month, and I worked for 173 hours,
which mean that <strong>I worked 5 hours more than I should</strong> (the same as I
had in April). Not bad but <strong>the goal is to reach 8 hours and remove
those bars that exceed the 9h threshold</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>I decided to track my <em>lunch/break time</em>, so I can understand how much
time I&rsquo;m spending on tasks that are not related to work at all
(reading emails, talking to people via Telegram, etc.). Unfortunately,
I started this too late. I have only 10 hours of lunch break so we
will have to skip it to the next month.</p>
<p>I have to be more descriptive with Deep work. I&rsquo;m trying to keep
<em>Writing</em> and <em>Read/Reply Twist</em> as the same thing, maybe it will be
better next month. I&rsquo;m also stunned by the small number tracked as
deep work <em>coding</em>. This month I spent far more time discussing and
writing things down than actually coding. 😕</p>
<p>For shallow work, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meeting time</strong> is stable (and productive), considering two 1-1
meetings (1 hour each) and four weekly meetings (around 40 minutes
each)</li>
<li><strong>Read/Reply Twist</strong> is still consuming a lot of time, more than 2
hours every day.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch/Break</strong> is still work in progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m looking into all the data, I found it interesting that
<strong>1/3 of my time is spent communicating</strong>. 🤔</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check the Twist usage by hour (previous month first, this month
after):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png" alt="Twist usage by time of the day" title="Twist usage by time of the day"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that satisfied with this chart. The perfect chart for me would
have a small peak at 9-10, almost no usage between 10-13, a giant peak
between 14 and 16 and less usage from 16 to 21. I should have no usage
after 21.</p>
<p>The usage I described above is precisely the opposite of what is my
productive time. I used the <a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf">daily when
tracker</a>
and found the times I&rsquo;m more alert and energetic. As usual, I should
post about it as well but never do. 😕</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely better! We should consider the holiday for this month,
though. 😛</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>My productivity pulse is better this month. <a href="/post/stats-may-2018/">Last
month</a> I did some research on what happened and
found that Magic the Gathering was taking a lot of my time and also
adding some outliers, it seems to be better now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still following my Telegram usage, here is the comparison from the
previous month to the current one:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>

<p>It seems to be better but not much. I have an alert of my time spent
using Telegram, but when it fires, it&rsquo;s usually too late. Working on
it.</p>
<p>Comparing Telegram usage by time of the day, we have (last month
first, this month second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>It improved a little bit during my peak times. I will consider that as
an improvement and keep working on it.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>

<p>This month I have <strong>7k steps</strong> compared to 8k from the previous month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back to the gym, but my weight is still the same. I hope to have a
big improvement next month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>Better sleeping! That&rsquo;s good news! 🙃</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 8
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>These episodes are related to the new season of <strong>13 reasons why</strong> and
<strong>The End of the F***ing world</strong>.</p>
<p>I mentioned that I&rsquo;m trying <a href="https://trakt.tv">trakt.tv</a>, and I&rsquo;m
still getting used to it. This is what I&rsquo;m going to use:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/tvshows-trakt.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/tvshows-trakt.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to trakt" title="TV shows watched this month according to trakt"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, I can also track movies. The only data that matters is
the following:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/trakt-stats.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/trakt-stats.jpg" alt="Trakt.tv stats this month" title="Trakt.tv stats"></a></p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m still missing some movies and TV shows there, hope to add
them as soon as I remember.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>38747</strong> words written (<strong>61385</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>385</strong> corrections made (<strong>934</strong> last month)</li>
<li><strong>11213</strong> unique words (<strong>16473</strong> last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grammarly is not working good inside Twist anymore, I don&rsquo;t know
why. I will have to reach out to Grammarly again soon.</p>
<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added some places to the list:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-places.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-places.png" alt="Places I visited" title="Places I visited"></a></p>
<p>Other than that, no new cities or countries. 😞</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the previous and this month, the previous first and
<strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data this month" title="General view of my locations data this month"></a></p>
<p>One new city popped out, but I have no idea which one it is. Maybe it
is the lost city from the last report. 🤷‍♂</p>
<p>My time commuting improved a lot this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/apr/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance this month" title="Location time and distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Still many kilometers to &ldquo;reach the moon&rdquo;:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💰</p>
<p>This month I spend 32% of my earnings, which is still below my
expectations (40%). This 32 % are distributed into the following
categories (in pt-BR):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/may/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/may/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>We spent more with <em>Mercado</em> (groceries) than expected (last month it
was just 3%), hope to adjust it for the next month.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m not considering the money in transit from my company to
my personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant
payment, etc.).  So, without considering it, my total savings
<strong>increased by 0.06%</strong>. This is a good number given the current
scenario of the Brazilian economy (it&rsquo;s positive because I added
money, or it would be negative), and now I have <strong>94.11%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important metric to understand if it worth taking the time to
write it. So:</p>
<p><strong>It took 5 hours and 12 minutes to write it</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more than I expected, but I think it&rsquo;s happening because I was
researching different services and also doing some research on how to
conduct my investments. Hope to decrease this time next month.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It took a lot of time to write this post, and this is bad, but other
than that, the month was good in general. All my goals for this month
were met, so I have nothing to complain. ✌</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>
