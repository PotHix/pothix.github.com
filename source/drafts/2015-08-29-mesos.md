I've attended [OSCON](http://pothix.com) this year and saw a lot of
`presentations on orchestrators like [Kubernetes]() and
[Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org). We were planning to try Mesos at Locaweb for a
long time and that day came now.

For those who doesn't know Mesos yet, it is considered the OS for the
datacenter. Its main idea is to make all the resources on the datacenter
available as a single and big machine.
