Today I was reading [Quora](http://quora.com) as I do every day and I found [this
question](http://www.quora.com/Careers-in-Computer-Programming/Why-are-all-software-engineers-so-frustrated-about-their-job-in-spite-of-being-well-paid)
about "Why software engineers are so frustrated in spite of being well paid" and
there are some interesting views about it that makes a lot of sense.
