This year my proposal to speak at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) was accepted and I
spoke at the Desktop devroom! :)

It was my first talk in English, so I decided to do as many rehearsals as I
could. I was 8 in total, but as expected, it was still ahead of time. :P

I had 30 minutes (including questions) to present and I did it in 26. I usually
speak fast and this presentation **was made to be fast** because I had a lot of
content to show in 30 minutes. So, **it was FAST** (even more than what I was
expecting). LOL

I'm OK with the final result. It's far from being my best presentation but it's
the first one in a different language, so it's acceptable. 

They already published the video for my presentation, and it
is [available here](). 
And [here is the link for the slides]().

FOSDEM was great, can't wait for the next! :)
