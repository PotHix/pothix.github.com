This year my proposal to speak at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) was accepted and I
spoke at the Desktop devroom! :)

It was my first talk in English, so I decided to do as many rehearsals as I
could. I was 8 in total, but as expected, it was still a little bit faster than
expected. :P

I had 30 minutes to present and I did it in 26. I usually speak fast and this
presentation **was made to be fast** because I had a lot of content to show in
30 minutes. So, **it was FAST** (even more than what I was expecting). LOL

I'm OK with the final result. It's far from being my best presentation but it's
the first one in a different language, so it's acceptable. 

They already published the video for my presentation, and it
is [available here](https://video.fosdem.org/2017/K.4.401/) as
*desktops_open_source_behind_web_request*.

In case you want more information about the presentation, including the slides,
you may want to check its page
on
[FOSDEM Schedule](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/desktops_open_source_behind_web_request/).

FOSDEM was great, can't wait for the next! :)
