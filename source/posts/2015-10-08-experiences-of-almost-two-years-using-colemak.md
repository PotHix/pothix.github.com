TL;DR: I like colemak, and it is a *very good* layout. I found some equivalent
pros and cons, so I can't recommend it to anyone without a little bit of
philosophy. :)

For those who don't know [Colemak](http://colemak.com/), it is a keyboard layout
created to make the most used keys stay in the home row as well as make you
swipe between your right and left hand.

Here is a
[keyboard layouts heatmap](http://www.patrick-wied.at/projects/heatmap-keyboard/)
for you to understand the benefits of using a keyboard layout that was designed
to help you to be confortable and fast when typing instead of one that
[helping the operator to not jam the typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY).
I tried some code (python), English and Portuguese texts and it looks almost the
same on the heatmap.

I'm using Colemak since Dec, 25 of 2013 and here are come pros and cons that I
found:

The first con is that I don't know how to type fast on qwerty anymore, now I'm
typing as I never saw a qwerty layout before. The problem is that everyone uses
this crappy layout and sometimes you need to use it to write and it makes you
look like a granpa. The good part is that I almots don't need to use qwerty, all
devices that belog to me I've changed to colemak (computers, cellphones and so
on), so I just need to use qwerty when I'm typing on other peoples devices.

A pro is that my typing speed grew from an average of 75 WPM to almost 100
WPM. I need to consider that I also bought a Kinesis Advantage Pro;

"Kinesis Advantage")

Without this keyboard I'm not that fast. Just tried
[10fastfingers now and got 92 WPM](http://10fastfingers.com/user/504663/) using
my laptop's keyboard.

Another pro is that I really feel confortable using Colemak, you the same way as
being an experienced Vim user, looks like you don't need to type so much. :)

Now, talking about Vim... I'm an experienced Vim user, but Vim is totally
coupled with qwerty layout. I tried to remap some keys (like hjkl for example)
in order to keep using the home row to navigate but it was not very good. Totay
I'm just using plain colemak layout on Vim and it is not so good as it was on
qwerty. For this reason I decided to try a new editor and I'm using Emacs
now. :)

It took me at least a month to get back to my old typing speed, I was training
everyday on 10fastfinges to get used to the layout. In the beginning you may
feed some headaches because of the mind remapping. It's not so easy to change
something that you thought was the only way of getting things done. It was a
great challenge for me and it just seems right, I don't wanna use a keyboard
layout that was made to avoid jams on a typewriter, Jesus, we're in 2015 and
there is not typewriters anymore.

Hope this post helps a lot of colemak newcommers and the only thing I could say
about my journey is that **I would do it again if I could**. :)
