Hi international friends! :)

I'm just posting to inform that I want to post some content in English
too! I'll try to make a RSS Feed only for my English posts, so you
don't need to view my portuguese posts on your feed reader. :)

As everyone knows, my English is not so good, but I think you can
understand me well! Any English errors (I'm sure it will have a lot of
them) please tell me and I'll correct it asap.

Hope to have you following this blog! :)
