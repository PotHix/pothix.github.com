Ã†!!

Hi International friends! :)

I'm just posting to inform that i want to post some content in english too! I'll try to make a RSS Feed only for my english posts, so you can't need to view my portuguese posts on your Reader. :)

Everybody knows that my english is not so good, but i think that you can understand me! Any english errors ( i think that i'll have a lot of errors...:P ) please tell me and i'll correct the text.

I'll update this post when i have the link to RSS to english posts! :D

See you!
