Just a transcript from [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlZ4ONTb9i0&feature=youtu.be), 
but it reflects my way of life at this stage of my life:

    We believe in going our own way,no matter which way the rest of the world is going.

    We believe in bucking the system that’s built to smash individuals as bugs on a windshield.

    Some of us believe in the man upstairs.All of us believe in sticking in to the man down here.

    We believe in the sky and we don’t believe in the sunroof.

    We believe in freedom.

    We believe in dust,tumbleweeds,buffalo,mountain ranges and riding off into the sunset.

    We believe in saddle bags and we believe that cowboys had it right.

    We believe in refusing to knuckle under to anyone.

    We believe in wearing black,because it doesn’t show any dirt or weakness.

    We believe the world is going soft and we’re not going along with it.

    We believe in motorcycle rallies that last a week.

    We believe in road side attractions,gas station,hot dogs and finding what’s over the next.

    We believe in rumbling engines,pistons the size of garbage cans,fuel tanks designed in 1936, freight-train size headlights,chrome and custom paint.
    
    We believe in flames and skulls.
    
    We believe life is what you make it,and we make it one hell of a ride.

    We believe the machine you sit on can tell the world exactly where you stand.

    We don’t care what everyone else believes.
