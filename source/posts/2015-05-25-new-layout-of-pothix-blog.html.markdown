Welcome to the new blog layout of PotHix.com! :)

I decided that the time has came to change not just the layout but the blog
engine as well. I'm now using middleman instead of wordpress. Just to be clear,
I don't think wordpress is not good at all, but I want to publish static files
instead of keeping the wordpress "infrastructure".

I've divided into 3 feeds:

* Only english posts: http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix
* All posts: http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix
* Posts related to programming or technology in genenal: http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech

So, that's it! Hope you enjoy the new layout (now responsive!) and get in touch! :)
