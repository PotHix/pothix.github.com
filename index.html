The need I currently have a Kinesis Advantage at home. The keyboard is great, probably the best keyboard I used so far, but it&rsquo;s far from what we can call portable ðŸ˜….</p>

My year in review for 2018 was never posted because I could never finish it. I don&rsquo;t want to let the same thing happen this year, so here I am.
The end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was quite hard for me and me just didn&rsquo;t have the energy to sit down in front of the computer during the weekends to write my monthly reviews.</p>

Even with the small problems we had (as any other big conference), the feedback we received so far were very positive. We were able to bring amazing speakers to the conference, which brought high-level content even for beginners.</p>

                    <p>I just bought an Atreus keyboard and I&rsquo;m now configuring my own firmware.
To do that, I&rsquo;m using the qmk_firmware.
I&rsquo;m adding a new file as a layout (link here) and I have to change tmk_core/common/avr/bootloader.c to be able to compile it:
-uint32_t reset_key __attribute__ ((section (&quot;.noinit&quot;))); +uint32_t reset_key __attribute__ ((section (&quot;.noinit,\&quot;aw\&quot;,@nobits;&quot;))); After that, I just had to get the keyboard to the reset mode via fn + ESC (to change the layout) and then pressed the RESET button.</p>

Books I usually don&rsquo;t count how many books I read, I just track and check at the end of the month. When I saw that I read five books read this month, my face was like ðŸ˜±. All of them received a 4-star review, so the result is quite good.

 Managing Oneself: This is a great book. It&rsquo;s not life-changing, but there are many great tips to improve your life.</p>

Books Two books read this month, but both received a 3 stars review: 
 Wait, What?: And Life&rsquo;s Other Essential Questions: Exactly what the author says in the beginning: It&rsquo;s a lecture that became a book. Not bad, but OK-ish. Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry into the Value of Work: More political views than I was expecting and the pacing is not so good.</p>

A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy. This book was on my reading list for many months now. After reading it, I realized I&rsquo;m practicing a fraction of Stoicism for many years.</p>
