          <p>I had to chance to go to travel to NYC more than once. The first time
I came there alone and the second one I went with my wife and both
trips were good.</p>
<h2 id="airport">Airport</h2>
<p>I always try to go to JFK because it&rsquo;s the biggest and simplest
airport to use. The airport is really big and they have a train called
Airtrain, that can be used to go from one terminal to another and also
connects to the Subway.</p>
<h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>
<p>The transportation in New York is amazingly practical (but dirty). I
was able to use the subway to go anywhere I wanted. There are stations
almost everywhere.</p>
<p>I would recommend you to buy a weekly pass for the Subway so you don&rsquo;t
have to keep track of your credit. Believe me, if you&rsquo;re planning to
visit many touristic places, it will worth your money (yes, I do the
math every time before buying something). It costs around $30 (as of
mid-2019) and if you consider 1 round trip from e.g. Brooklyn and one
trip here and there it would be worthwhile.</p>
<p>Be careful with the side you&rsquo;re going to enter in the subway. Where I
live (São Paulo, Brazil) you can enter on whatever entrance and then
pick the side you want (e.g. Noath or South). In NYC you have to be
sure you&rsquo;re entering in the right entrance because <strong>some</strong> stations
have one entrance for each side (e.g. one entrace to go to Manhatan &amp;
the Bronx, and another one to go to Downtown Brooklyn).</p>
<h2 id="places-to-visit">Places to visit</h2>
<p>There are some places that are must see (IMO) and others that are nice
but OK. Here are the must see and why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statue of Liberty</strong>: I almost not went there for the first time
because it seemed too crowded and was &lsquo;just a statue&rsquo;. In the end I
decided to go and the whole experience proved me wrong. It&rsquo;s not
just a statue, the whole story behind it is really nice to know. It
worth the money you pay to go there. The entrance to the pedestal is
still a puzzle for me. I got it the second time I went but not the
first, I don&rsquo;t know why. I would recommend you to ask for it or do
some research before. If you want to go to the crown of the statue,
you have to reserve it beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Transit museum</strong>: I really like steam engines and the whole
history about trains. The transit museum has a lot to tell about the
NYC subway. It was really nice to understand why the subway work
that way.</li>
<li><strong>Natural history musuem</strong>: The first time I went there, I was one
of the first visitors to enter and left when the museum was
closing. It&rsquo;s a big place with so many amazing things to see. I
would recommend going there early and going straight to the
dinosaurs room because it&rsquo;s the most crowded. After that you can
enjoy the museum on your own pace.</li>
<li><strong>Morgan Library</strong>: I may be a bit biased because I went there for a
exposition about J.R.R Tolkien</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some that were good but I&rsquo;m not sure if I would go again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ellis Island</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-york-city-pass">New York city pass?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my kind of travel (I didn&rsquo;t buy it) but does it worth the money? Maybe.</p>
<p>I usually choose the places I want to visit first and then I look into
the prices. People who buy the New York city pass tend (trying to
avoid generalizations, it&rsquo;s according to my sample size) to do the
opposite. They look into the city pass, read about the attractions
there and go visit them.</p>
<p>The transit museum, that is in my &ldquo;must see&rdquo; list is not part of the
city pass. The Natural History museum is pay what you want, so you may
not consider the full price (but at least $10 is worth sparing, it&rsquo;s a
great museum).</p>
<h2 id="places-to-eat">Places to eat</h2>
<p><em>(if you really care about food, skip this part because I don&rsquo;t. This
list is for those who just like me wants a list of places to not have
to care about looking for places to eat).</em></p>
<p>I went mostly to quick lunchs, so you will see fast foods most of the
time here. I usually don&rsquo;t eat at big and known places like McDonalds,
Burger King, etc. but I look for places where I can quickly eat
something and go to the next location.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shakeshack</strong>: There are many of them and the burger is good enough</li>
<li><strong>Fresh??</strong>: Good place if you want quickly eat some</li>
</ul>

                            So, I have a feed for <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHix">all my posts</a>, for the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EnglishPotHix">English posts</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech">Tech related posts</a>. Choose one and be happy! :)
