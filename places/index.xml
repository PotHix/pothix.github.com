      <description>I had the chance to spend 10 hours in Miami in a long layover in September 2023, and will describe my experience here.
Airport Nothing to complain about the airport, it worked well for me. The location is not that bad, and I could get an Uber to places I wanted to visit in the city. I got there in ~20 minutes.
VIP Lounge I was able to try the Turkish Airlines lounge and it was an OK-ish experience.</description>

      <description>I still remember the first time a friend of mine went to Strange Loop and said the conference was quite cool. When I realized it would the last edition of the conference, I decided to do my best to go to St. Louis and participate. The last edition happened in September 2023, and my description below reflects that.
Stay Union Station Hotel is a great place to stay, especially if the conference is happening there and you get a discount code for your stay ðŸ˜….</description>

      <description>Dallas was just a connection while going to St. Louis. Keep that in mind when reading the rest of what I describe here.
Airport The airport is quite big. I had to use their Air Train to get to another terminal for my connection. I was lucky to not have baggage checked-in, because I would have to re-check and go through security again before going for my connection.
My flight was delayed and the airport crew was not very concerned about people having only 30min to get their connection.</description>

      <guid>https://pothix.com/places/pisa/</guid>
      <description>In July 2023, after going to Berlin for 1 week, I decided it would be best to go to Pisa before going to Florence for the Doist retreat because flights were usually less expensive there.
A bit more than 2 days in the city and the experience was nice to relax and walk around the city.
Stay I stayed at Hotel Roma (weird, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? ðŸ¤£). The place is very well located for tourists, literally 5 minutes walking from the main square with the leaning tower.</description>

      <description>In July 2023, the Doist retreat happened in Artimino, which is part of the province of Prato. My descriptions here will be only related to that part of Prato.
Stay I stayed in the Artimino village, on the other side of the Artimino hotel, which is close to the historic house of the Medici. It&amp;rsquo;s a medieval city and contains many different rooms of this hotel (~90 rooms) and a few restaurants.</description>

      <description>In July 2023, after going to Bad Liebenzell, I still had ~1 week before the Doist retreat, so I decided to visit some friends in Berlin and get to know the city. It was a great experience.
Stay I stayed at Park Plaza Berlin Kudamm. The experience was great. I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s the best hotel I stayed paying with my own money (not paid by a company or conference).</description>

      <description>In July 2023, I used the chance of being in Europe to get to know people from a company I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some maintenance work 7 years.
They would be celebrating 70 years of their company in Bad Liebenzell. Things aligned so much that I would be &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo; with 10 days differece from my company retreat, so I did all I could to be able to go. It was hard to arrange things at home, but I was able to meet them.</description>

      <description>Frankfurt was just a connecting city for me. I was going to Bad Liebenzell and LATAM has direct flights from SÃ£o Paulo to Frankfurt.
Airport The airport is good and I was able to go through security quite quickly. Many people change planes in Frankfurt and I had the chance to be in the first seats, so I left before other people. These two facts helped me to go straight to the border control and go through the process quite fast.</description>

      <guid>https://pothix.com/places/pforzheim/</guid>
      <description>While going to Bad Liebenzell from Frankfurt, I had to forcefully stop in Pforzheim for a bit more than 2 hours. My trains were delayed and I had to wait for the last train to get to Bad Liebenzell.
Transport When I realized I had to wait a few hours for the train, I decided to try Uber or Taxis to get me there, as it would be a trip of less than 30 mins.</description>

      <description>In January 2023, my team at Doist had a meeting in Paris, so I scheduled one week before the meeting to be a tourist in Paris. What I&amp;rsquo;m writing below is a combination of the time I had as a tourist with my wife and the places we visited before/after work.
Stay In the first week I stayed with my wife on Hotel Louvre Richelieu. It&amp;rsquo;s a 3 star hotel close to the louvre.</description>

      <description>In July 2022 I spent 3 days in Rome and quite enjoyed it. The only problem was the extreme heat and crowded city, but other than that, things went great.
Stay I stayed on a BnB called CityLife Rome. I booked it on booking as I was traveling with my wife and sister and was looking for a place for 3 that was affortable and had a great location.
This place is quite close to the Roma Termini, giving you access to the lines A and B and a lot of flexibility to use the Metro.</description>

      <description>As part of a 1-week trip through Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ in 2022 (2 days) and had the chance to do a 1-day trip in 2023. I had the chance to spend 2 days in Florence with my wife and sister.
Stay I got a Hotel 3-star hotel with an amazing location, right in front of the main basilica. The hotel is called Hotel Bigallo.
The place is good enough for what we wanted.</description>

      <description>As part of a 1-week trip through Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ in 2022, I had the chance to spend 2 days in Venice with my wife and sister. It was right after the Doist retreat, and I was feeling quite tired in the first day of the trip, but the mood changed quite fast after the first day. ðŸ˜€
Stay We decided to get a Penzione with a room for 3. The name of the place is Penzione Guerrato, and it is near the Rialto bridge.</description>

      <description>The Doist retreat 2022 happened in Pertisau, so I had the chance to visit Austria for the first time ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹!
I really enjoyed the city. We got there in summer, and I heard it&amp;rsquo;s a totally different town in the winter. It&amp;rsquo;s quite cool to see how they adapt sports for the season. As an example of things I saw: they have Ski on winter, lake swimming and paragliding on summer.</description>

      <description>In June 2022 I had the chance to spend 3 days in Munich while preparing for the Doist retreat. Unfortunately, I was not feeling well in the second day of the trip, so it was mostly 2 working days, but I enjoyed it.
It was interesting to see how Germans are totally fine on doing topless or changing in public places. Not in the street, but close to the river, for example.</description>

      <description>I had the chance to visit Portland in 2015 for OSCON and 2018 for Rustconf. The city has a hipster vibe, and I like it.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing this in 2023, so it&amp;rsquo;s been 5 years since I was there for the last time and my memory will totally fail me in many aspects, so please take my recommendations and descriptions with a grain of salt.
The things I enjoyed the most was actually walking around the city.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine was driving us to nice places around Lisbon and he recommended us to go to Cascais, which is a place he likes.
Transport We went there by car with a friend, so not much to say about other ways of transport.
Places Centro histÃ³rico: Just walking around the historic center is great. If you have some time, go do it. Forte Nossa Senhora da Luz de Cascais: Small fortress, not expensive to get it.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine was driving us to nice places around Lisbon and we went to Colares just to see one single place: Cabo da Roca.
Transport We went there by car with a friend, so not much to say about other ways of transport. Not sure if it would be easy to visit using trains.
Places Cabo da roca: The view from the mountains and the see is astonishing, it was a great place to visit.</description>

      <description>I had the chance to visit Lisbon two times, both of them visiting friends and staying with them.
Stay I have friends living there and they kindly offered a spare room in their appartment for us to stay while traveling. It was amazing to have the day to explore the city and spend the night with them playing cards, having some good wine, or even having dinner somewhere.
The other time I went, there was another friend of mine hosting me for a long layover, so I would not have to sleep at the airport or look for a place for one night.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Porto for the first time in 2017 when I first joined Doist, but also had the chance to visit the city in 2019 in the company retreat.
I really like the city. Unlike Lisbon, it feels like a city that is not so big but is also not so small. To me, it feels right in the middle of a big and small city, with historical places and nice views.</description>

      <description>I went to Azores (actually, AÃ§ores in Portuguese) in the Doist company retreat of 2019. It was a hell of a ride to get there because there was a lot of complication to leave Uruguay (I was organizing Rust LATAM) and get there. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a story for a different context.
Anana We visited a place where they cultivate a specific local Anana. It looks like a pineapple, but it has its own category.</description>

      <description>In March 2019 happened the Rust LATAM 2019, which I was one of the main organizers. It happened in Montevideo, so I had some time to also walk around the city and get to know a few places.
My plan was to visit a few more places, but the Doist retreat would happen the day after the conference and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to do anything before. would recommend people to stop there, see the train station and move on.</description>

      <description>I had to chance to go to travel to NYC more than once. The first time I came there alone and the second one I went with my wife and both trips were good.
Airport I always try to go to JFK because it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest and simplest airport to use. The airport is really big and they have a train called Airtrain, that can be used to go from one terminal to another and also connects to the Subway.</description>

      <description>In 2017 I had the chance to speak at FOSDEM in Brussels, and I used this opportunity to travel around Belgium a bit, one city every day. One of the cities I visited was Antwerp.
Being very honest, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not a city I would visit again. The best part of the city for me was the train station, which is trully beautiful. I would recommend people to stop there, see the train station and move on.</description>

      <description>In 2017 I had the chance to speak at FOSDEM in Brussels, so I explored the city with some friends.
Brussels is a big city, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any problems navigating it. The experience was great, actually.
Stay It was my first time ever trying a hostel. Looking now in retrospect, the experience in Brussels was not great, but at the time I found it quite interesting.
I stayed in the hostel 2G04.</description>

      <description>After speaking at FOSDEM, I did a bigger trip through a few countries, and one of them was the Netherlands. While going from Rotterdam to Amsterday, I decided to spend a few hours (almost a day) in The Hague.
Transport I took a train there from Rotterdam and after that I got a bus. I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember how those work, but it was quite simple for me to navigate it without any experience.</description>

Stay This time I asked a few friends if I could borrow a room at their house and they accepted to host me and my wife for a few days.</description>

Everyone I spoke recommended me to visit Bruges, so I decided to go. It was not the city I liked the most, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite nice indeed.

      <description>In 2017 I had the chance to speak at FOSDEM in Brussels, and I used this opportunity to travel around Belgium a bit, one city every day. One of the cities I visited was Ghent.
Ghent is certainly the city I enjoyed visiting the most in this whole trip. The city itself is quite nice and small and there a nice castle in the middle of it.
It is worth mentioning that it was in Ghent that I saw snow for the first time in my whole life.</description>

      <description>I visited San Francisco in 2012. It was my first international trip by airplane (I literally returned from a motorcycle trip to Argentina less than a week before) ever. I went to Openstack conference, as it was something we (the company I worked for) were into at the time.
It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 10 years since I went there (writing this in 2023), so take the recommendations here with a grain of salt.</description>

Stay I stayed at Hotel Cabanas Don Juan sharing a room with some other people from the motorcycle group I was part of. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember complaining about anything while I was there.
Transport I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say as I was riding my motorcycle. It was pretty OK to drive there.</description>

      <description>Morei em Diadema por quase 30 anos. Desde os 7 anos de idade atÃ© os 34.
Por muito tempo morei no suburbio, prÃ³ximo a divisa com SÃ£o Bernardo do Campo e SÃ£o Paulo. Nessa Ã©poca eu nÃ£o tinha muito a recomendar sobre a cidade, era basicamente sobreviver e crescer.
Quando casei, me mudei para o centro de Diadema, prÃ³ximo ao Shopping PraÃ§a da MoÃ§a. Nessa Ã©poca eu comecei a conhecer melhor a cidade e aproveitar algumas coisas.</description>

      <description>Indaiatuba Ã© a minha cidade de escolha para morar a partir de 2022.
Por muitos anos eu queria me mudar para o interior de SÃ£o Paulo, mas nunca foi uma realidade. Agora com filhos e precisando de um lugar maior/melhor, decidi por Indaiatuba e espero morar muitos anos aqui.
Porque Indaiatuba? Essa seÃ§Ã£o vai ser um pouco longa porque quero contar a histÃ³ria completa.
Muita gente me pergunta porque eu escolhi Indaiatuba para morar, especialmente porque eu nÃ£o tenho famÃ­lia aqui e conheÃ§o pouquÃ­ssimas pessoas que moram por esses lados.</description>

      <description>After speaking at FOSDEM, I did a bigger trip through a few countries, and one of them was England. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Tolkien, so I decided to explore Oxford too. I wrote more about it on the page Oxford for Tolkien fans.
Stay We got an airbnb not far from the main street where the universities were. I think 15 minutes walking were enough to get there. Nothing to complain about the airbnb, the host was very polite and helpful.</description>

      <description>I have a long list of places I visited and if you look at the descriptions you will notice a pattern on how I usually travel. I decided to write this one, so I can refer to it most of the time. Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe how I like to travel when I&amp;rsquo;m alone or with my wife.
I currently have 2 kids and travelling with kids is a totally different kind of trip that I will describe in a different post.</description>
