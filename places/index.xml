      <description>I had to chance to go to travel to NYC more than once. The first time I came there alone and the second one I went with my wife and both trips were good.
Airport I always try to go to JFK because it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest and simplest airport to use. The airport is really big and they have a train called Airtrain, that can be used to go from one terminal to another and also connects to the Subway.</description>
