      <description>A lot happened since my last post and all parts are already here! ðŸ˜ƒ
It was expected that I would not have that much time to work on the keyboard when all the parts arrive, this will be a long journey. The only thing that I wanted to do as soon as possible was to check if the products were in a good condition.
These are cheap parts coming from China in a month-long journey, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to check if they are working as expected while I still can open a dispute with the seller if something is wrong.</description>

      <description>After build the Iris keyboard I decided to start a new quest to build a Dactyl-cc (as I mentioned at the end of the Iris post ðŸ˜‰)
Dactyl is the keyboad I wanted to build from the start but I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t have the skils to do it. I decided to first build a &amp;ldquo;portable kinesis&amp;rdquo;, so I could take it with me when I was traveling and Iris seemed like a great fit for this and not that hard for a first project.</description>
