                <p>I&rsquo;m Willian Molinari, also known as <strong>PotHix</strong>. I&rsquo;ve been working with
software development since 2006, using many languages professionally
throughout the years. I&rsquo;m a <a href="/writing/">published author</a> and
usually <a href="/speaking/">speak about programming</a> around Brazil and the
world.</p>
<p>I like to travel and had the chance to <a href="/places">visit 10+ countries and 7+ states of my
own country of residence</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-in-touch">Getting in touch</h3>
<p>Want to contact me? I decided to centralize the pointers to all my
profiles at <a href="https://about.me/pothix">about.me/pothix</a>.</p>
<p>You can always send me an email (preferred method) on pothix [at] pothix [dot]
com or contact me <a href="https://t.me/pothix">via Telegram</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wtf-is-pothix">WTF is PotHix</h3>
<p>Well&hellip; Here we go again. :)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this the probability that you asked me &ldquo;WTF PotHix
means&rdquo; is really high, so I redirected you to this page where I tried
to explain the reason of that silly nickname.</p>
<p>Back when <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d2/">Diablo II</a> was a
hit I had a <a href="http://diablo.gamepedia.com/Paladin_(Diablo_II)">Paladin</a>
char and was playing Diablo a lot with my friends. In the same time I
found that was really boring to create new accounts on some websites
because the name WillianMolinari was already taken on them (yes.. The
same name with the same letters), so I decided that a new nickname was
needed! And started thinking about it.</p>
<p>The requiremens are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good to read</li>
<li>Unique</li>
<li>Should represent things I like</li>
</ul>
<p>With these requirements in mind I started to pick some letters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong> aladin</li>
<li><strong>o</strong> f</li>
<li><strong>t</strong> he</li>
<li><strong>H</strong> eaven</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice! It was cool to me, I think nobody else will use PotH as a
Nickname&hellip; until I found a guy with PotH as surname when playing
Gunbound (with a 56kbs connection&hellip; LOL). So, let&rsquo;s go to the plan B:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ix</strong> - from the *.nix. Linux ftw. :)
So I got PotHix!! Yay!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Silly, isn&rsquo;t? üòê</p>
<p>As you could see on my requirements, I was not thinking on people
calling me by this name, I just wanted a good nickname to use on my
games and logins, but today I&rsquo;m known as PotHix more than Willian
Molinari. LOL</p>
<p>So, you can stop asking me if PotHix has something to do with
drugs&hellip;It is just a nerd thing from someone that haven&rsquo;t considered
people saying this out loud. ;)</p>
