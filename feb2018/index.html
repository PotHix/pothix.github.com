        <p>February time! Let&rsquo;s see what we can get from my metrics. 😀</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on <a href="https://goodreads.com/pothix">my Goodreads account</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with my reading list for this month:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read this month" title="List of books read this month"></a></p>
<p>Five books read in a month and a <strong>4.6 average rating</strong>. That&rsquo;s what I call a good reading month.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2F9ki3C">The Art of Learning: A Journey in the Pursuit of Excellence</a>. This was another fantastic recommendation by <a href="https://twitter.com/amix3k">Amir</a>. The author was a chess prodigy as a kid and an international chess master in the age of 16. He also was highly skilled in Martial arts. In this book, he shows what he extracted from his process of learning during all those years in physical and mental arts. You can read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2269391156">my review on Goodreads</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2tdJzYS">The Richest Man in Babylon</a>. This book is a series of fiction stories using Babylon as the central topic. It&rsquo;s a good book but &ldquo;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&rdquo; ruined it for me. Reason below.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2CWDdwu">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a>. It&rsquo;s a great book. When I was reading it, I asked some friends why they did not recommend it before. There are some great ideas there (depending on your political opinions, you may not like it) and I saw many of them being applied in practice in my own life. It was almost a 5 stars review, but the ending was really dull. I felt he was trying to add more pages to the book.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2taeLbk">The Art of Invisibility</a>. This is the book that makes you paranoid about security (if you care about it). I recommend you to read it if you feel secure using the internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2tgAdM1">Anything You Want</a>. An amazing book. Short, straight to the point, and with killer hints on how to Derek Sivers dealt with his business. I really recommend this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2oF2kje">Gather &lsquo;Round the Sound</a>. This was a free audiobook by Audible. It was nice to listen but nothing astonishing.</p>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from
<a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and a script that look like the one I
used last month. Here is the script with the actual data:</p>
<pre><code>var pocket = {&quot;unread&quot;:1352,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:4.14,&quot;read&quot;:1008,&quot;read_pct&quot;:6.15};

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ul&quot;);
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket[&quot;unread_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;unread&quot;] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket[&quot;read_pct&quot;] = +((1 - pocket[&quot;read&quot;] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket[&quot;read&quot;] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log(&quot;# Result: &quot; + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {&quot;unread&quot;:1420,&quot;unread_pct&quot;:4.79,&quot;read&quot;:1020,&quot;read_pct&quot;:1.18}
</code></pre><p>It means I have <strong>1420 articles unread</strong> and <strong>1020 articles
read</strong>. Comparing with my results from the last month (<strong>1352 unread</strong>
and <strong>1008 read</strong>), I got around <strong>4.8% more unread articles</strong> and <strong>1%
more read articles</strong>.</p>
<p>It seems that my unread articles list is increasing. My list of unread
increased by just 1%. I&rsquo;m still reading but not enough to take care of
the unread list.</p>
<p>I should probably consider not adding articles there anymore. I just
have to consider if the feeling of adding items &ldquo;for future
reading&rdquo; is worth keeping the system. More on that in the next months.</p>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<p>Here are the charts from <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/wakatime-editors.png" alt="Editors used during this month on Wakatime" title="Editors used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>My Vim configuration is fixed, and it&rsquo;s back to 15%. 🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/wakatime-coding.png" alt="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month" title="Hours of coding on Wakatime this month"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the screenshot is not that good, and I&rsquo;m just seeing
that some days after taking it. I will keep it here.</p>
<p>Looking at this chart is interesting. I had one week of vacation,
that you can easily see in the middle of the chart, but after that, I
had 3 days to catch up to a lot of non-coding work to do before going
full-throttle again. I&rsquo;m really interested to see if this is a pattern
in the next holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/wakatime-languages.png" alt="Languages used during this month on Wakatime" title="Languages used during this month on Wakatime"></a></p>
<p>Finally, I have two programming languages at the top instead of <code>markdown</code>. :P</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not writing on Emacs these days, and this is probably the reason I don&rsquo;t have so much markdown. <code>Python</code> is my first language but I had some <code>Ruby</code> as well. I&rsquo;m quite happy with the results. Hope to have more <code>Rust</code> or
maybe <code>Elixir</code> in the next posts.</p>
<h3 id="speaking">Speaking</h3>
<p>I had one presentation at <a href="http://www.impacta.com.br/">Impacta tecnologia</a> this month. The title was
<a href="http://www.impacta.com.br/eventos/03-02-2018-De-um-arquivo-vazio-ate-um-snake-game-funcionando-usando-Ruby-e-Gosu">Criando um snake game do zero com Ruby e
Gosu</a>. I
built a simple game from scratch, teaching the simple flows of how to
do that using Ruby. It was really nice for me, hope everyone enjoyed
as much as I did.</p>
<p>You can always check my list of talks <a href="/talks">here</a>.</p>
<p>I said that I submitted talks for two conferences last month and both
were rejected. One of them was an excellent fit for the conference, IMO. I
should probably improve my proposals and try again in the future. 🙂</p>
<h3 id="completed-tasks">Completed tasks</h3>
<p>Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). It was extracted from
<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed last month" title="Amount of tasks completed last month"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/tasks-completed.png"><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/tasks-completed.png" alt="Amount of tasks completed this month" title="Amount of tasks completed this month"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reflecting my vacation, but I can see I completed much more tasks
as soon as I got back. If we compare with the amount of coding I did,
it tells me that I had many tasks to do, but they were not related to
coding. 🤔</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that because it makes me feel better when there are not so many
commits done. 👍</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>Here is my
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;hl=en">Podcast Addict</a> stats:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcasts.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcasts.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month"></a></p>
<p><strong>2 days</strong> of podcast time is the average for me. As usual, it is the
opposite of the number of books I &ldquo;read&rdquo; (listened to).</p>
<p>As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcast_titles.jpg"><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/podcast_titles.jpg" alt="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title" title="Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title"></a></p>
<p>Just remember that this is an &ldquo;all-time list&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear as
&ldquo;most listened&rdquo; ones. I listen to <a href="http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn">CBN
podcasts</a> almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="hours-working">Hours working</h3>
<p>Here is the data from my time tracking software,
<a href="https://toggl.com">Toggl</a> comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl last month" title="Hours working using Toggl last month"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png" alt="Hours working using Toggl" title="Hours working using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an unusual pattern in this chart. Again, before and after
my vacation I had long working hours (almost 10 hours).</p>
<p>I had 16 working days this month, and I worked for 139 hours, which
mean that <strong>I worked 11 hours more than I should</strong> (it was 13 in the
last month 🎉).</p>
<p>I should probably schedule to work for 7:30 so I would work 8 hours (Brazilian way). 🙄</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check Deep work versus Shallow work:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png" alt="Deep vs Shallow work" title="Deep vs Shallow work"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost the same proportions I had <a href="/post/stats-jan-2018">in January</a>.</p>
<p>What I can take from this chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had more meetings this month; It&rsquo;s happening because I&rsquo;m a mentor to the other member of my team and there are some onboarding tasks.</li>
<li>Shallow work is still 64%. I said it was less than 50% last month, but I really don&rsquo;t know where did I get this metric. 🤔</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Read/Reply Twist&rdquo; is still consuming a lot of time. I changed my
workflow to process all <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> threads quickly
and add <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> task for them. I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s working as expected yet because these threads always take my
attention back to Twist, I have to take the control back. 🙂</p>
<p>The good thing is that it&rsquo;s entirely up to me to improve the way I deal with this problem. I will work on it. 👍</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s continue to my personal projects, last month first and this month last:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png" alt="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl" title="Hours working on personal projects using Toggl"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s improving! I had a talk last month and also some
freelance work to keep my Ruby/Rails skills up-to-date. 💪</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to see that I&rsquo;m back on track to my personal projects. It took around 6 months to stabilize as I predicted.</p>
<p>Here is my data from <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">RescueTime</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-productivetime.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-productivetime.png" alt="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime" title="Goal of productive hours on RescueTime"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-pulse.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-pulse.png" alt="RescueTime pulse" title="RescueTime pulse"></a></p>
<p>The report is finally working correctly again. The culprit for my non-productive time is Telegram. I&rsquo;m keeping it closed most of the day, but it&rsquo;s still my main communication app.</p>
<p>It looks like I&rsquo;m spending around 40-50 minutes using Telegram on average:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png" alt="Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not tracking my cell phone because I usually don&rsquo;t use it enough to
interfere with my productivity and it was just generating noise to my
data. This is why I have almost no activity during vacations.</p>
<p>I was trying to understand if I have a particular moment where I use Telegram the most:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png" alt="Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime" title="Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime"></a></p>
<p>It seems that around 10:00 is the time I most use Telegram. It&rsquo;s not
that good since it should be my peak time. I will have to improve my
morning routine. 👍</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity.jpg" alt="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity-comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/activity_comparison.jpg" alt="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app" title="Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app"></a></p>
<p>The chart shows that it&rsquo;s almost the same as the last month (<strong>6.5k</strong> steps), which is not that bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to the gym almost every day. My goal is to improve my muscles and take care of my left arm after the Bankart and Hill Sachs lesion. As I&rsquo;m not doing cardio exercises, my weight is still good:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/physical-activity-weight.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/physical-activity-weight.png" alt="Weight this month" title="Weight for this month"></a></p>
<p>Here is my sleep data for this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep for this month" title="Amount of sleep for this month"></a></p>
<p>As we can see in the chart, it&rsquo;s almost the same as the last month, and I&rsquo;m happy with that. 👍</p>
<p>Considering the whole user base from mi-band:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg" alt="Sleep comparison with the user base" title="Sleep comparison with the user base"></a></p>
<p>This chart only considers the last 7 days. My goal <a href="/post/stats-jan-2018">previous month</a> was to improve my &ldquo;Fell asleep score&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s really better now.</p>
<p>My new routine considers sleeping at 22:30 and waking up between 6 and 6:30. As you can see, it&rsquo;s working really well. 😀</p>
<p>We just have to ignore the deep sleep for the last 7 days. ✌️</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> I watched 3
episode this month:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime" title="TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime"></a></p>
<p>I forgot to add it to the app before it was too late. These 3 episodes are related to <strong>Punisher</strong>. 😀</p>
<p>I spent <strong>3 hours</strong> of my life watching TV shows this month&hellip; But I
also watched some movies. I&rsquo;m not tracking films yet because I
usually don&rsquo;t watch that much. Last year I watched less than 10
movies. In case I decide to start watching more movies I will consider
tracking them.</p>
<h3 id="words-written-and-errors">Words written and errors</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I&rsquo;m writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.</p>
<p>Here are my stats for this month:</p>

<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore my locations. Last month first and <strong>this month right after it</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-general.png" alt="General view of my locations data last month" title="General view of my locations data last month"></a> .

<p>Just visited some places more but no new cities or countries. 😞</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see the time commuting, last month first and this month second:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/jan/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance last month" title="Location time and distance last month"></a> .
<a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-time-distance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-time-distance.png" alt="Location time and distance this month" title="Location time and distance this month"></a></p>
<p>Long hours spent on vehicles this month. I decided to visit my parents, and it requires at least 12 hours on a bus 😬. My time walking is almost the same.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-moon.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/location-moon.png" alt="Kms to the moon" title="Kms to the moon"></a></p>
<h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to check my expenses! 💸</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2018/feb/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2018/feb/expenses.jpg" alt="Expenses by category this month" title="Expenses by category this month"></a></p>
<p>The chart seems to be back to normal. The &ldquo;Moradia&rdquo; (kind of a
mortgage) section increased because I was not considering it in the
previous months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not considering the money in transit from my company to my
personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant,
etc.). So, without considering it, my total savings <strong>increased by
3.20%!</strong> Now I have <strong>87.93%</strong> of my goal.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric</p>
<p><strong>It took around 4 hours</strong></p>
<p>It actually was 3:21 in my tracking software, but I spent a little bit
more than that.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s confirmed that I finally have my old routine back. It took almost
10 months to get used to the new job and feel comfortable about my
tasks to be able to focus on other things as well. This is a useful
metric per se. :)</p>
<p>I have a great trip scheduled for March, and it will probably impact my
metrics. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes! :)</p>
<p>See you next month. 🖖</p>
