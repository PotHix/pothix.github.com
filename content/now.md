This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and working for [Doist](https://doist.com)
remotely and asynchronously full-time.

[Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) when there time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

1. Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and
   [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) APIs and integrations platform at
   [Doist](https://doist.com). Mostly working with Python, Golang, and a bit of
   Typescript.
1. Improving my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) skills and [trying to
   contribute to the compiler](/post/contributing-to-rust/) (not much time for
   it nowadays, unfortunately)
1. Co-authoring a book abour Rust in pt-BR ðŸ¦€
1. Taking care of my twin babies at home with all its ups and downs (more downs
   than ups in the beggining, but there are some magic moments sometimes).
1. Building a [knowledge-base](/knowledgebase) using [Roam
   Research](https://roamresearch.com). It' literally changing the way I consume
   content. I totally recommend it.

These are some activities I still enjoy and want to be involved but I'm not finding much time nowadays:

1. Being one of the main organizers of the [SÃ£o Paulo Rust
   community](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) (for 3+ years), not
   very active due to the pandemic
1. Assembling a [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/)
1. Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available
   [here](https://pothix.com/tags/books/). I was still able to read 10 books
   last year and I'm glad about it.
1. I'm still part of the team that organizes meetups for [the Ruby community in
   SÃ£o Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (for more than 12 years)

Things that I'm avoiding because of COVID-19:

1. Organizing any kind of meetup.
1. Traveling (unfortunately)
1. Playing Magic the gathering for fun. I'm playing Pauper. [my decks are
   here](https://www.mtgvault.com/pothix/). I usually play in a local game
   store, but it's not a good time for this until I feel safe again. For now,
   I'm trying Magic arena mobile. It's not the same, but let's see.
1. Going to the Gym. Actually, going out. I'm just going for a walk with the dog
   nowadays
