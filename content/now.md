This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and working for [Doist](https://doist.com)
remotely and asynchronously full-time.

[Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) when there time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

1. Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and
   [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) APIs and integrations platform at
   [Doist](https://doist.com). Mostly working with Python, Golang, and
   Typescript.
1. Improving my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) skills and [trying to
   contribute to the compiler](/post/contributing-to-rust/) (not much time for
   it nowadays, unfortunately)
1. Co-authoring a book abour Rust in pt-BR ðŸ¦€
1. Taking care of my twin babies at home with all its ups and downs (more downs
   than ups in the beggining, but there are some magic moments sometimes).

These are some activities I still enjoy and want to be involved but I'm not finding much time nowadays:

1. Being one of the main organizers of the [SÃ£o Paulo Rust
   community](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) (for 3+ years), not
   very active due to the pandemic
1. Assembling a [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/)
1. Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available
   [here](https://goodreads.com/pothix), but moving them to this blog under the
   [books tag](https://pothix.com/tags/books/). I was still able to read 10
   books this year and I'm glad about it.
1. I'm still part of the team that organizes meetups for [the Ruby community in SÃ£o Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (for more than 12 years)

Things that I'm avoiding because of COVID-19:

1. Organizing any kind of meetup.
1. Traveling
1. Playing Magic the gathering for fun. I'm playing Pauper. [my decks are
   here](https://www.mtgvault.com/pothix/). I usually play in a local game
   store, but it's not a good time for this until I feel safe again. For now,
   I'm trying Magic arena mobile. It's not the same, but let's see.
1. Going to the Gym. Actually, going out. I'm just going for a walk with the dog
   nowadays
