This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

Spending some time with my parents at CroatÃ¡, CearÃ¡ while working for
[Doist](https://doist.com) remotely and asynchronously full-time.

[Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) when there time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

1. Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and
   [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) APIs and backend codebase at
   [Doist](https://doist.com). Mostly working with Python and Golang.
1. Improving my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) skills and [trying to
   contribute to the compiler](/post/contributing-to-rust/) (not much time for
   it nowadays, unfortunately)
1. Co-authoring [a book](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-rust)
   about Rust in pt-BR ðŸ¦€
1. Taking care of my twin children at home with all its ups and downs. The first
   was definitely hard for me but things are drastically improving and I'm
   starting to enjoy the whole parenting thing more.
1. Building a [knowledge-base](/knowledgebase) using [Roam
   Research](https://roamresearch.com). It's literally changing the way I
   consume content. I totally recommend it.

These are some activities I still enjoy and want to be involved but I'm not finding much time nowadays:

1. Being one of the main organizers of the [SÃ£o Paulo Rust
   community](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) (for 3+ years), not
   active since the beginning of the pandemic, unfortunately.
1. Trying to find some time to post abolut my fully assembled
   [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/) and to build my Corne low
   profile keyboard. I'm maintaining
   [awesome-dactyl](https://github.com/PotHix/awesome-dactyl) if you're
   interesting in knowing more about it. :)
1. Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available
   [here](https://pothix.com/tags/books/). I was still able to read 10 books
   this year already and I'm glad about it.
1. I'm still part of the team that organizes meetups for [the Ruby community in
   SÃ£o Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (since 2008!).

Now that the pandemic situation in Brazil is **much better** than it was before,
but things are starting to get concerning again, so I'm avoiding places.

I hope I can get back to meetups and IRL MTG playing this year. ðŸ¤ž
