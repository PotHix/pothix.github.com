This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm currently living in Diadema, São Paulo, Brazil. Working for
[Doist](https://doist.com) full-time and for
[Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) as a freelancer whenever
possible.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

+ Speaking whenever I have the time. My goal is to speak 19 times this year
  to surpass the 18 [Milhouse](http://milhouseonsoftware.com/) talks
  last year.
+ Co-authoring a book about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
+ Translating [my book](https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br) to English
+ Write posts to this blog
+ Learning more about [Elixir language](http://elixir-lang.org/)
+ Improving my Python skills
+ Collecting data about me to be able to [post about it monthly](/tags/stats)

I'm always trying to be more productive and write more code. [I'm posting about
my results monthly](/tags/stats), but here are my coding stats for the last
**30 days**:
