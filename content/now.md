This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm currently living in Diadema, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Working
for [Doist](https://doist.com) full-time and
for [Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) as a freelancer whenever
possible.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

+ Improving [Doist](https://developer.todoist.com) [APIs](https://developer.twistapp.com)
+ Studying the basics of motorcycle mechanics in a hands-on course in my city
+ Speaking whenever I have the time. My goal is to speak 19 times this year to
  surpass the 18 [Milhouse](http://milhouseonsoftware.com/) talks last year
+ Reviewing a book about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
+ Translating [my book](https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br) to English
+ Write posts to this blog
+ Learning more about [Elixir language](http://elixir-lang.org/) whenever possible
+ Improving my Python skills
+ Collecting data about me to be able to [post about it monthly](/tags/stats)

I'm always trying to be more productive and write more code. [I'm posting about
my results monthly](/tags/stats), but here are my coding stats for the last
**30 days**:
