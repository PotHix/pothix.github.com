This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek
Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm currently living in Indaiatuba, SÃ£o Paulo and working remotely. I have
[my own company](https://aule.software), work full-time for
[Doist](https://doist.com) and esporatically to
[Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) when I have time to spare.

Daily, I'm working on [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and sometimes
[Twist](https://developer.twist.com), improving their APIs and backend codebase
at [Doist](https://doist.com). Mostly working with Python and a bit of Golang.

While I'm not doing that, I'm taking care of my family (I have 3yo twins) at
home with all its ups and downs. It's getting better with time, but it's still
a lot of work ðŸ˜….

I've been working with a friend on a course on how to learn the Rust
programming language, hopefully it will be available in the beginning of the
next year.

There's not much more time for anything else, but something I'm trying to
prioritize is playing [Magic the gathering (Pauper)](/mtg) at least once a
month. In paper, in a local game store, to fully disconnect of everything.

There are some things I'm still involved with, but not very active:

1. Organizing the [SÃ£o Paulo Rust
   community](http//www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) ðŸ¦€ (since 2017) and
   the [Ruby community in SÃ£o Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (since 2008!). I miss
   meetups and speaking, but I can't really justify it right now.
1. Custom computer keyboards in general. I'm still trying to find some time to
   fix my fully assembled [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/) and
   post about it, and also trying to find time to build my Corne low profile
   keyboard. I have half of it working already.
