This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm living in São Paulo, Brazil and working
for [Doist](https://doist.com) full-time and
for [Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) as a freelancer
whenever possible.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

+ Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and [Twist](https://developer.twistapp.com) APIs at [Doist](https://doist.com)
+ Improving my Python skills at work
+ Playing with the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
+ In charge of the [São Paulo Rust community](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/)
+ Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available [here](https://goodreads.com/pothix)

These are some activities I still enjoy and want to be involved but I'm not finding much time nowadays:

+ Be in charge of organizing meetups for  [Guru-SP](https://gurusp.org). I'm still involved but not directly
+ Collecting data about me to be able to [post about it monthly](/tags/stats)
+ Playing Magic the gathering for fun. I'm playing Pauper. [my decks are here](https://www.mtgvault.com/pothix/)


I'm always trying to be more productive and write more code. [I was
posting my stats monthly in the past](/tags/stats), but I'm not having
enough time for it at the moment. Instead, here are my coding stats
for the last **30 days**:
