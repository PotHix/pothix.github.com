This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm living in São Paulo, Brazil and working
for [Doist](https://doist.com) full-time and
for [Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) as a freelancer
when I have time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

1. Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) integrations platform at [Doist](https://doist.com)
1. Working full time (and improving my skills) with Python and Golang
1. Improving my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) skills and [trying to contribute to the compiler](/post/contributing-to-rust/) (not much time for it nowadays, unfortunately)
1. Being one of the main organizers of the [São Paulo Rust community](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) (for 2+ years), not very active due to the pandemic
1. Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available [here](https://goodreads.com/pothix)
1. Researching and buying stuff to assemble my [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/)
1. Taking care of my twin babies at home and not sleeping much.

These are some activities I still enjoy and want to be involved but I'm not finding much time nowadays:

1. I'm still part of the team that organizes meetups for [the Ruby community in São Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (for more than 11 years)
1. Playing with Cardistry and Magic. It's a nice hobby and helps to be outside of the digital world sometimes.

Things that I'm avoiding because of COVID-19:

1. Playing Magic the gathering for fun. I'm playing Pauper. [my decks are here](https://www.mtgvault.com/pothix/). I usually play in a local game store, but it's now closed to avoid social interaction.
1. Going to the Gym. Actually, going out. I'm avoinding anything that's not staying home.

Here are my coding stats for the last **30 days**:
