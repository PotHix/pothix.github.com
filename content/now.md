This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm currently living for one month in York, England. Working
for [Doist](https://doist.com) full-time and
for [Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) as a freelancer
whenever possible.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

+ Improving [Doist](https://developer.todoist.com) [APIs](https://developer.twistapp.com)
+ Speaking whenever I have the time. Already met my goals of [19 and 25
  talks](/talks), not sure if I will speak again this year.
+ Trying to translate [my book](https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br) to English (in my spare time, rare nowadays)
+ Improving my Python skills
+ Collecting data about me to be able to [post about it monthly](/tags/stats)

I'm always trying to be more productive and write more code. [I'm posting about
my results monthly](/tags/stats), but here are my coding stats for the last
**30 days**:
