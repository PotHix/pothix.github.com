This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm currently living in Indaiatuba, SÃ£o Paulo while working remotely. I have
[my own company](https://aule.software), work full-time for
[Doist](https://doist.com) and [Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com)
when there time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

1. Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and
   [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) APIs and backend codebase at
   [Doist](https://doist.com). Mostly working with Python and a bit of Golang.
1. Taking care of my twins at home with all its ups and downs.
1. Building a [second brain](/knowledgebase) using [Roam
   Research](https://roamresearch.com). 
1. I'm idle on my roles of organizing the [SÃ£o Paulo Rust
   community](http//www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) ðŸ¦€ (since 2017) and
   the [Ruby community in SÃ£o Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (since 2008!). I miss
   meetups and speaking, but I can't really justify it right now.
1. Trying to find some time to post about my fully assembled
   [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/) and to build my Corne low
   profile keyboard. I'm maintaining
   [awesome-dactyl](https://github.com/PotHix/awesome-dactyl) if you're
   interesting in knowing more about it. :)
