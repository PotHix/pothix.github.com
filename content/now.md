This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and working for [Doist](https://doist.com)
remotely and asynchronously full-time.

[Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) when there time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

1. Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and
   [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) APIs and backend codebase at
   [Doist](https://doist.com). Mostly working with Python and Golang.
1. Improving my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) skills and [trying to
   contribute to the compiler](/post/contributing-to-rust/) (not much time for
   it nowadays, unfortunately)
1. Co-authoring a book about Rust in pt-BR ðŸ¦€
1. Taking care of my twin children at home with all its ups and downs. Things
   are totally improving now compared to what they used to be months ago.
1. Building a [knowledge-base](/knowledgebase) using [Roam
   Research](https://roamresearch.com). It' literally changing the way I consume
   content. I totally recommend it.

These are some activities I still enjoy and want to be involved but I'm not finding much time nowadays:

1. Being one of the main organizers of the [SÃ£o Paulo Rust
   community](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) (for 3+ years), not
   active since the beginning of the pandemic, unfortunately.
1. Trying to get some time to assemble a
   [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/) and a Corne low profile
   keyboard. I'm maintaining
   [awesome-dactyl](https://github.com/PotHix/awesome-dactyl) if you're
   interesting in knowing more about it. :)
1. Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available
   [here](https://pothix.com/tags/books/). I was still able to read 10 books
   this year already and I'm glad about it.
1. I'm still part of the team that organizes meetups for [the Ruby community in
   SÃ£o Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (since 2008!).

Now that the pandemic situation in Brazil is **much better**, I'm starting to go
out a bit and meet friends in open spaces.

I hope I can get back to meetups and IRL MTG playing next year. ðŸ¤ž
