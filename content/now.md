This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm living in São Paulo, Brazil and working
for [Doist](https://doist.com) full-time and
for [Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com) as a freelancer
when I have time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

+ Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) integrations platform at [Doist](https://doist.com)
+ Working full time (and improving my skills) with Python and Golang
+ Improving my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) skills and [trying to contribute to the compiler](/post/contributing-to-rust/) (not much time for it nowadays, unfortunately)
+ Being one of the main organizers of the [São Paulo Rust community](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) (for almost 2+ years)
+ Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available [here](https://goodreads.com/pothix)
+ Following up closely to the evolution of my twin babies that are currently in the ICU for being prematures

These are some activities I still enjoy and want to be involved but I'm not finding much time nowadays:

+ I'm still part of the team that organizes meetups for [the Ruby community in São Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (for more than 11 years)
+ Playing with Cardistry and Magic. It's a nice hobby and helps to be outside of the digital world sometimes.

Things that I'm avoiding because of COVID-19:

+ Playing Magic the gathering for fun. I'm playing Pauper. [my decks are here](https://www.mtgvault.com/pothix/). I usually play in a local game store, but it's now closed to avoid social interaction.
+ Not going to the Gym daily

Here are my coding stats for the last **30 days**:
