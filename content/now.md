This is my [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired
by [Derek Sievers](https://sivers.org/now).

I'm currently living in Indaiatuba, SÃ£o Paulo while working remotely. I have
[my own company](https://aule.software), work full-time for
[Doist](https://doist.com) and [Intervac](https://intervac-homeexchange.com)
when there time to spare.

Here is a list of my current priorities:

1. Improving [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com) and
   [Twist](https://developer.twist.com) APIs and backend codebase at
   [Doist](https://doist.com). Mostly working with Python and a bit of Golang.
1. Improving my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) skills. I would love
   to [contribute to the compiler](/post/contributing-to-rust/), but I can't
   find enough time for it nowadays, unfortunately.
1. Taking care of my twins at home with all its ups and downs. They are
   currently on their terrible twos, but starting preschool now, which makes me
   feel the silence again for a few hours.
1. Building a [second brain](/knowledgebase) using [Roam
   Research](https://roamresearch.com). 
1. Organizing the [SÃ£o Paulo Rust
   community](http//www.meetup.com/Rust-Sao-Paulo-Meetup/) ðŸ¦€ (I'm doing that
   since 2017) and the [Ruby community in SÃ£o Paulo](https://gurusp.org) (since
   2008!), while speaking about the topics I love here and there.
1. Trying to find some time to post about my fully assembled
   [dactyl-cc](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc/) and to build my Corne low
   profile keyboard. I'm maintaining
   [awesome-dactyl](https://github.com/PotHix/awesome-dactyl) if you're
   interesting in knowing more about it. :)
1. Consuming books (mostly audiobooks on Audible). My reviews are available
   [here](https://pothix.com/tags/books/).
