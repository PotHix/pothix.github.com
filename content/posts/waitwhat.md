Book: [Wait, What?: And Life's Other Essential Questions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31307683) by James E. Ryan. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I bought this book as an Audible daily deal. For the price and size of the book, it was ok.

The book is exactly what the author says in the beginning: It's a lecture that became a book. It can be summarized in less than 10 lines. Please read the other reviews and you will know the whole book.

These are my notes while reading:

* Questions are just as important as answers. An answer is just as good as a question is.
* The only bad questions are not questions at all; they are more like insults being used as questions
* "Wait, what?" is a question for clarification.
* Asking "Wait, What?" helps you to pause and think before reaching a conclusion
* Understand first and make judgment last
* If you ask "I wonder why..." About the present, you may want to ask "I wonder if.. " about the future
* "Couldn't we at least..." Can be used to get out of a stuck state
* "How can I help?" can save lives. It can help you to understand what the real problem is.
* "What truly matters?" should be used to gain focus on any situation
