Book: [J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3401638686). Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It's not a secret to anyone that [I'm a big fan of J.R.R.
Tolkien](/oxford-tolkien). I have 3 versions of this book. A translated version
(pt-BR), the original version in English, and the audiobook. It's no news that
it would be a 5 star book to me.

I just listened to the Inklings book by Humphrey Carpenter, so it was the best
time to also listen to this one (yes, I went for the Audiobook).

Tolkien was a genius and a real nerd IMO. Reading this biography is also
finding the human part of Tolkien. He had his own flaws and lived a simple life
as a professor in Oxford. When he started making real money from his creations,
he was already 60+ years old.

It was great to see that The Silmarillion was Tolkien's life work. Everything
else he did was creating more content on top of the Silmarillion.

The attention to details Tolkien had is out of this world. Thinking about where
the moon should be in the story to make things coherent is something that very
few authors take into account. It took more than a decade to write the LotR.

Well, if you like the man and/or his work, I definitely recommend you
read/listen to this one. Humphrey Carpenter did a great job capturing who
Tolkien was and what he did.

Here are my rough notes for this book:

* Tolkien had a situation with a poisonous spider when he was a kid. He often
  said it did not cause any dislikes on him about spiders but often used them
  in his books
* The only memory of his father was him painting "AR Tolkien" (Arthur Reuel) on
  the lead of a trunk
* Tolkien's mother knew Latin, French, and German
* Tolkien liked to draw trees and be with trees. He didn't care about botanical
  details, he liked the shape of trees. He even talked to trees when he was a
  kid.
* Tolkien's mother corrected grammatical errors in his stories when he was a
  kid. Example: "a great green dragon" instead of "a green great dragon"
* Many times Ms. Tolkien removed her children from school because she could
  educate them better
* Tolkien disliked Shakespeare
* Tolkien was 13 when his mother died
* Anglo saxon == old english
* Both Tolkien and Edith were orphans
* Tolkien did not know about homosexuality until he was 19. At the age of boys
  are discovering romance he was forced to be distant from Edith and be around
  people of the same sex. He associated male company with most of its good in
  life
* The painting of "the mountain spirit" is the origin of Gandalf
* Tolkien did not come from a rich family and the distinction was clear among
  groups at the University. He found some catholic friends there, which made
  things easier -- It's interesting how religion plays a social role in many
  contexts
* Tolkien was fascinated by the Welsh language
* Tolkien had a different style of handwriting for each of his friends
* Tolkien and Edith spent 3 years apart from each other and they grew
  differently. Both had to do concessions if they want to stay together.
  Tolkien had to tolerate  Edith's absorption in the daily things of life, as
  trivial as it looks for him. Edith had to tolerate Ronald's invented
  languages and academic papers, as selfish as it looks for her
* Tolkien considered himself as a sentimental one but that's not what he shows
  to his male friends
* If Tolkien had shown Edith his "bookish face" she would be more tolerant when
  those topics appear in their marriage, but he kept the two sides of his life
  firmly apart
* Tolkien didn't see him as an inventor of stories but a discover of legends
* "You can't have a language without people to speak it". Tolkien was creating
  the story to support his made-up languages
* His language would come from the land that Earendel saw in his strange voyage
* Sam Gangi is a reflection of the English soldier taking care of their
  superior
* Unfinished tales should be "The book of lost tales" if it was completed
* "I never knew a man of this age that is, in this respect, his equal" -- his
  boss from the oxford English dictionary
* Tolkien and Gordon formed a "Viking Club" which consisted of them drinking
  large quantities of beer and reciting Norse sagas
* Tolkien did not finish the Silmarillion and he would probably never finish
  it. Sometimes because of his perfectionism and others because he doesn't want
  his mythology to die when finished
* Tolkien lived in Leeds for years and was a professor at Leeds university
* At the age of 32, Tolkien was a professor at Leeds, had many languages
  developed (Sindarin, Quenya, etc.), have written most of Silmarillion, and
  had three children
* Tolkien was a professor of Anglo-Saxon for 20 years, then elected Merton
  professor of English and literature, lived the first part of his retirement
  in Oxford, moved, came back to Oxford after Edith died, and had a peaceful
  death at the age of 81. It was the ordinary remarkable life lived by
  scholars. A life of academic brilliance for sure, but only in a very narrow
  academic field.
* Between these years where "nothing happens" Tolkien wrote two books that
  because best sellers and kept the imagination and thinking of several million
  readers
* "It's a strange paradox the fact that The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings
  are the work of an obscure Oxford professor who specialized in Anglo-Saxon
  and Middle English who lived an ordinary suburban life bringing up his
  children and tending his garden."
* Edith and Ronald had their own rooms and did not disturb one another. Edith
  finds Ronald's snoring tiresome.
* Ronald was not a big fan of railways because it brings noise and dirty to the
  countryside
* Tolkien was not a big fan of news (as well as his friend Lewis) because
  journalists are usually not masters of the topics they write about it things
  and opinions change very fast
* Tolkien did not give much care to his clothes. Everything he used was common
  and not much thought
* Tolkien was an old fashion conservative. He liked monarchy and did not
  believe in the rule if the people
* Tolkien's perfectionism didn't help him to publish articles, he edits too
  much.
* Edith noticed that one part of Tolkien only came alive when being with other
  men of his kind
* At some point, Edith opposed to Tolkien taking kids to the mass and she
  showed some anti-catholic behaviors.
* Tolkien usually worked until late times because it was only when Edith went
  to bed that he had time without interruptions at his desk. It was mostly
  domestic matters or Edith requiring attention, which was quite normal. It was
  often irritant to him but he took it patiently
* Tolkien was never shy of kissing his sons in public, even when they grew up
* Tolkien realized he could use all the complexity and creativity he used for
  Silmarillion to also create simple stories for his children
* Tom Bombadil was based on a Dutch doll that belongs to Michael
* "In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit" was the first sentence of the
  hobbits ever written
* Gandalf was called Bladolfin and Gandalf was the leader of the dwarfs. The
  name Gandalf was taken from the Icelandic and means sorcerer elf
* The hobbit was abandoned right after the death of Smaug. It was only
  resurrected after a graduating student asked for the manuscript, read it, and
  told the publishers about it.
* The Shire was everything Tolkien liked about England.
* The first name of Frodo was Bingo
* The lord of the rings is the realization of the Silmarillion, which only
  became viable because of the Hobbit
* "Germans virtues (and they are virtues!) in obedience and patriotism are
  greater than ours". He curses Adolf Hitler for perverting these virtues.
* Tolkien was very perfectionist. Christopher helped by drawing a map, but he
  had to calculate distances, make names consistent, calculating moon phases,
  and even the direction of the wind sometimes
* Tolkien was 51 and scared that he would never finish his stories because of
  the huge amount of work it requires to make everything consistent. He was
  already known for his procrastination on his philological work
* Leaf by niggle was written while Tolkien was concerned about the progress of
  his mythological world, in the middle of the writing of LotR
* Tolkien didn't have the same way of thinking as Charles Williams but they
  were friends.
* It's hard to say why the friendship with CS Lewis started to cool down. Maybe
  because Tolkien disliked the Narnia stories by Lewis or the fact that the
  whole Narnia chronicles were written 3x faster than then LotR, or maybe
  because Tolkien was seeing a fan of his mythology become a successful writer
  by himself. There was also the fact that Lewis went to Cambridge after some
  time, which made it harder to keep in touch.
* It took 12  years to write LotR
* Silmarillion was Tolkien's life work. Rejecting it was almost an insult to
  him
* Tolkien just had one manuscript of LotR -- seeing that today feels very
  frightening
* The publisher had an agreement with Tolkien to do split sharing. After the
  book paid its costs, the author and the publisher will share the profits.
  This model was usually used for non-conventional books as it reduces risks
  for the publisher and better rewards the author in case the book sells.
* It took more than 16 years since the beginning of the writing of LotR until
  its publication
* They initially printed 3500 copies of the fellowship of the ring
* Tolkien hated combustion engines and the problems they bring to society
* The first check Tolkien received from the publisher was considerably more
  than his annual salary at the University
* Tolkien replying to letters from fans played an important part in fixing the
  pirating problem he had in America
* Tolkien was too kind to reject interviews but he decided to select just a few
  of them to accept because there were too many. He usually likes people when
  he meets them but got annoyed soon after. He usually starts an alarm clock
  when a visitor comes in and tell the visitor he has other things to do when
* Edith became friends with Joy (wife of CSL) and Tolkien and Lewis had part of
  their friendship back
* Tolkien used to reply to almost all letters, especially the ones coming from
  children or elderly people. Sometimes he wrote the same letter more than once
  until he was satisfied with the final version. It took much of his time.
* After the death of CS Lewis, Tolkien wrote: "So far I have felt the normal
  feelings of a man of my age - like an old tree that is losing all its leave
  one by one: this feels like an axe-blow near the roots".

Thoughts when reading the book (the ones I take note while reading):

* It's interesting that most of the work Tolkien was famous for writing was not
  his main job. Many parts of his main job were contributors to give him
  knowledge for it, but the work itself is totally related to his passion for
  literature, languages, and old tales
