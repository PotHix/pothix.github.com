March is gone, and it's time for metrics! üìä

### Books

**Note**: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on [my Goodreads account](https://goodreads.com/pothix).

Just one book this month, but a 5 stars one:

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

[When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect
Timing](https://amzn.to/2v3yIBB). This book is about optimization
based on time and energy. What is the best time to do some action
based on statistics? I found it to be amazing and could confirm
many of the assumptions with my data. I would recommend everyone
who likes to improve their performance to read this book and draw
their conclusions.

### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file from
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and a script that look like the one I
used last month. Here is the script with the actual data:

```
var pocket = {"unread":1420,"unread_pct":4.79,"read":1020,"read_pct":1.18}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket["unread_pct"] = +((1 - pocket["unread"] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket["unread"] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket["read_pct"] = +((1 - pocket["read"] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket["read"] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log("# Result: " + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {"unread":1446,"unread_pct":1.8,"read":1050,"read_pct":2.86}
```

It means I have **1446 articles unread** and **1050 articles
read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (**1420 unread**
and **1020 read**), I got around **1.8% more unread articles** and **2.8%
more read articles**.

The percentages are better this month, and this is a good thing. I'm
happy to see that I read 30 articles this month. üôÇ

### Coding

Here are the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2018/mar/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Vim and Emacs usage following the same patterns.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

This month was a very particular one since I had the [Doist
retreat](https://twitter.com/amix3k/status/977808357376626689) (an
AMAZING experience which deserves a post) and one week vacation. Not
so much coding done.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2018/mar/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

`Python` is my first language but I had some `Ruby` as
well. Unfortunately, there's no mention of `Rust` or `Elixir` this
month. üòû

### Speaking

No speaking this month but I helped organize a workshop about agile
methodologies and how it could help our work at Doist. It was an
excellent experience.

### Completed tasks

Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
[Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed last month](/images/stats/2018/feb/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed last month")](/images/stats/2018/feb/tasks-completed.png)
[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2018/mar/tasks-completed.png)

Almost 190 tasks in the week I returned to work. üòÖ

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2018/mar/podcasts.jpg)

**3 days** of podcast time is above average for me. As usual, here is
the list of Podcasts and their times:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2018/mar/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title")](/images/stats/2018/mar/podcast_titles.jpg)

Remember that this is an "all-time list", and I'm tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear as
"most listened" ones. I listen to [CBN
podcasts](http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn) almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here is the data from my time tracking software,
[Toggl](https://toggl.com) comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):

[![Hours working using Toggl last month](/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl last month")](/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-working.png "")

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working.png "")

It seems quite stable this month.

I had 12 tracked working days this month, and I worked for 107 hours,
which mean that **I worked 11 hours more than I should** (it was also 11 in
the last month with more days tracked üòû).

Let's check Deep work versus Shallow work:

[![Deep vs Shallow work](/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "Deep vs Shallow work")](/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "")

What I can take from this chart:

* I had more meetings than usual, but it's not too bad
* Shallow work is still 55% (better than 64% from February)
* The Shallow work task (the most generic I have) is still the big
  black box. I'm trying not to split the tracking too much, or it will
  be too much work to manage it. Maybe it will be useful to
  separate lunchtime and other typical things just to check the time
  slacking.

"Read/Reply Twist" is still consuming a lot of time, almost 2 hours
every day. I'm still fighting to implement my process of checking it
in the morning, add tasks and just review in the afternoon. I should
probably avoid doing it in the morning, but it's still hard for me.

Now, let's continue to my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2018/feb/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2018/mar/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

That's not much to compare here, but at least it seems stable. üëç

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")
[![RescueTime pulse](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-pulse.png "RescueTime pulse")](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-pulse.png "")

It's worst than last month üòû. I had a pulse of 62, and it's now 54. I
can't say why it's bad, at least I could not feel anything wrong
during the last month. Maybe it was related to the travel planning.

Still following my Telegram usage, here is the comparison from the
previous month to the current one:

[![Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png "Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time.png "")
[![Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png "Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time.png "")

It seems quite stable, let's wait for the next month.

I'm still trying to understand if I have a particular moment where I
use Telegram the most, here is the difference from the last month to
the current one:

[![Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/feb/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "")
[![Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/mar/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "")

Nothing outstanding but 10:00 is still the time I most use Telegram. It's not
that good since it should be my peak time. I will have to improve my
morning routine. üëç

I've added a warning when I use Telegram for more than 30 minutes in
the day. That is helping me to understand my usage pattern.

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2018/mar/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2018/mar/activity.jpg "")
[![Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2018/mar/activity_comparison.jpg "Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2018/mar/activity-comparison.jpg "")

This month was better than the last one. **10.5k steps** compared to
6.5k from previous month. üëç This is expected since I had two weeks to
move around because of the retreat and my vacation in Santiago.

As I got back in April, it did not reflect on my weight, but the
result will be horrible for the next month üòÖ:

[![Weight this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/physical-activity-weight.png "Weight for this month")](/images/stats/2018/mar/physical-activity-weight.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2018/mar/sleep.jpg "")

I was expecting a decrease this month. During the retreat I did not
sleep that much because I was trying to enjoy every second of that
experience.

This month is an outlier of my routine, but I think it will be back
for the next.


### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 3
episode this month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2018/mar/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2018/mar/tvshows.jpg "")

But these are the same 3 episodes of the last month, so I did not
watch any tv show this month. ‚úå


### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I'm writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **50348** words written (**72766** last month)
+ **825** corrections made (**3451** last month)
+ **10944** unique words (**14352** last month)

Nothing to extract from these metrics since it's different from the
last month because of the retreat + vacations.

### Locations

Thanks to Doist I visited Chile this month! üôÉ

[![Countries I visited](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-countries.png "Countries I visited")](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-countries.png "")

For some reason, Argentina is on the list as well. I've been there
already but not this time. :P

I had one week of vacations and decided to walk around Santiago and
relax. Because of that, I've added many places to the list:

[![Places I visited](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-places.png "Places I visited")](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-places.png "")

Let's compare the difference between last month and this month. Last
month first and **this month right after it**:

[![General view of my locations data last month](/images/stats/2018/feb/location-general.png "General view of my locations data last month")](/images/stats/2018/feb/location-general.png "") .
[![General view of my locations data this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png "General view of my locations data this month")](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-general.png "")

One new country, 12 cities, and almost 50 more places. Quite nice. üòÄ

It's expected to have more commuting, and walking this month:

[![Location time and distance last month](/images/stats/2018/feb/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance last month")](/images/stats/2018/feb/location-time-distance.png "") .
[![Location time and distance this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance this month")](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-time-distance.png "")

Still many kilometers to "reach the moon":

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2018/mar/location-moon.png "")

### Expenses

It's time to check my expenses! üí∏

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2018/mar/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2018/mar/expenses.jpg "")

This month I will have to count a big investment in traveling (yes,
traveling for me is an investment in many aspects). It's like that
because I'm still paying some of the previous flights and I exchanged
all the money before going to Chile, so I went with cash for the whole
trip.

It seems like I spent around 60% of my income this month, which is not
regular at all. I usually spend about 40% (or less). The monthly
expenses with my home ("Moradia") are finally part of the chart now,
and I also added family health care on "Outros gastos".

This month is an outlier, but the result is not that bad, IMO. üëç

As usual, I'm not considering the money in transit from my company to
my personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant
payment, etc.). So, without considering it, my total savings
**increased by 3%** and now I have **90.56%** of my goal.

### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric

**It took 3 hours and 30 minutes**

That counts the whole process of organizing my data (I usually review
my investment portfolio as well), taking screenshots, and writing this
post.


### Conclusion

This was not a normal month at all, but it was really amazing. You
can't see it in my metrics (maybe the locations ü§î) but keep in mind
that not all parts of your life will be on your metrics and that's
OK. I put a lot of effort to create this blog post but I also know
when I should enjoy life and let things go.

See you next month. üññ
