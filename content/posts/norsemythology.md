Book: [Norse Mythology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37903770) by Neil Gaiman. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This book was in my reading list for a while. After an exam that requires pupil dilatation, I decided to go for the audiobook as it would not require any notes. :)

It's interesting to see the influence of Norse Mythology in some things. I particularly noted that Ragnarok mentions the coldest winter, which is also mentioned in ASOIAF as something the is near to the end of the world.

It was also nice to compare Marvel's Thor with the real Thor. They are totally different characters. After listening to this book, I now imagine Thor as a god version of Tormund (Game of Thrones), instead of the version we see in Avengers.

Something unexpected is how much Loki participated in the whole story. He was part of all stories and also a crucial part of Ragnarok. If there's a central character, I would say it's Loki.

The Norse Mythology also had their own Adan and Eve. This whole thing makes me wonder about the creation of religion and how everything relates to how their people see the world. The fact that the connection between Midgard (earth) and Asgard ("heaven") is a "rainbow" in a religion where people live in places where Auroras are common is an interesting correlation. :)

The whole book is hilarious. I felt like someone listening to stories near to a bonfire. Many of these stories look very childish, which is very interesting.

I would totally recommend reading this one. :)
