Book: [1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427) by George Orwell. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I was between a 4 and 5 stars for this book and decided to go with 4.

The ideas behind this book are amazing, especially when you read a little bit about Orwell and the political scenario of the time. It is a criticism of many things but it's still an interesting construct of what may happen in a very extreme scenario.

The whole idea of creating a language to limit how people describe things and how they think is a really interesting concept.

As a novel, it's not that good. You don't care much about the characters and just one or two are really strong, and this is why I decided to not review with 5 stars. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.

Bonus: If you ever listened to "Testify" by Rage Against the Machine, you will recognize part of the song in the book. ;)
