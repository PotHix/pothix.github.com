Book: [Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/773858) by Steve Martin. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I got a recommendation for this book on Quora. I don't even remember what was the question about, but I usually mark some books to read when I get these "books you should read" questions.

I had low expectations about this one and it surprised me. :)

It was great to follow Steve's career from the broke comedian to a famous one. The struggles to start, the glorious days, and the decline.

There were not many notes this time, but here are the ones I have:

If the light is thrown on the spectators, they don't laugh
Once she told the ventriloquist to get his dummy closer to the microphone
I was sad one day and mentioned that my high School girlfriend broke up with me. He said: "Oh, that will happen a lot"
When doing standup, the jokes are now about you. It's not a guy that entered in a bar, it was you.
Most jokes have a punchline and cues. Sometimes there are cues as gestures
Do you mind if I smoke? No! Do you mind if I fart? -- LOL
How many people never raised the hand before?
There was I time I couldn't convince the audience that the show was over. They were thinking it was all part of the show -- LOL
"I'm a celebrity now. Normal rules of social interaction no longer apply"
