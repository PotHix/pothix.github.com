Book: [Daily Rituals: How Artists Work](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1831746176). Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I just read the book [When](/when) and it mentioned this book. The idea was so
interesting that I decided to give it a try.

What first caught my attention was the pattern of the peak, through, rebound
everywhere. It's not everywhere because we're just mentioning artists here. I
believe a similar pattern tends to emerge whenever people have control over
their time.

There's certainly outliers to this, but artists listed on this book usually had
some hours of uninterrupted work to do their craft. Some interesting highlights
of what happened to the vast majority of them:

* Their peak happened early in the morning (with some exceptions, of course)
* They had walking as part of their daily routine
* They blocked a big portion of uninterrupted time to work
* They were very passionate about what they did
* They had a strict routine

This is my perception about the stories but, as expected, there are examples of
people that deviate from this.

There are not many notes for this book because it is very shallow. Instead of
writing notes, I prefer to refer to the book directly if I needed. Here are the
few ones I wrote:

+ After writing something take some time to stop and copy it. When copying, you
  will be thinking about it
+ Mozart composed in the morning and then gave lessons. He also composed at
  night. He worked too much though and wrote until 1 just to wake up at 6
+ 3 hours a day would produce what a man is out to write. The guy wrote every
  day before getting dressed for breakfast
+ John Adams: "I try to take a random freedom in my daily life so I will be
  ready when ideas come"
+ Jean-Paul Sartre usually deep worked 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the
  afternoon. It was his only rule.
