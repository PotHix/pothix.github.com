Book: [Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146) by David Kushner. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I love this book. The two Johns created an empire by using the engineering capabilities of Carmack with the enthusiasm and ideas of Romero.

There are some other thoughts to put on this book. The two Johns are doing great and creating amazing games following the startup way of life, relying on junk food and diet coke. Everything was balanced, they had a committed engineer that are addicted to create new things and pursue really hard challenges. But they also had a good game designer that are eager to test the new advances in technology and create the most awesome game in the world.

When the two Johns decided to split, the two sides suffered. And the same situation happens a lot in companies these days. Sometimes we have an awesome engineer that can't spread the awesome tools he is creating. The same situation occurs when we have an average programmer that bring people together and encourage everyone to create and use the tools that are being created, but are not so awesome.

By creating a team with these complimentary profiles it is possible to generate awesome things as DOOM was at the time it was created.
