Book: [How to Spot a Liar with People Don't Tell the Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29755158) by Gregory Hartley. Rating: ⭐️⭐️.

I've used the Audible Abridged version for this one. The narration is not good as the other audiobooks I'm used to listen.

The book content is not good to follow as well. It is focused on interrogation and this is not my goal for reading it.

But it is not all that bad. I got some interesting tips on body language and these kind of stuff.
