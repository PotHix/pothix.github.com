Book: [O Cavaleiro dos Sete Reinos (The Tales of Dunk and Egg #1-3)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19220663) by George R.R. Martin. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It's a good story for those who follow the whole series of "A song of ice and fire" as it occurs around 100 years before the first book.

The only part that is a bit annoying is that the story feels unfinished for me in the end, but the whole experience is good enough.
