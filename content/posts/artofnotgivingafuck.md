Book: [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707) by Mark Manson. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It was good at the beginning but the end was too self-help for me.

I learned good things in this book and that's what matters for me.
Here goes a list:

* Give a fuck about things you already have, not only what you want.
* We have a limited number of fucks to give, choose yours wisely.
* If you're giving a fuck to a lot of things is because you're lacking important things to give a fuck
* Everyone wants the good parts of life (playing in a band and being a rockstar) but nobody wants the difficult part (countless hours playing your guitar alone and working on band's marketing). Fail is the way forward.
* Your actions are guided by your values, think about it and define good values for your life.
* Set good metrics for yourself. The example of Dave Mustaine is really great. Mustaine is awesome but he always compares his band with Metallica. He may have better metrics than that.
* Take responsibility for your feelings. You can't control other people's feelings, but you can control your own.
* Traveling is a good way to grow. You will understand how people live with different values and are happy with that.

This book in the list of the best books I read this year, but it's not a bad book. Depending on the state of your life nowadays, you may get good information from it.
