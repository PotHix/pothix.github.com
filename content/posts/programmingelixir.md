Book: [Programming Elixir: Functional |> Concurrent |> Pragmatic |> Fun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17971957) by Dave Thomas. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It's not the best Elixir book I read but it's a good book.

I started with Programming Phoenix for a more practical learning. This book feels like the other "Programming language book". You will find how to split a string, or how you can deal with regex. In case you're looking for the methods for many types, it will be for you.

For me, it's not the best book to start, but it's a good one to improve your skills and "programming language vocabulary".
