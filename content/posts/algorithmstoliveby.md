Book: [Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25666050) by Brian Christian. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This is that kind of book that does not answer questions, it just creates a lot more. :)

I tend to not implement algorithms just for the sake of learning a new one and this is not a good thing. When you read these kinds of books you understand why it's so important to know which kinds of algorithms already exists and which problems they solve.

Real hackers (Read [b:Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution|56829|Hackers Heroes of the Computer Revolution|Steven Levy|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435697935s/56829.jpg|1407224]) implement their own code just for the sake of learning something new or for the joy of programming. When you really need to deal with a complex problem, the tools will be already in your mind, just compose and create.

This book helps understanding some interesting algorithms that we use (or should be using) in real life. You will understand the basics about them.

In case you're a programmer, it will probably generate a list of new topics to study. :)
