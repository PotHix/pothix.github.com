Book: [Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40876575) by Rutger Bregman. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

A good book that I will recommend to many people. I was between 4 and 5 stars for this one and decided to go with 4. If there was a 4.5, I would totally go for it.

I don't agree with all the ideas presented here but I enjoyed thinking about them and seeing some different perspectives on it.
There's one sentence in this book that I'm saying to some friends for a while: "If you don't like the way the world is going, realize that there are many people out there thinking just like you. Turn down the TV, look around, and organize". The current state of many people is to read the news and TV and complain on social media. For some unknown reason, this is how they think they are going to do some change.
