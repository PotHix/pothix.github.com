re-reading 2017
I will work on a new project and this book will be a perfect fit for the new work environment, so I decided to revisit it.

I wrote my book ([b:Desconstruindo a Web: As tecnologias por trás de uma requisição|31686001|Desconstruindo a Web As tecnologias por trás de uma requisição|Willian Molinari|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1472242612s/31686001.jpg|52359321]) using Deep work and it was an amazing experience.

Embrace boredom is the most difficult practice from this book. I use my phone a lot but most of the time I'm listening to audiobooks or podcasts. Instant messengers are still part of my daily life, I have to schedule some time to use them. A good quote for that: "Don't take breaks from shallow work, take breaks from focus!"

review 2016
This book is awesome! It summarizes what I think about concentration and the "new" concept of open offices that we have today.

I have a big problem to concentrate when there is too much noise or when people could not stop talking to me. Unfortunately, this is part of the "culture" where and sometimes people came to just say "hi" and break my concentration entirely.

I'm not a big fan of social networks, so I'm not using them in the last years. Sometimes I decide to get back to some of them just to realize that this book is right on everything about useless time spending.

As an experiment I've been trying deep work on my weekday mornings and for my personal project on weekends. Most of the time I'm using 3-4 hours on the task and it really work the effort. No communication, no social networking, no random internet surfing and more work done.

There is some really good information that bases deep working and helps you to apply it to your life. It will definitely change the way I work.
