Book: [Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34376766) by Jason Schreier. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Good book overall, I did not take notes because it seems like a fictional book. :P

If you like this book I would also recommend you to read [b:Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture|222146|Masters of Doom How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture|David Kushner|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438591316s/222146.jpg|215133] and some chapters of [b:Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution|56829|Hackers Heroes of the Computer Revolution|Steven Levy|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435697935s/56829.jpg|1407224] where they tell some game companies stories.

I would also add [Indie game: the movie][1] (also available on Netflix) to the list of complimentary content.

I was already aware of what would be like to work for a gaming company, but this book also adds some horror stories I was not expecting. The total lack of decent management in Halo Wars is something unbelievable for those working with software in big companies.

The whole story of indie developers was also lovely to see. For some, it's insane to see the number of hours these developers have to work to get the game they want. I usually focus on the result, when the story reaches the end I feel like it worth the work.

I published one small game demo called [Skeleton Jigsaw][2], it took 8 months of my spare time, but I regret nothing. :)

My conclusion about this book: you should definitely read it if you want to work with games. You should also read it if you like games in general, the author explains all the technical terms (which was a little bit boring for me).
