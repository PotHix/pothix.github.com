Book: [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56829) by Steven Levy. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Great book. John Carmack said it was the most inspiring book for him and I can understand why.

The word Hackers is not the same these days, but the Hacker Ethics still lives in some of the programmers out there. Those guys that keep hacking (and/or programming) for hours and hours just for the joy of create and modify things still exists.

It made me think about the old times when I used to use part of my "sleep time" to work on some C++/SDL code just to understand how could I bring 2D game to life with these tools.

This book (and these old hackers) motivated me to bring my hacker lifestyle again. It's time to get back. :)
