Book: [Einstein: His Life and Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10884) by Walter Isaacson. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This is the first biography that I read and I found it amazing.

I knew that Albert Einstein was a genius but it was not just that. He was *extremely* devoted to what he did. I had many quotes from this book and one of them shows what I just said:

"As long as I am able to work, I must not and will not complain, because work is the only thing that gives substance to life"

That was after his second wife died and he was back to the office, still sad.

He had one of the attributes that I wish to have more: the ability to concentrate everywhere.
There are many examples of his ability to concentrate in this book. Some of them are in really crowded and noisy places. His level of concentration is so high that, at one occasion, he was receiving a standing ovation and did not noticed until his friend poked him.

There is much information about Albert Einstein available on the internet, but I had a really different view of him before reading the book. So, I really recommend you to read this book if you want to know more about this fascinating person.
