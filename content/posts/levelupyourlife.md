Book: [Level Up Your Life: How to Unlock Adventure and Happiness by Becoming the Hero of Your Own Story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24615920) by Steve Kamb. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This is a good book but it's not for me.

I already use many of the tips mentioned in this book and they really work.
It makes a good pair with habitica.com, in case you like to play these kinds of games in real life.

There are many great references for the nerds out there. This fact can be a motivator to implement the ideas from characters of your favorite stories.

If you're a nerd that wants to motivate yourself for new challenges or personal organization, this book may be a good fit. Just be warned that it feels like a self-help book (because it is, maybe :P).
