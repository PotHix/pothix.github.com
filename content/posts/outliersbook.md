Book: [Outliers: The Story of Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917) by Malcolm Gladwell. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It was a good reading. I would review this book as 3 stars but at the end, I was convinced that it made me think about many interesting things on successful people in general.

The key point of this book is: what makes successful people is a match of many factors. Some of those factors were not clear to me.

Cultural inheritance is one of those factors. Who were your ancestors? How they lived their life? They probably have some influence on how you lived yours.

Dedication is a key point. Many of the outliers present in this book's study had 10000+ hours of practice in their area before becoming successful.

Access to the right tools at the right time. To have a computer when most people in the world doesn't can make a huge difference on your success rate, for example. Bill gates is an example of that.

My expectation for this book was pretty high, that's the reason for the first sentence of this review, but *it is* a good book.
