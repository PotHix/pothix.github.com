I've been working on my keyboards these days. I current have:

* HHKB Lite (for sale)
* Typematrix (for sale)
* Kinesis Advantage
* Atreus
* Pok3r

The Kinesis advantage is the best keyboard I ever had and I have no plans to sell it. The problem with this keyboard is the size... It's HUGE!

Since Kinesis is not portable at all, I was looking for a great keyboard to
carry with me when I travel. I work remotely and I don't want to work for one
month like a turtle relying on the laptop keyboard only.

For the Pok3r keyboard, I'm using the following layout:
