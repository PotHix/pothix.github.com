Book: [The Wolf of Wall Street (The Wolf of Wall Street, #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522776) by Jordan Belfort. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Did you watch the movie?

Yes: you're done. The book does not add anything relevant IMO.

No: Watch the movie.

In case you prefer books than movies, you may try this one. It is not a bad book and you will see how a smart guy can be a perfect asshole.

The only thing that I absorved from this book is: This kind of life is not for me. I don't want to be rich and use all these expensive artifacts like cars, luxury beds and so on. I really can't see any advantage on it.
