Book: [Managing Oneself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2477223) by Peter F. Drucker. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This book is not life-changing but it's small, straight to the point, and has many terrific bits of advice for your career and life.

I would totally recommend you to read it since it's not expensive and quick to read/listen to (around 1 hour on Audible).

Here are my raw notes about the book:

- Feedback analysis: whenever you take a crucial decision or action take note of
  the results you're expecting. After 8 or 9 months, compare the expected
  results with the actual results
- People think ideas move mountains, but bulldozers move mountains, ideas show
  where the bulldozers should work
- Manners are like oil for a machine; they reduce friction between two bodies
- We have to know ourselves and place ourselves where we can make the most
  significant contribution
- Feedback also shows you what not to do. There is a vast number of areas where
  we don't have the competence to even be mediocre. In this area, a person
  should not take a job or assignment. It takes much more effort and time to go
  from zero knowledge to mediocrity than from improving from first-grade
  performance to excellence
- It's important to know how you perform, so you can adjust yourself to perform
  better
- Are you a reader or a listener? That changes a lot.
- How do you learn? Is it by copying? Writing? Speaking?
- Some people are great as subordinates, but they may be terrible when it's time
  to take the decision
- People in the first spot usually put people they trust in the second spot as
  their advisor. People who don't like to make decisions are generally
  outstanding in this position
- When do you work best? Under stress or a calm environment? When working for
  big companies or small ones? Don't take jobs where you can perform your best
- The mirror test: what kind of person do you want to see in the mirror in the
  morning? Choose what you wish for yourself
- Values are the ultimate test. Make your values align with the company you're
  working for, or you will not be satisfied in the long term.
- You should find what you should do, not just execute what is given. Doing what
  you want to do make you better in life
- Understand relationships. Your co-workers are people like you, with strengths
  and weaknesses. You have to learn how your co-workers work. Example: do not
  write a report to your boss if he is a listener
- Plan the second half of your life. Most knowledge workers get bored after
  working in the same sector for many years but they usually still have a lot of
  productive years ahead. Start a second career or participate/build a
  non-profit organization
