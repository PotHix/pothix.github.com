Book: [The Future of the Professions: How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23462787) by Richard Susskind. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It is a nice idea and the arguments looks valid and make you think about the future.
The book is not easy to follow through and I the first 5 chapters are not so interesting. Most part of the book is an introduction to the main subject that is presented on the last chapters.
