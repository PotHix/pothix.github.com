After many years using [LastPass](https://lastpass.com), I decided to make the
switch to [1Password](https://1password.com). I'm going to describe here why I
did this and how was my process to choose.

## LastPass

I'm using LastPass for many years now. A lot of people say that LastPass is not
a good password manager, it has bugs, it's ugly, [it has too many
trackers](https://www.gsmarena.com/lastpass_for_android_has_seven_builtin_trackers_security_firm_warns-news-47977.php),
yada, yada, yada.

I was always the guy who said: "Yeah, it works for me". I was aware of the
problems of LastPass but I was OK with the what the product was giving me
without asking any money in return.

Although LastPass works for me, there were some annoying bugs. The fact that the
Android app usually don't fill users and passwords is really annoying. It's
basically useless on Android for me. I keep the app there so I can open it and
do the copy & paste myself.

I have nothing to complain about the browser extensions, it usually works as I
expect. It fills in passwords and save new ones when I subscribe to other
services. That's it. ðŸ¤·

LastPass' UI is really weird indeed. It's hard to find where to do stuff because
there's a lot of clutter everywhere. When you get used to it, things work as
expected.

## The move

In the beginning of 2021, I started to consider paying for a password manager
and having a family subscription. I wanted to share some accounts with my wife
and parents. Some accounts are not very personal:

+ Supermarket account to buy groceries
+ Pharmacy account
+ Other accounts related to my babies
+ Streaming accounts with multiple profiles and family subscriptions (Netflix,
  Amazon Prime Video, etc).


I was also looking for a place to start exercising what I call my "Death plan":
"If I die, what is going to happen?". The password manager shared with my family
is a great start.

## The research

I didn't do much research for this. I had some ideas of what I could use and
meet my criteria:

+ LastPass
+ Bitwarden
+ 1Password

### LastPass

I'm already used to it, but I'm not sure if I want to use their paid versions
and I'm a bit skeptical about their choices as a product.

If I'm going to move to a different idea, I will probably choose a different
product.

### Bitwarden

I already use Bitwarden at work and it works fine. There's not much I have to
complain there. Some bullet points:

- The interface is OK-ish.
- It's open source.
- I'm already used to it because I'm using their business plan.
- The price is OK.

I decided to do some research to find out how it's going to be to use them via
business and personal and found out [they don't support it just
yet](https://community.bitwarden.com/t/log-in-with-multiple-bitwarden-user-accounts/716),
which is a no-go to me.

### 1Password

A lot of friends already use it for many years. It's a solid product. I had some
prejudice against them because it was a Apple thing, but now that they are
available everywhere, it's worth trying.

I did their trial and the product is indeed good as people mentioned. Their
online vault is not very user-friendly IMO. It took me some time to understand
how to add and edit stuff. I believe it is related to that "Apple thing" feeling
I always had.

It seems to be the best password manager I can find until now.

## The choice

I just subscribed to 1Password now and I'm enjoying it.  I'm a top 1% Todoist
user and I have a 25% discount on 1Password because of that (for new users
only), which is a big win.

Here is a list of things I like about 1Password:

+ The way to create vaults and share
+ Share passwords with your family is very simple
+ The Android app actually works to fill in passwords (take that LastPass)

I hope it will be a long relationship so I will not have to migrate passwords
again. ðŸ˜…
