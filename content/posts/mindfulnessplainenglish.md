Book: [Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64369) by Henepola Gunaratana. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I was expecting some more but after reading the description again it seems to deliver exactly what it says.

The whole book is about meditation and I would say 50% of it is about focusing on your breathe.
The chapter about loving kindness is also interesting. There are some quotes of Buddha that are really great.

Some of my notes:

* Meditation is not just for holy man. They are holy because they meditate, not the contrary.
* The real peace comes only when you stop chasing it
* Investigate yourself. Take nothing as granted. Question everything. Don't believe in anything because it sound wise or some holy man said, see for yourself.
* Face reality, don't try to mask your problems.
* Suffering is different than pain. Pain is inevitable, you will feel it someday. But suffering you may avoid, be prepared for it.
* Mindfulness is about the present. If you remember your school teacher, that's memory. When you become aware of remembering, that's mindfulness. When you say: "oh, I'm remembering...", That's thinking.
* Concentration is just like a lens, it amplifies your thoughts to go deeper. Use it as a tool.
