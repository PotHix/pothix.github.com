Book: [Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13185350) by Joshua Fields Millburn. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I was expecting more from this book.

I listen to their Podcast and read some articles on their website. This book looks like a list of pointers to their website. I would just recommend it in case you want something to start your journey in minimalism thinking, so you can buy the audiobook and listen to it in your spare time before diving deep into their articles.

As usual, there is some good information here as well. Here are my notes:

* We were not happy, so we tried to buy happiness, and of course, it didn't work
* Minimalism is a tool to help you to achieve freedom
* Eating should be considered nutrition, not entertainment
* Write down things you did last week that doesn't align with the 5 values (health, relationships, passion, growth, and contribution)
* Minimalists don't pursue happiness through things but through life itself
* Eliminate sugar and processed foods from your diet if you want to feel better
* Don't try to change other people, change yourself
* Say goodbye to fake friends and focus on primary relationships

They don't say that as "you must do it!" or "you have to complete this checklist to be a minimalist" but instead, they show some ways to live a better life and recommend you to experiment with them.

I really recommend you to check out their website in case you're interested in the whole minimalism thing. https://www.theminimalists.com/start/
