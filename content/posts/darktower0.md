Book: [The Little Sisters of Eluria (The Dark Tower, #0.5)](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4099311654) by Stephen King. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It's a fun story for those who are into the Dark Tower series. It's a short
story actually, and brings a bit more about Roland's early adventures, happening
a bit before "The Gunslinger".

It doesn't add much to the whole story other than just showing a bit more of a
random place in the Mid-World, but it's still an enjoyable story.
