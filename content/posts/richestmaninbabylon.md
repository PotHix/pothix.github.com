Book: [The Richest Man in Babylon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1052) by George S. Clason. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I just read "rich dad poor dad" before reading this one and I think it ruined my experience. After reading that book first, this one looks like a puzzle you already know the answer.

This book is a series of parables of the "richest man in Babylon" (as you expect) and you need to read the parables understand the context and translate it to your life if you want to get something useful from it. That's what the "rich dad, poor dad" does.

This book is not bad it was just boring for me. Given the size of the book (4h of audio) and the price (less than $3 for an Audible audiobook) it worth it.

Here are some of my notes:

* Don't strain yourself too much, enjoy life. If 10% is all you can conformably keep, then be content to keep this portion
* Small return and safe one is far more desirable than risk
* We usually have more desires than we can gratify unless you contest it
* "I'm a free man, I will enjoy my life more by expending my money on things I like". You build your budget, the idea of the budget is to help you to achieve*everything* you want, not just casual things.
* You have to take an opportunity when it arises. "I don't have time for that now" is for procrastinators
* Five laws of gold
* Wealth that comes quickly goes in the same way
* The soul of a free man looks for problems to solve and solve them. The soul of a slave says: "What can I do, I'm a soul of a slave"
* Where the determination is, the way can be found
* He lived with 70% of his income. Paid his debt with 20% and let 10% to jingle. When he had enough and stabilized his life, he found investment for it
* When you see the wealth of someone, you should see his work as well. Enjoy the work was what made them wealthy
