It's already the end of October and I could not manage to post my stats
from September but I have a good reason for that (which you will read
about in the next month 😉).

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

[What Doesn’t Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength](http://amzn.to/2kusAgC) is
a book that describes what the human body can do if trained for it. The writing
process is not so good for my taste, sometimes it looks like a memoir, sometimes
it's non-fiction... but the message it passes is really interesting. The
evolution did a lot of work for us but we're kind of using technology to do some
stuff for us and losing part of what we developed. I recommend it, BTW.

It was **really** less books read then last month, but it's ok. I had a lot of
pressing things to do this month.


### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1214
898
```

It means I have **1214 articles Unread** and **898 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (1157 unread and
883 read), I got around **5% more unread articles** and **2%
more read articles**.

I did not take so much time for articles reading this month, so the numbers
increased less than they use to. It was also affected by the time it took to
generate the numbers last month.

Another correlation with this one may be related to the fact that I'm
only reading my Feedly once a week instead of every day, that helps a
lot to not add many articles to Pocket. :)

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

As usual, it's kind of the average with one outlier. This average of 3-4 hours
coding always bugs me.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/sep/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I don't know why `markdown` always takes the lead (after `bash`), but `Python` is coming as it should.

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/sep/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Nothing new to editors. I still use Vim, but Emacs is the leader by far.

### Speaking

+ [Fazendo um snake game com Python 3 e PyGame para se divertir](https://www.meetup.com/Grupy-SP/events/243214891/) at [GruPy-SP](https://www.meetup.com/Grupy-SP/)
+ [Lightning talk: Brincando com API's e jq](https://youtu.be/EXwT8gM-YfU?t=12823) at [Guru-SP](https://gurusp.org)

This was an ordinary month regarding presentations, but still following what I
had defined for my goal:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/sep/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/sep/presentations.png "")

The goal was reached this month! I will try to keep the same rhythm and maybe
speak in different countries in October. :)

### Completed tasks

This is the amount of tasks completed on [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2017/sep/tasks-completed.png)

**365 tasks** completed this month (**169 less** than last month 😞).

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/sep/podcasts.jpg)

**1 day and 16 hours** of podcast time, almost 1 day more than last month. As I
said in the previous month, when I listen to less audiobooks I usually have more
time spent on podcasts. 😄

I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/sep/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/sep/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just remember that this is an "all time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here is the data from my time tracking software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. Currently it's just
my full-time job, because there are some stuff preventing me to work on my
freelance.

Here is the difference between shallow and deep work regarding my full-time job:

[![Deep vs Shallow work](/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "Deep vs Shallow work")](/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "")

It was less deep work than last month (10 hours less) but it's good to know I'm
still spending around 1/3 of my time in Deep Work state. I'm also tracking time
in meetings and it was half of the time spend last month. 😁

There is another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/sep/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

A little bit more personal projects but they are all related to my
presentations. :)

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/sep/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/sep/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

Unfortunately I had a problem with Rescue time this month (and probably next
month too, we're debugging it) and my data is not being collected properly. 😢

But there is not just bad news for this case! I now have a partnership with
rescuetime and have access to a premium account. Thanks rescuetime team! 😁

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/sep/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/sep/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of **8.6k**
steps (258/30). It was almost 50k more steps than last month, which is really good.

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/sep/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **9.2km**:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/sep/physical-activity-distance.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/sep/sleep.jpg "")

Less average sleeping (**7h49m** for the last month) and also less deep
sleeping for this month (last month was **1h48**).

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 50 episodes this
month! It's a personal record but I'm not sure if this is good or bad.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/sep/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/sep/tvshows.jpg "")

It's a combination of **The defenders**, **Marvel agents of shield (season 4)**
and **Orphan Black (seasons 1-3)**.

Unfortunately I got the results too late and I can't calculate how many hours I
spent watching TV this month. 😢

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

My stats for this month:

+ **73969** words written (**69493** last month)
+ **1826** corrections made (**1881** last month)
+ **17139** unique words (**13925** last month)

The numbers keep rising because all of my work conversations are in English and
that's nice. I had **more than 6% more words written** , around **19% more
unique words** and **3% less corrections made** (!!).

It was great to see less corrections made this month, it seems I'm improving! 😄

### Locations

For some reason, there is 1 city less than next month. I really don't know how
Google calculates that. 😞 But visited 11 places this month.

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/sep/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/sep/location-general.png "")

Here is the time spend in vehicles:

[![Location time and distance](/images/stats/2017/sep/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance")](/images/stats/2017/sep/location-time-distance.png "")

Just 10 hours spent in transport, that's great. :)

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2017/sep/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2017/sep/location-moon.png "")

Hope to reach the moon some day.

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/sep/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/sep/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this month**. The number is not wrong,
I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described in
the
[last](/post/stats-jul-2017) [three](/post/stats-jun-2017/) [months](/post/stats-aug-2017) still
persists, for this reason, there's no money coming yet. :(

So... the situation is the same... My wife is paying all of our bills until my
situation gets back to normal. I'm stressed with this situation but it's great
to have someone to rely on when things like these happen. ❤️

Unfortunately I did not checked all my finances in the beginning of the month,
so I can't tell how it was. I will keep the same value as the last month, so I
still reached **74.23%** of my goal.


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.

**It took 3 hours and 16 minutes to write this post**

I wrote part of it during an airplane travel so its approximate.


### Conclusion

Again... excluding the fact of not being able to receive my payment because of
bureaucracy that has nothing to do with what I do, this month was good. I had to
rush to get everything setup for my travel in the next month but it was cool.

I'm already aware that the next month will be really different because I will
take 1 week off and will work from different locations. Let's see how it goes.
