A lot happened since [my last post](/dactyl1) and all parts are already here! üòÉ

It was expected that I would not have that much time to work on the keyboard
when all the parts arrive, this will be a long journey. The only thing that I
wanted to do as soon as possible was to check if the products were in a good
condition.

These are cheap parts coming from China in a month-long journey, so it's
important to check if they are working as expected while I still can open a
dispute with the seller if something is wrong.

Most parts are very simple:

I tested the switches with a multimeter just to be sure they were doing their
job. It's a simple continuity test: Each probe touching one pin and pressing
the switch to "hear the beep".

The part that I was mostly interested in was the microcontrollers:

![Both microcontrollers](/images/posts/dactyl2/microcontroller.jpg)

I bought a cheap Arduino promicro and I wanted to be sure it was working. To do
that, I connected it to the computer via micro-USB cable and flashed QMK into
it.

**Note:** It's important to be sure you are using a good cable that transmits
both data and power. I was initially using a simple cable I have here that
doesn't transmit cable and was quite sad none of my microcontrollers were
working ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ.

A [friend of mine](https://twitter.com/rhruiz) recommended me to try the
Laplace firmware for the test because it was very simple to check and that's
what I did.

The process is straightforward:

1. Connect the microcontroller via micro-USB
1. It should be recognized on `dmesg` (when using the right cable üôÑ) and light up the red led
1. You need to reset it by shorting the right pins
1. Run the flash command for the firmware chosen

The steps **1** and **2** don't need further description but let's go through
the steps **3** and **4**.

## Reset the promicro

To reset the promicro, you will need a tweezer (preferred) or anything that you
can use to short the two pins. Than you have to short the RST and GND pins
while connected.

After shorting, you will see a different output on your `dmesg` (I suggest
keeping a `dmesg -w` running.

## Flash the firmware

The process was quite simple. I just connected the microcontroller, went to the
qmk firmware directory and ran the following command right after reseting the
promicro:

```
make keebio:laplace:default:avrdude
```
and voil√†:

## Testing the promicro

Now that the micro controller already has a firmware loaded, I decided to test
some of the connections to be sure it was working as expected. Again you will
need your tweezers and the microcontroller connected to the computer.

I used [xev](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xev) to test. It only receives any
events received by the X server on Linux.

I [used the matrix pins described on laplace's
firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/keebio/laplace/config.h#L34)
and started shorting. I was able to find ESC and DELETE, so I considered it as
a working hardware. üéâ

That's the simplest way I found (with some help, of course üòâ) to test the
microcontroller without assembling the keyboard. Hope it's useful to someone
else.
