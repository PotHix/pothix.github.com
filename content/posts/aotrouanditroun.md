Book: [The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31122069) by J.R.R. Tolkien. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It's an OK book if you're a Tolkien fan.

For those who like Tolkien and everything he researched, it's an interesting book to read. I would not recommend this book to someone who's not into Tolkien.

There are three poems in this book and it tries to tell a story about how Tolkien wrote the final poem. None of them are that great alone but together they show one particular part of Tolkien's style of writing/researching.
