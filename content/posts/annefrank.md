Book: [The Diary of a Young Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48855) by Anne Frank. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Just decided to read it because I'm planning to visit Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam.

It was OK. Most part of it is just what you expect from a diary of a 14 years old girl. There are some interesting parts about what is going on in the war scene outside and how it affects all people living in the secret annex. The historical context of the war can be perceived between one sentence and another.
