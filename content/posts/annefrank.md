Book: [The Diary of a Young Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48855) by Anne Frank. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I decided to read this book one month before visiting the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam. My plan is to use the whole context of the book to have the full experience when visiting the museum.

The book is OK. Most part of it is just what you expect from a diary of a 14 years old girl, even with the whole context implied. There are some interesting parts about what is going on in the war scene outside and how it affects all people living in the secret annex. The historical context of the war can be perceived between one sentence and another.

After visiting the museum, things became more vivid. Life in the secret annex was not an easy task. Just living there all the time would be a hard task, but living there knowing that someone may find and kill you at any time is terrifying.

This is the kind of book that is becomes much more interesting when you have more context. Visiting the museum brought the context I needed.
