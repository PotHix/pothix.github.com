Book: [TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25897871) by Chris J. Anderson. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

There are some cool tips in this book but it's not so straight to the point if you're just looking for speaking tips. If you like to speak at IT events (like I do) I really recommend http://speaking.io.

This book shows the way to deliver a presentation that earns a standing ovation at the end. It makes sense, that's TED. So, if you're passionate about TED's way of presenting or want to speak at TED someday, this book will be great for you.

It's a good book, I got some interesting insights about public speaking, but it was less than I was expecting.

Three stars: Good book, but be warned. :)
