Book: [TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25897871) by Chris J. Anderson. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

There are some cool tips in this book but it's not so straight to the point if you're just looking for speaking tips. If you like to speak at IT events (like I do) I really recommend http://speaking.io.

This book shows the way to deliver a presentation that earns a standing ovation at the end. It makes sense, that's TED. So, if you're passionate about TED's way of presenting or want to speak at TED someday, this book will be great for you.

It's a good book, I got some interesting insights about public speaking, but it was less than I was expecting.

Three stars: Good book, but be warned. :)

Here are my notes for this book:

- Give, not take. Your presentation should not be a sales pitch, it should give knowledge to the attendees.
- To not waste the audience's time. Don't say you're not prepared for the talk or was just thinking about what to say some minutes before.
- Inspiration can't be performed
- Answer the questions: what, so what, now what
- Search for the checklist of the chapter 5.
- Connection: be personal. Sfeak their language. Make eye contact.
- If you're nervous, show it, the audience will be with you
- Fazer uma pergunta parr despertar a curiosidade, então partir para a explicação
- Use metaphor whenever possible. JavaScript async pants and underwear
- Use arguments like reduce to absurd when trying to get the audience to understand your point
- Wondertalk. Show awesome images and concepts to demo your idea
- Find fantastic arguments, like said in the "man to the moon" speech
- Slides com perguntas e responder falando
- Evite fotos suas ou do seu time. Foque na audiência, não em você. Use se fizer sentido para contar a história.
- Make a good planning for the starting and ending of yoar presentation.
- If your talk was a novel, how would you start it?
- You don't need to walk. Just stad tall and use os arms to amplify what you're saying.
- If you decide to walk, do it intentionally or you will look nervous.
- To speak fast is better than speaking too slow.
