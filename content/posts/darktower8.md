Book: [The Wind Through the Keyhole](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4086228715) by Stephen King. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I wish I have read this book in chronological order. The book is not bad, but
reading it right after finishing the series just because it was released
afterwards was not a good call. On the other hand, I'm wondering if I would have
enough motivation to continue reading the series if I read this book right after
book 4. I remember I was missing real stories (not flashbacks) when I finished
book 4.

That's it, mixed feelings about this one. It was great to expand a bit more the
knowledge about the Eagle and Lion beam and finally seeing a bit more about
Maerlyn, but I also didn't care about the main characters as much as I did
before finishing the main story.

I believe it's still worth reading if you're into the Dark Tower series, but if
possible, read it in chronological order.
