Book: [The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186) by Gene Kim. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This is a great book for IT folks.

In case you worked (or still work) in a big company with lots of ITIL things that holds the development, this book will be like home for you.

It is a typical hero's journey and the characters are not so well developed (IMO) but the story is still good to follow. I've created many ideas for the ending and none of them were true, it made me give credits to the authors for not make it obvious.

The book is a fictional novel but it has some truth in it. ;)

Here are my raw notes about the book:

- Improve daily work is more important than doing daily work
- Improvement kata - daily improvement
