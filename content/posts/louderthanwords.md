Book: [Louder Than Words: The New Science of How the Mind Makes Meaning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13587146) by Benjamin K. Bergen. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

A good book, but maybe it's not for me.

I really like books that have a lot of research behind it, this is one of them. For almost every assumption made, the author reveals a research done to support his point.

This book made me realize that our words do not give a meaning for something. Example: the word "pen" is not the meaning of something that writes with ink, it is just a pointer to that meaning. The meaning is the source that we generate. When you learn a different language, you're pointing to this same meaning.

Sometimes this meaning can be made of sounds, smells, movements, and so on. A meaning is a different thing for different people.

The thing with simulation is really interesting. We use the same part of the brain to do an action and to simulate it. The same area of the brain activates for executing an action, thinking about an action and understanding a word about an action.

Expertise affects how people understand words. It may look obvious but sometimes we forget that some concepts that are obvious to us are not obvious to someone else.

This book also comments about a TMS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation) and how it may interfere with how we speak. But the interesting thing about this experiment is that it also interferes on how we talk to ourselves when stimulating the "talking area" of the brain. That happens because we use the same area to speak and to talk to ourselves.

The book talks a lot about the English grammar and it's not so good for non-native English speakers (like me).

The book is good and there were some interesting insights, but some part were just tedious for me.
