Book: [The Coming Storm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41016100) by Michael   Lewis. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

A nice and informative book. It's not outstanding but I found it to have great information about how data can change the way we live, especially in this case where human lives may be in danger. The whole thing about the way the U.S. government deal with their data department is weird, but at least they have one. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Here are my notes for this small book:

- Why the government has to invest in weather prediction if people are getting info from AccuWeather? Mostly because there are conflicts of interest in the private sector
- The man chosen by Trump to have the government data doesn't have an issue with bending the truth
- The government have to find a way to make the news feel real
- We should not spread news without understanding people
- People living in Mobile homes have 30x more chances to die in a hurricane
- It seems to be all a matter of trust in the government warning for tornadoes
