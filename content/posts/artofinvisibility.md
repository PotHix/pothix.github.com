Book: [The Art of Invisibility: The World's Most Famous Hacker Teaches You How to Be Safe in the Age of Big Brother and Big Data](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30363785) by Kevin D. Mitnick. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It is not new to me that we have a lot of security flaws everywhere. Yes, it's scary, but that's what you sign for when you decide to use the internet.

He shows some things you can do to be anonymous but it's tough and you usually don't need it to live a normal life. By "normal life" I mean: "I don't care about my privacy. I know companies are spying what I do and I'm OK with that". I'm not saying that it's OK not to have privacy, but that's what happens in the current state of the communications we have, live with it, or you will be paranoid.

There are some excellent tips in this book for those who want to make things harder for non-security people/algorithms to trace their lives. I would recommend this book to everyone thinking he/she is secure because they have a green padlock next to their URL.

There are not so many notes on this book, but here are some of them:

* Lock your phone with more than four digits
* If you want to secure some device, start with your phone, it's the most vulnerable
* Use strong security answers, they should not be obvious
* 2FA asks for three things. It's usually: what do you have (bank card, cell phone), what do you know (pin), who you are (facial recognition, fingerprint)
* Use a Tor browser mentioned on Tor website
* Use Https everywhere extension
* Ghostery browser plugin
* Someone with access to your phone can see all your friends and your past location (a lot of info here)
* Currently, you can't control your privacy anymore. Anyone can have a camera and take pictures of you on the street
