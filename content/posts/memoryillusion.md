Book: [The Memory Illusion: Remembering, Forgetting, and the Science of False Memory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29610119) by Julia  Shaw. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

The whole point of this book is to show that our memories are not reliable.
We can't be sure that something happened because a lot of things may influence our past memories.

The good argument in favor of this book is its references. There are many references for academic studies. The bad part is that it is not so comfortable to read, the language is not that good.

At the end, you will learn some interesting facts about how your memory work.
