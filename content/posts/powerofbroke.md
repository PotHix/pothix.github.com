Book: [The Power of Broke: How Empty Pockets, a Tight Budget, and a Hunger for Success Can Become Your Greatest Competitive Advantage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25430691) by Daymond John. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

An ordinary book. 3 stars are good enough.

The whole book discusses how to do business when you have no money. Daymond is the man behind Fubu and a TV show called Shark Tank. His story is really interesting to follow because he raised his entire business out of nothing, following the power of broke principle.

Throughout the book, he shows similar stories to show the power of broke in action. It's a good principle but nothing extraordinary. If you need motivation or are using excuses because "you don't have enough money" this book may be good for you.

Some of my notes:

* When you got nothing to lose, you got everything to gain
* Innovation goes bottom up, not top down
* If you don't have the opportunity, build one for yourself
* When you're broke, you have to make smart decisions, or it will cost your whole business
* Put your passion on everything you do.
