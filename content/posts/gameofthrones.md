Book: [A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496) by George R.R. Martin. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It's a great book.

I know ASOIAF from the TV show "Game of Thrones". This book was the first one I bought at Audible but decided to not start with it (33hs of content). As the 7th season of the TV show started, I decided to gather more information about the whole plot.

In case you watched the TV show, you will follow the books easily. The first season of Game of Thrones is loyal to what happened in the book. For me, it was a good reading as I don't remember many things I watched some years ago.

I could feel the feelings of some characters in a different way when reading this book. A good example is how Tyrion likes/trust Jon Snow, it was not clear for me in the TV show. The whole plot with Jon Arryn was not so clear for me as well and it was clarified in this book.

In summary, it's a great book, with or without the TV show. In case you're following the TV show, it will be a great reading with a lot more details.
