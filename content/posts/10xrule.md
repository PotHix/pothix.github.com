Book: [The 10x Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10339170) by Grant Cardone. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I really like this book. I would recommend it if you are the kind of person that wants to make a difference in the world and want to be remembered in the future generations. The book will not give you that but if you follow a methodology like it recommends you will get closer to your big goals.

Some things that I learned:

* Always multiply your goal by 10. You will have to think differently about the problem when you do that. By having such a big goal, you will need to attack it with massive action.

* Don't worry about what the society thinks about you. Most people decided to be mediocre (part of the average people, and that's ok) and they will criticize you because you're not "living your life". Just remember that success is your duty.

* Fear is a good thing, it mean you're going to learn new things and conquer new places. Don't be afraid to do things.

* Forget about excuses, it will just give you a reason to "be on average". Instead of using excuses, do what have to be done.
