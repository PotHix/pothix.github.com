Book: [Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036) by Cal Newport. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I'm a big fan of the "Deep work" book and this is another great book from Cal Newport. This one is not life-changing as "Deep work" was for me, but it brings great insights on technology in general.

I'm not a big fan of social networks in general, they are mostly a waste of time in my point of view. Cal shows something even worst about them in this book, which is how companies explore your attention. This is something I saw in many other books already, but this one goes a bit more deeply on the topic. It makes me reconsider many of the apps I still use.

Currently, I'm a hard user of the DnD (Do not Disturb) mode of my phone, so I receive almost no notifications. From time to time, I disable the DnD mode and there they are, many notifications of things "I have to see". This will be the next step of my quest, remove the apps or at least silence them all.

This book is great and I know MANY people that would benefit from the tips here. The main problem is that these people do not care much about spending their time on these apps. With that in mind, I will still recommend it to some or at least try to exemplify the problems, maybe they will change their mind (or maybe not, and it's fine).

Here are my notes about this book:

The biggest companies in social media should admit they are tobacco sellers of our time, selling addictive drugs to children in the form of likes
Non Profit: time well spent
Irresistible book
Unpredictable positive reinforcement triggers our will to do things more (receive likes)
Social networks exploit our craving for social approval. The number of likes shows the group approves what you're doing
Digital minimalists are OK on losing small things to focus on others that make their lives good. e.g. the small advantages of Facebook doesn't pay for the overall problems of using it
Choose the right technology and use it in a meaningful way that goes in the same way as your goals
Clutter is costly. Many apps may have such a negative effect that surpass the positive effect of apps isolated
One should not only consider the financial return if things, but also the amount of lifetime invested
While considering the advantages of social media, take into account the time you're spending to have that advantage. Does it worth it? Is it the best way to achieve what you want? Be deliberate about it.
Many people limit Netflix to social events like watching with their partners -- that's exactly what I do
