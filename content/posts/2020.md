**Brace yourselves, like any other stats post, this one will be HUGE**

If you're following my blog, you know that I sometimes mentioned things were too
hard and I couldn't sit down and write. Looking back now, I have a good laugh
for my past self. ☺️

I can say for sure that 2020 was a complicated year and **a lot** of things
changeg in my life. The biggest change is that I'm now a father of twins. I
still remember when a colleague mentioned: "I'm curious to see how your metrics
post will be next year". Well, I'm curious too, so let's see.

## Average day

I'd like to start with what an average day is to me according to
[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix) because it feels like a TL;DR
of this post:

[![A list of data showing how a day works. Starts with a sleep of 7 hours and a half, 3 hours and a half of productive time, 11 tracks, 1 tweet, 2 hours of distracting time, almost 9 thousand steps, an average of 4 for my rating and going to sleep at 11h30](/images/stats/2020/yir/exist-average-day.png "My day according to Exist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/exist-average-day.png "")

There's one thing I'm certain about this: I'm not weighting 78.1kg. 😂 I
probably forgot to add my weight to mi-fit this year because the gym is not a
reality anymore.

## Books

[![Year in books from Goodreads. Shows "On the shortness of life" as the shortest book and "Homo Deus" as the longest one. "The power of habit" is the most popular book. I read 6291 pages across 25 books this year](/images/stats/2020/yir/goodreads-year-in-books-logo.png "My year in books by Goodreads")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

I had a much smaller goal this year. Instead of setting ~30 books, I just set 10
because I was sure my year would be totally different than anything I was used
to. There was also the feeling that having goals were influencing my choice of
books to read, so I wanted to try something different.

I'm glad to meet the modest mark of 10 books this year. It was not stressful and
quite easy to reach the goal. I will probably do the same for 2021, if I read
more than that (I don't think it's going to happen), it would be better than
having a bigger goal and not be able to accomplish it.

You can see my 2020 Goodreads challenge
[here](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621-2020-reading-challenge). :)

I used [Google keep](https://keep.google.com) to take notes of all the books I
read until the end of 2020 and I'm now using [Roam
research](https://roamresearch.com) for that. All my notes are being
consolidated there. Every time I finish a book, I review my notes and post them
along with a review on Goodreads and on this blog. The plan is to migrate all my
reviews here so I can own my content again.

If you want to see the reviews I already migrated, check the
[books](/tags/books) out. If you see I didn't migrate all the titles yet, you
can always look for my whole [list of books read in
2020](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2020)
on Goodreads.

Here are some stats provided by Goodreads comparing all the books I
have registered:

[![A list by year with progress bars. The biggest one is from 2017, the second is 2018, and 2020 is the third one most filled](/images/stats/2020/yir/goodreads.png "List of books read by year")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

I can see now that I'm reducing the number of books I'm reading every year, but
I don't think I should be concerned about that. The number should not surpass
the quality of books and how much I'm applying what I learn.

One of my concerns was related to the quality on my reviews. In 2018 I had a lot
of 3 star reviews, so I tried to improve my picks in 2019 and got some
improvements. Let's see how was 2020:

[![The years of 2020, 2019, and 2018 and their book ratings by me](/images/stats/2020/yir/goodreads-details.png "Comparison between 2018, 2019, and 2020")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

Things are much better! For the first time I have more 5 star reviews than 4
stars! 🤩 This is one of the reasons why I love to have metrics, they help me
realize what I've been doing and improve 💪.

As it happened last year, but after writing this section I'm feeling even better
about the number of books I read this year and their quality.

## Articles

The articles section for this year will be quite interesting because I decided
to migrate my articles from Pocket to Todoist. I found I had a lot of things on
Pocket that were worth reading but some others and didn't make sense anymore
(e.g. the macroeconomic news of 2017).

When I used the same old script I used for the previous year, the result was
quite... interesting:

In 2020, I had **484 articles unread and 3091 articles read** compared with 2019
that I had **1908 articles unread and 1731 articles read**, it's quite a
difference.

It doesn't mean that I read 1500 articles this year (Exist says I read 996
articles), but at least I'm sure there were 500+ garbage articles there.

When checking my Todoist project, I can see I have **149 completed tasks there**
and I can trust this value now. ✅

The result of this metric is not very good because I messed up with my numbers.
Let's consider I read 149 articles this year, it's not that bad compared to the
275 I read last year, but the number is decreasing every year. Let's see what is
going to happen in 2021.

## Coding

All my coding metrics are provided by
[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix). When we have a light blue bar inside
a dark blue one, it means the light one is the global average and the dark one
is the top coder. We should usually focus on the **light blue part of the bar**.

First, let's take a look at the total time coding:

[![Coding stats for this year. I logged 313 hours and my best day was March 21](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png "Total time coding this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

My daily average this year is even lower than the 1h16 per day I got in 2019,
which looks really low for me. I'm still above the average, but 51 mins on
average is a bit weird 😐. The only thing that makes me feel better here is that
I'm not the only one who had its time decreased, it seems to be a general thing.

[Last year](/2019/) I said I was going to tweak the parameters on Wakatime but I
didn't do that. It seems I should give this a try now to see if it better adapts
to my programming style. 🤔

[![Projects followed by their progress bars](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png "Total time coding by project this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

It's nice to see that I dedicated 50+ hours to this blog. I just had a
conversation about this on Twitter and it really takes time to create something
great. I did a good revamp here and improved the content a lot. I'm proud of
what I created here.

The [twist-rs](https://github.com/PotHix/twist-rs) is an experiment of a
multi-language library I was doing using Rust. Nothing production ready, but it
was part of a "Personal DO" at Doist, where I could research anything I wanted
and may be useful for the company.

I dedicated only 22 hours to this blog, compared to 80+ hours in 2017. I would
like to improve this, but I'm not sure if it will be a priority, unfortunately.

Most of my time was developing the Todoist REST API written in Golang, which is
nice to see here. I'm still working on [Todoist](https://todoist.com) but in a different repository now.

I still keep the same freelance job I have for more than 5 years now. It became
almost a personal project for me. The good part of working for them is that the
work is just coding and mostly fixing bugs. I just need to sit down and write some
code.

I'm certain that I worked more than 18 hours during the year, that's the main
reason why I have to tune Wakatime. I usually don't work much for them because I
don't have that much time to spare anymore, but 1.5 hour a month is certainly
not right.

I liked to see [awesome-dactyl](https://github.com/PotHix/awesome-dactyl) and
`qmk_firmware` here. It means I dedicated some time to my custom keyboards
hobbies this year. ⌨

[![Total time by OS and editors. The top coder has a very big progress bar while mine is 20% of that](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png "Total time coding by editor and OS this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I'm just using Linux, so it's expected to have it here. I'm using it much more
than the average as we can see. The "top coder" is an outlier for sure. 😜

In 2019 I was transitioning back to Vim from Emacs and now the transition is
fuly done. It's been a while since I don't open Emacs. I still miss Magit, but
other than that, life is good on the Vim side.

[![A list of 4 languages along with their progress bars. Dark blue is very long and light blue very small](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png "Total time coding by language this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

It's very funny to see Markdown as the most used language this year. OK, I
write a lot in markdown, but it shouldn't be "my most used programming language"
😂.

I believe it's all related to the way Wakatime tracks things and the way I deal
with this. When I'm writing specs or blog posts, I just sit down in front of a
text editor and write. When I'm writing code there's much more research and
testing involved and I believe it makes all the different for Wakatime tracking.

It was weird to see **Python** as the last in this list (the list is actually
much longer, but I decided to cut it there) because **Python** is currently the
primary language at Doist for the backend team. I'm not part of the backend team
anymore and it may have its effects. Have it below Ruby was certainly strange.
🤔

Go as the first programming language was expected. I spent most of the previous
year maintaining a Golang API. ☺️

I'm so happy to see Rust there, even knowing it's not a language I'm using at
work, but it means I gave it the attention I wanted. ❤️

## Speaking

OMG, speaking! 😅 2020 was so crazy that I can't even talk about speaking that
much. I still maintain my [talks page](/talks) and I'm going to use it as a
reference here.

+ **In 2020, I spoke 2 times, one in English and the other in Portuguese. One
  internal (for Doist) and the other for the Future of Work Brasil conference**

Not much difference from 2019 and we had a pandemic this time. The only
difference is that I did both presentations online, which is something I'm not
used to. I love to be in conferences and doing things online is just a bit sad.

In 2020 we were organizing Rust LATAM again, this time it would be in Mexico but
we decided to cancel the conference as soon as the WHO declared the pandemic.
Being an international conference organizer in the middle of a pandemic is very
tough. We were able to cancel everything without major problems thanks to the
Rust community and Mozilla. I'm not sure I'm going to participate in any such
adventure as the main organizer again.

I decided to collaborate with Rustfest global this year, but I was mostly a
spectator and helper with anything related to Rust LATAM than a real organizer.


## Completed tasks

Every year Todoist releases an astonishing Year in review. Here is mine from
[2017](https://todoist.com/review/2017/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJ1QWNKZHhCQyIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxN30.zJQ9q-v1pyL1HwerqktZyNMLSwC7RxC0CKHUNdkoZQI),
[2018](https://todoist.com/review/2018/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJFaklzQ3BBeiIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOH0.2EMtZYiOkn8QjLUZjfgccy5ZUyfYtV5uGHfGgDSU1lQ),
[2019](https://todoist.com/review/2019/eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1aWQiOjUwNTQ0NDMsInllYXIiOjIwMTksImp0aSI6Inp2ak95WHNsIn0.1AJBbnu1cQ8l9N7HUgDCMZmGfPVjHntgdStdRW7IA8M),
and now
[2020](https://todoist.com/review/2020/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJmeU1mckJqdSIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOX0.HwRgJULd8lDN6FjCC5tcrMYVegrXQCk_X6D713bV14E),
which is the one we're going to explore.

Now that I work for Doist, everything I say here will be considered as the
default because "I have to say good things about the company I work", but what
I'm saying here I really mean it and I would certainly say that if I was not
working for Doist.

What the team does is incredible. My jaw dropped when I saw the year in review.
The attention to details and the perpective of the world in such a difficult and
unpredictable scenario is just amazing.

With that said, let's check my Todoist tasks! 🙂

[![A text saying I completed 4938 tasks in 2020. An average of 13 tasks per day.](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed.png "Tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed.png "")

4938 tasks is much less than 2019, when I completed 6198 tasks. I believe this
happened because I decided to remove some scheduling tasks I was maintaining
before. It was so predictable that I mentioned this last year. 😉

The day I complete the most is on **Thursday**, not Friday anymore as it happened last year:

[![Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account. I complete an average of 17 completed tasks every Thursday](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png "Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed.png "")

**My most productive time is 10:00**, it did not change compared to 2019. This
makes sense since [I'm a third bird and feel more productive in the
morning](/productivity-workflow).

It's nice to see I'm consistent using Todoist to manage my tasks:

[![Many small squares filled in scales of gray regarding the tasks I completed by day on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "Tasks completed by day on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "")

I'm still one of the 1% heavy users of Todoist! 😃 The image also shows that I'm
a Grand Master close to become Enlightened. I'm writing this post in February,
so I'm Enlightened already. ✨

[![Orange background with some spheres. The text says I have 11069 karma points and I'm one of the top 1% users of Todoist](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-top-1.png "Top 1% user of Todoist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-top-1.png "")

Seeing the data I found interesting patterns. The first one is that I don't care
much about the karma streaks, I just ignore them. My logest streak was 2 weeks
😅.

The majority of my completed tasks were not priority ones:

[![Three horizontal bars with the percentage of priority tasks.](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-priorities.png "Percentage of tasks by priority")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-priorities.png "")

This is something I want to improve this year. I want to use the priorities
better. 💡

## Podcasts

[![Print screen of an Android phone showing a set of stats from the Podcast Addict app. It's empty.](/images/stats/2020/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "Time listening to Podcasts this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "")

The image speaks by itself. I decided to reset my cellphone this year and didn't
even care to backup the data I had because there was not much to backup.

Without going for a walk with the dog every day in the morning and without my
daily gym workout there's not much space for podcasts and audiobooks anymore.
I'm doing my best to keep [audiobooks](/audiobooks) going, but it's hard to
prioritize podcasts.

This year, there's not much to show here but I stil want to keep the section.
Hopefully, next year things will be better. 🤞


## Hours working, focusing and distractions

Let's start checking all my data tracked using [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![A bar chart for the year of 2020. They look similar in general but with changes in different months.](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time-comparison.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

Comparing to the last year, I have much less hours tracked this year. In the
past year I had 3 bars touching 255h and this year there's not even 255h in the
chart.

Let's check my time working, considering my full-time job only:

[![Bar chart for the year of 2020. The average seems to be around 150 hours. There's a list of categories at the bottom showing, deep work, meeting, and shallow work](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time-fulltime-job.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

It's interesting too see that charts didn't change much for my main job. It
means just just had to de-prioritize anything outside of my work.

June is empty because it was the month when my babies left the ICU (yeah, they
spent 40 days there, tough times, topic for a different post) and came home.
That was when my paternity leave started. I decided to take one month of or
paternity leave and then spread the rest of my time throughout the year.

It's much harder this year to get to a good math about how many hours in average
I'm working every day. I try to have at least 8 hours of work every day and this
year it's even harder to overwork because there are many creatures deserving
attention at home now and there's not time to overwork.

**I spent 87 hours of my year in meetings**, which is 6 hours more than I did
last year.  Most of them were weekly sync meetings with my remote team and also
a monthly 1-on-1 with the head of my team.  I consider most of those meetings
productive, maybe not the checkins but this is something to consider and raise
the flag if they don't feel productive. I like the way people see those things,
it's not blingdly doing meetings because it "is the right way to do it".

The most interesting part for me is the Shallow x Deep work ratio. I can see
things improved since last year. Last year I realized I had
almost 3 times less time Deep working than Shallow working but now it seems to
be much better and **close to half of the shallow work as Deep work**.

To give a bit more context, **I consider Deep work any work I can do without
distraction**. Shallow work is the work I do while I have other tabs opened on
my browser or while I'm doing something else on the side.

As I mentioned in my previous review, I keep one freelance job, which feels like
a personal project to me. I like to improve the app and make it better. I don't
have freelance gigs, but this one I'm happy to keep. Here is the time I tracked
about it this year (based on Toggl, not totally accurate):

[![Bar chart. The first half of the year is much better than the second half.](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-freelance.png "Chart for time working in my freelance job")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-freelance.png "")

Here it's very clear to see when my paternity life started. The life of a new
parent, especially of twins, is tough. Everyone needs attention and you don't
have time for anything. External work, even the one I like to do, had to be
de-prioritized.

The average hours per month is close to 10 last year, much less than I used to
do in the past.

### Productivity data via Rescuetime

Let's check what [rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) has to say
about my productivity. I'm going to use their [year in
review](https://www.rescuetime.com/year-in-review/2020) to extract metrics.

Let's look at the productive and distracting hours for the entire year:

[![An infographic with information for every month of 2020 in small bars and text about productivity. My productivity pulse is 58](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir.png "Rescuetime year in review metrics for 2020")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir.png "")

In December I started configuring my new laptop and rescue time decided to not
report my data for some reason. It will be radio silent in December and January
2021. 😕

I love to see that my productivy pulse incresed for the third year in a row: 51
in 2018, 54 in 2019, and **58 in 2020**. ❤️

They also provide a chart with the categories I used the most:

[![A strange-looking chart in a circular format. The lines above go towards the border showing which category I used the most. Communication & scheduling is the most used.](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "Most used categories according to rescuetime")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "")

I'm usually concerned about the amount of time I spend on communication and
scheduling, which means mostly Telegram and Twist. I'm glad to see that it
decreased from 42% in 2019 to **37% in 2020** 🎉.

The dashboard shows similar information but with some other things:

[![The rescuetime dashboard showing metrics for the entire year. The productivity pulse is 56](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png "Rescuetime dashboard data for 2020")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png "")

The productivity pulse is usually different in the dashboard, I have no idea why 🤷.

In the beginning of the previous year, I defined some goals in rescuetime but
didn't check them during the year. Looking at them now, it doesn't feel very
good:

[![A chart showing my goal for this year. It was 900 hours and 30 mins in total and 783 all productive time](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-goals.png "Rescuetime goal chart for the year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-goals.png "")

I should probably set some reasonable goals for this year and follow-up closely.
This will be something to keep an eye this year. 👀

In general **I saw good improvement** in my rescuetime productivity data. I'm
glad to be checking it now. I will define some reasonable goals for the next
year 🙂.

## Music

The [last.fm](https://last.fm) review this year is not as good as the others
from previous years IMO, but let's take a look at it:

[![Everything I scrobbled in 2020, Divided in blocks, lists, and charts.](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "Songs scrobbled this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "")

Google music was discontinued last year and I'm now using [Youtube
Music](https://music.youtube.com). It's not that good but it's good enough. The
good part is that I now have youtube premium (no more ads!).

I discovered 15% new artists this year. I 'm not very good in discovering new
stuff, I usually listen to the same songs all over again 😅. It was nice to see
that YouTube music exposes some YouTube artists as music there, that's how I
started listening to Smooth Mcgroove when working. I love video game music and
Smooth Mcgroove makes 8bit songs singable. 😃

Other than that, we have the usual **Black label society** and **Pantera** in
the second and third position there. No news here. 🤘

It's interesting too see how tags are equaly distributed in that chart. I don't
know if this is good or bad, or even if it means anything 🤔.

In 2019, I listened to more music between 10:00 and 11:00 but **this year it
changed to 18:00 and 19:00**. I believe it's related to the time I'm always done
with work and need that extra boost.

This time I don't have big outliers (as Thursday was last year). The pattern is
the same between days of the week, which makes much more sense. I have no idea
why I scrobbled so much in January of 2019 but it seems much better distributed
this year.

[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix) also provided data about the
songs I listened to (via Last.fm):

[![My the top songs played provided by Exist.io](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-exist.png "Songs scrobbled this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-exist.png "")

No news here, basically the same as Last.fm already exposed.

## TV Shows

This was a topic that was not receiving much love in 2019 and it's even worse
now. I'm still keeping it because I have some shows to recommend (maybe I will
even create some special page to recommend TV shows in the near future 🤔) and I
also want to write here how my life changed in the past years regarding TV.

I'm not tracking the TV shows I watch anymore and I'm not even watching that
much to be honest. In the first half of 2019, I took some time to watch some TV
shows with my wife, especially the documentary **Babies** on Netflix. It was
greta to see the scientific studies that led to the pediatric recommendations we
have today.

We also watched a little bit of **Vikings**, which I enjoy a lot, but other than
that, there was not much else to add to the list.

Last year, I said I was checking [TV
time](https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/10615776/profile) because they were
starting to add adding movies to the app, but I'm not even watching movies
anymore and didn't track anything.

More than ever, I'm realizing how 2020 was quite different than other years.

## Physical data

In 2017 I had a hard time to come up with the metrics for my Physical
activities and it seems things did not improve in the past two years. Someone
may say I should buy the expensive band X or the super expensive hardware Y,
but please don't. I prefer a simple and inexpensive device that tracks and
sends the data to other places.

Getting back to what I have. Now I can't get that many bars on screen no Miband and
they only provide a monthly summary, not an early one. Google fit is not very
helpful as well:

[![Screenshot from the Miband app showing a bar chart](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps1.jpg "Number of steps according to Miband")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps1.jpg "")
[![Screenshot from the Miband app showing data for a month](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps2.jpg "Number of steps for the month according to Miband")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps2.jpg "")
[![Screenshot from the google fit showing data for a month](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps3.jpg "Number of steps for the month according to Google fit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps3.jpg "")

My savior this time will be [Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix),
because they have monthly averages:

[![A bar chart since June 2018. It shows the average steps by month. The average seems to be around 8000 steps a month](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps-exist.jpg "Average steps by month according to Exist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps-exist.jpg "")

It's just an average, not the full number of steps, but it's good enough. I
don't need the total number of steps by year, as my goal is just to understand
if I'm walking enough, and I don't need a precise number for that.

Google location timeline gave me some yearly numbers about walking and public transportation:

[![A car and two circles showing my activity for 2020. 857 km walking, or 250 hours. 5222 km in transportation, or 200 hours](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity.png "Activity according to Google Maps")](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity.png "")
[![A globe with the text: "1.3 times around the world". I traveled a total distance of 53,479km](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity2.png "Total distance according to Google maps")](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity2.png "")

It's nice to see I walked more than 800km this year. **April was the month I
had more steps** and it was probably because of my vacations in Portugal 🇵🇹.

### Weight

I tracked my weight this year as well, here is the data I have:

[![A chart showing how my weight changed across the year. It had a good downwards curve at the end.](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg "My weight according to Google Fit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg "")
[![Screenshot of the Miband app showing some stats, including my current weight (76.60kg) and BMI (23.6)](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-miband.jpg "My current weight and BMI according to Mifit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-miband.jpg "")

Some data is missing from January to May, but after that, I took the Gym
and diet seriously, so we can clearly see how things start to improve.

When I got back from vacation (October), I was ready for some improvement
again and I lose more weight. The weight doesn't mean much as there are many other
important things to track. In my case, I know it was not just weight, I have
better muscles than last year and feel much better as well.

I don't have that many metrics from the Gym. To be honest, I don't like Gyms
that much, so I try to do only do the really necessary things. I do
measurements from time to time because it's provided by the Gym. I do
everything on paper there, so I don't spend any time with that.

I take pictures of the data and keep it with me. This time I decided to just
quickly put that on a spreadsheet and generate some charts. Here is what I
have since 2018:

[![Many charts showing the difference in measurement. They don't show much, there are too few data points.](/images/stats/2020/yir/gym-logs.png "My manual measurement tracking. Too few data points, unfortunately")](/images/stats/2020/yir/gym-logs.png "")

As you can see, there's not much data and data is missing sometimes for some
reason. **All measurements are done in centimeters** (of course). For the three
initial charts, the less the better. The opposite is true for the charts below
it.

There's not much to correlate between the Gym measurements and the weight
though.

### Sleep

Again, the Miband app is not very useful:

[![Bar chart showing data from November to January. Some more stats about the current month](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep1.jpg "Sleep information according to Mifit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep1.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Mifit app showing the sleep data for the current month. Time of sleep woke up time and avg deep sleep](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep2.jpg "Sleep data for the current month according to Mifit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep2.jpg "")

I sync the same data with Google fit and connect it to
[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix). Those two services provide
some good visualizations of my data:

[![Bar chart by month on the Google Fit app. It shows December as the month with more Sleep. The average seems to be 7 hours and 30 min](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg "Amount of sleep according to Google fit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg "")
[![Bar chart by month on the Exist app](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-exist.jpg "Sleep data according to Exist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-exist.jpg "")

I finished reading [Why We
Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435182291) in July and I was
curious to see how changing my routine influenced my sleep. I was expecting to
have a more immediate impact on August or September, but I can see **I only had
a real impact after September**. :)

I'm also using the [Sleep as
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&hl=en)
app to get some sleep data. I connect it to my Miband and let it track. Here is
the data I was able to extract from the app:

[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing the general stats. Duration of 7 hours, Irregularity of ~1 hour, 36% of deep sleep, 93% of efficiency](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg "General stats according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my chronotype of Morning lark](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg "My chronotype according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg "")

I'm a morning lark. I usually work better in the morning and go to sleep
earlier. The average duration of my sleep is a bit low in this app for some
reason, but it's usually between 7h and 7h30m.

The Efficiency is the time I'm in bed but actually sleeping not browsing the
internet or having problems to sleep. 93% is a good value.

[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my deep sleep time. It seems to have a downward tendency.](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg "My deep work time according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my sleep irregularity. The chart data seems irregular too.](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg "My irregularity of sleep according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg "")

My deep sleep is decreasing in the past months for some reason, I have to
improve this situation. I believe the decrease of deep work is happening
because of my habit of looking at my cellphone before sleeping. I will try to
cut the cellphone at night again.

My irregularity of sleep is also not good, I should have close to no
irregularity of sleep. I hope to improve that until the middle of the year,
after that I can't promise anything. 😉

[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing the wake-up time for working days and free days](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg "Wake up time for working days and free days according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my fall asleep hour. The duration is worse when I sleep later.](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg "Duration of sleep by fall asleep hours according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg "")

It's interesting to see that I usually wake up later and sometimes sleep more
when it's "free days" (holidays and weekend), but most of the time I keep the
same duration. The time I go to sleep is also clearly related to the duration
of the second chart. I believe this is pretty common since I have time to
wake up but not a time to go to sleep. I'm aware of the problem already and I
hope to improve it.

I'm happy with the sleep data I have and I have to say I'm curious about the
data I will have about that next year.

## Words written and errors

This year I didn't have the data to consolidate and I don't want to check every
weekly email to consolidate it. Grammarly will have to do better if they want
their customers to get better data about their writings. Sorry Grammarly,
weekly emails are not enough.

This is the data I have from the last email I received before my vacations in
December:

[![Screenshot of the email sent by Grammarly. It shows the number of words checked (13618)](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly.png "Grammarly data for this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly.png "")
[![Screenshot of the email sent by Grammarly. It shows the number of alerts shown (156),  the number of unique words used (2844), and total words checked (1,478,380)](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly2.png "Grammarly data for this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly2.png "")

We can see that I wrote almost 1.5MM words since I started. I checked the first
time Grammarly sent this number and it was 963,838 words written on Feb 11th.
Let's do a simple math:

```
1478380 - 963838 = 514542   -- words written between Feb and Dec
514542 / 10 = 51424 -- words by month (Feb -> Dec)
```

It seems **I write around 50k words every month**. It would be **around 600k works
a year**. 🙂

I would love to have a chart like [the one I had in
2017](/post/2017-year-in-review/) so I could see what errors I had and so on
but it's not viable, unfortunately. 😕

## Locations

In 2018, I went to **Chile** and the **USA**. In 2020, I went to **Uruguay**,
the **USA**, and **Portugal**.

Here is the summary of the year and all-time data by Google:

[![World map view with pins to the countries I visited](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general.png "")
[![My all-time data. 9 countries visited, 114 cities, and 1048 places.](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general2.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general2.png "")

I have to say that I'm very proud of myself when I see all-time data. I
believe that getting to know other places and cultures is something that
expands your mind in many ways. 🙂

Here are some of the cities and places I visited this year:

[![Pictures of cities I visited. Montevideo, Boulder, and Ponta Delgada](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places.png "Cities visited, by Google locations")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places.png "")
[![Pictures of places I visited. Palace of Monserrate, Campos do Jordão, Cascais, Parque Terra Nostra, Plaza Zabala](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places2.png "Places visited, by Google locations")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places2.png "")

I'm quite satisfied with my trips in 2020.

## Expenses

I have some sad news about my expenses data this year. The app I was using
before is now even worse, so I decided to not use it anymore and remove all my
data from there.

The good news is that I decided to invest more time on investing this year, so
I had to organize my finances somehow. Because of the need for an organization, I
had to get all my investing data into one spreadsheet.

I decided to use
[dlombello's](https://www.dlombelloplanilhas.com/planilhas/controle-de-investimentos)
spreadsheet for that (pt-BR only). I have to say that I'm amazed by how
feature-complete is this spreadsheet. It's still worrisome that you have to
give full access to your Google account for it to work (because of external
scripts), so I created a Google account just for that. Until now, it totally
worth the effort.

Here are some charts I can get from the spreadsheet:

[![Pizza chart for my types of investments](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-type.png "Types of investments by dlombello spreadsheet")](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-type.png "")
[![Pizza chart for my types of investments by index](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-index.png "Types of investments by index via dlombello spreadsheet")](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-index.png "")

The first chart shows the types of investments I have. The Orange and green are
related to the stock market and the rest is bonds and others. The second chart
is the indexes these investments are related to.

I don't think these charts are very good, but I started to use this spreadsheet
last month and I don't have that many ways to retrieve good information from it
yet. I hope to have better data next year, let's see how it goes. 😉

Regarding my savings, it **increased by 23.87%** this year (compared to 26.72%
in 2018 and 16.83% for a bit more than half of 2017), an **average increase of 2.57%** per month.

In 2017, I said I had 75.10% of my savings goal. Well, I met this goal in 2018. 😅

The plan was done long ago and it doesn't make sense anymore given the current
economic conditions. I decided to keep it anyway as it would be good to keep
the history until I meet the goal. When I finally got to the value I wanted, I
started a new plan.

Considering this new plan and the whole year of 2020, **I have 89.40% of my
goal**. I know it's weird to just introduce this value without further
background, but just wanted to keep it here for my future self.

Given the current circumstances and my life choices, this goal will have to
change this year. I'm OK with these changes, it's important to have plans but
it's also important to change them if the circumstances require such change
IMO.

I'm looking forward to seeing what this new year will do to my expenses and
general portfolio 😅.

## Time to write this blog post

Phew... finally finished this one. 😅

This time I could track the whole process and **it took 17h21min to write this
blog post**.

[![The total time and a list of entries with their duration](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-writing-time.png "Total time to write this blog post")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-writing-time.png "")

I can say the same thing I said in 2017: It totally worth my time
to write this. We have so many good insights when reviewing the data we
collected. 😌


## Conclusion

I have nothing to complain about 2018 and 2020. The only thing I should have
done earlier in the year in review for 2018 because it totally changes my mood
about what I did. It's great to do reviews because you can clearly see (at
least it's the case for me) that you did what you wanted to do in the general
context.

It's clear to me that doing my year in review in 2017 helped to improve things
I could only see when looking in "bird's eye view". Some things are not so
noticeable when you're seeing them in context, but they become clear when you
put them in a yearly context.

I'm sure 2020 will be a year full of huge challenges for me, but I'm also
curious to see the data I'm going to collect this year! 😉
