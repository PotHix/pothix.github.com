**Brace yourselves, like any other stats post, this one will be HUGE**

If you're following my blog, you know that I sometimes mentioned things were too
hard and I couldn't sit down and write. Looking back now, I have a good laugh
for my past self. ☺️

I can say for sure that 2020 was a complicated year and **a lot** of things
changeg in my life. The biggest change is that I'm now a father of twins. I
still remember when a colleague mentioned: "I'm curious to see how your metrics
post will be next year". Well, I'm curious too, so let's see.

## Average day

I'd like to start with what an average day is to me according to
[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix) because it feels like a TL;DR
of this post:

[![A list of data showing how a day works. Starts with a sleep of 7 hours and a half, 3 hours and a half of productive time, 11 tracks, 1 tweet, 2 hours of distracting time, almost 9 thousand steps, an average of 4 for my rating and going to sleep at 11h30](/images/stats/2020/yir/exist-average-day.png "My day according to Exist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/exist-average-day.png "")

There's one thing I'm certain about this: I'm not weighting 78.1kg. 😂 I
probably forgot to add my weight to mi-fit this year because the gym is not a
reality anymore.

## Books

[![Year in books from Goodreads. Shows "On the shortness of life" as the shortest book and "Homo Deus" as the longest one. "The power of habit" is the most popular book. I read 6291 pages across 25 books this year](/images/stats/2020/yir/goodreads-year-in-books-logo.png "My year in books by Goodreads")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

I had a much smaller goal this year. Instead of setting ~30 books, I just set 10
because I was sure my year would be totally different than anything I was used
to. There was also the feeling that having goals were influencing my choice of
books to read, so I wanted to try something different.

I'm glad to meet the modest mark of 10 books this year. It was not stressful and
quite easy to reach the goal. I will probably do the same for 2021, if I read
more than that (I don't think it's going to happen), it would be better than
having a bigger goal and not be able to accomplish it.

You can see my 2020 Goodreads challenge
[here](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621-2020-reading-challenge). :)

I used [Google keep](https://keep.google.com) to take notes of all the books I
read until the end of 2020 and I'm now using [Roam
research](https://roamresearch.com) for that. All my notes are being
consolidated there. Every time I finish a book, I review my notes and post them
along with a review on Goodreads and on this blog. The plan is to migrate all my
reviews here so I can own my content again.

If you want to see the reviews I already migrated, check the
[books](/tags/books) out. If you see I didn't migrate all the titles yet, you
can always look for my whole [list of books read in
2020](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2020)
on Goodreads.

Here are some stats provided by Goodreads comparing all the books I
have registered:

[![A list by year with progress bars. The biggest one is from 2017, the second is 2018, and 2020 is the third one most filled](/images/stats/2020/yir/goodreads.png "List of books read by year")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

I can see now that I'm reducing the number of books I'm reading every year, but
I don't think I should be concerned about that. The number should not surpass
the quality of books and how much I'm applying what I learn.

One of my concerns was related to the quality on my reviews. In 2018 I had a lot
of 3 star reviews, so I tried to improve my picks in 2019 and got some
improvements. Let's see how was 2020:

[![The years of 2020, 2019, and 2018 and their book ratings by me](/images/stats/2020/yir/goodreads-details.png "Comparison between 2018, 2019, and 2020")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

Things are much better! For the first time I have more 5 star reviews than 4
stars! 🤩 This is one of the reasons why I love to have metrics, they help me
realize what I've been doing and improve 💪.

As it happened last year, but after writing this section I'm feeling even better
about the number of books I read this year and their quality.

## Articles

The articles section for this year will be quite interesting because I decided
to migrate my articles from Pocket to Todoist. I found I had a lot of things on
Pocket that were worth reading but some others and didn't make sense anymore
(e.g. the macroeconomic news of 2017).

When I used the same old script I used for the previous year, the result was
quite... interesting:

In 2020, I had **484 articles unread and 3091 articles read** compared with 2019
that I had **1908 articles unread and 1731 articles read**, it's quite a
difference.

It doesn't mean that I read 1500 articles this year (Exist says I read 996
articles), but at least I'm sure there were 500+ garbage articles there.

When checking my Todoist project, I can see I have **149 completed tasks there**
and I can trust this value now. ✅

The result of this metric is not very good because I messed up with my numbers.
Let's consider I read 149 articles this year, it's not that bad compared to the
275 I read last year, but the number is decreasing every year. Let's see what is
going to happen in 2021.

## Coding

All my coding metrics are provided by
[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix). When we have a light blue bar inside
a dark blue one, it means the light one is the global average and the dark one
is the top coder. We should usually focus on the **light blue part of the bar**.

First, let's take a look at the total time coding:

[![Coding stats for this year. I logged 313 hours and my best day was March 21](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png "Total time coding this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

My daily average this year is even lower than the 1h31 per day I got in 2017,
which looks really low for me. I'm still above the average, but 47 mins on
average is a bit weird. 😐

I remember the official Wakatime profile [added a comment to my 2017
post](post/2017-year-in-review/) to mention that it may be related to the way
Wakatime records the numbers. I remember tweaking things a bit but I'm not sure
if I should increase the numbers to have unrealistic reports. Maybe I should
try to tweak the data collection once again.

[![Three projects followed by their progress bars](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png "Total time coding by project this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I dedicated only 22 hours to this blog, compared to 80+ hours in 2017. I would
like to improve this, but I'm not sure if it will be a priority, unfortunately.

[Todoist](https://todoist.com) is my top project for this year, which is
expected since it's my main job. I expected to have more time tracked there,
but I'm not only coding for the main Todoist repository, so it makes sense. I
hope to also have [Twist](https://twist.com) as a relevant project on my list
of projects next year, or at least have integrations related to it.

I still keep the same freelance job I have for more than 4 years now. It became
almost a personal project for me. The good part of working for them is that the
work is just coding and mostly fixing bugs. I just need to sit down and write some
code.

This year was totally atypical since I took some time to migrate the framework
and infrastructure of this project. It was a big challenge, especially for
someone working using their spare time for that. I expect the number of hours
working on this project to totally shrink in 2020. Let's see.

[![Total time by OS and editors. The top coder has a very big progress bar while mine is 20% of that](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png "Total time coding by editor and OS this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I'm just using Linux, so it's expected to have it here. I'm using it much more
than the average as we can see. The "top coder" is an outlier for sure. 😜

In 2017, I wrote: _Looks like I fully switched to Emacs_. It seems things have changed again. I'm back to Vim now. 🙂

[![A list of 4 languages along with their progress bars. Dark blue is very long and light blue very small](/images/stats/2020/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png "Total time coding by language this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Markdown is still in this list for the same reasons I had in 2017:

* I still write posts on my blog using Markdown
* I'm responsible for [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com)
  and [Twist](https://developer.twistapp.com) documentation
* I usually write a long post in Emacs/Vim and then paste them to Twist

There's no surprise that **Python** is the language I used the most this year,
since we use Python for almost everything at [Doist](https://doist.com).

I use Ruby at my freelance job, so there's no surprise to still have it there.

In 2017, I mentioned that _I don't think I will have enough ground to play with
Elixir this year but maybe Rust will have his time in my schedule in 2018._ It
was true about Elixir, unfortunately, but I had an improvement for Rust 🦀. I
even [had my first change merged into the
compiler](https://pothix.com/post/contributing-to-rust/)! The change itself was
quite simple, but it was great to understand how to contribute and hopefully,
new contributions will come this year!

## Speaking

After 2017, I had a hangover of speaking. 😅

For those of you who remember, I spoke 24 times in 2017. I decided to create
some sort of a challenge for myself to speak more and was quite successful at
it. After such an achievement, I decided to change my priorities. 😃

To make things easier to track, I now have the [talks page](/talks), which I'm
going to use it as a reference here.

+ **In 2018, I spoke 7 times with 6 different presentations. 6 different
presentations delivered in pt-BR and one of them delivered in English.**
+ **In 2020, I spoke 2 times and both were the same presentation. I spoke at the
local Ruby meetup and brought that same (slightly changed) presentation to
Rubyconf Brasil.**

We can clearly see that I'm slowing down my pace of presentations. I came from
24 presentations in 2017, to 7 in 2018, to 2 in 2020. That's exactly what I
wanted to do. I have to say that I was already feeling bad to not be speaking
for some time and I was eager to speak in 2020. 😅 I don't think things are changing much for 2020 though.

It's also worth mentioning that I was also on stage last year, but not
delivering a talk. I was one of the core organizers of [Rust LATAM](https://2020.rustlatam.org), the first
big conference about Rust in Latin America.  It was a great experience and you
can read more about it [here](/post/how-was-rust-latam-2020/).


## Completed tasks

Every year Todoist releases an astonishing Year in review. Here is mine from
[2017](https://todoist.com/review/2017/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJ1QWNKZHhCQyIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxN30.zJQ9q-v1pyL1HwerqktZyNMLSwC7RxC0CKHUNdkoZQI),
[2018](https://todoist.com/review/2018/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJFaklzQ3BBeiIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOH0.2EMtZYiOkn8QjLUZjfgccy5ZUyfYtV5uGHfGgDSU1lQ),
and now
[2020](https://todoist.com/review/2020/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJmeU1mckJqdSIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOX0.HwRgJULd8lDN6FjCC5tcrMYVegrXQCk_X6D713bV14E),
which is the one we're going to explore.

Let's check my Todoist tasks! 🙂

[![A good design of some colorful balls rolling and the number of completed tasks in 2020](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed.png "Tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed.png "")
[![16 tasks per day, 119 tasks per week, 516 tasks per month](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed2.png "Average of tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed2.png "")

6198 tasks are less than what I expected since **I completed 6323 tasks in 2018**.
It's not a huge problem because it always depends on how you organize your task
manager. In my case, I also have my routine on my task manager so it can help
me to actually do the things I plan for myself. The plan for 2020 is to remove
my routine from Todoist and move it to my calendar, so I can only have the
important tasks there. By removing these tasks from Todoist, I will probably
have a report with fewer tasks next year and that's OK. 🙂

It looks like **Friday is the day I complete more tasks**:

[![Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account. I complete an average of 24 completed tasks every Friday](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png "Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed.png "")

I think it happens because I usually post my snippets every Friday, so I
complete the list of tasks I have to post there every Friday.

**My most productive time is 10:00** (not 16:00 as I had in 2017):

[![A chart with peaks by the hour of the day. A drawing with a text show Sep 23 as the day I completed more tasks. Another drawing with a text saying that I postponed more tasks on Monday](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "Tasks completed by time and postponed by time")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "")

I found it very interesting that the productivity chart correlates with my
[When
tracker](https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf)
(wrote about it on [my current productivity workflow
2020](/post/my-current-productivity-workflow/)):

[![A sheet of paper with something that looks like a chart showing the times I feel more productive. It usually happens in the morning and late in the afternoon](/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png)](/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png "My daily when tracker filled in 2018")

Let's see how those tasks are distributed throughout the year. You can clearly see my vacations on the light gray columns:

[![Many small squares filled in scales of gray regarding the tasks I completed by day on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "Tasks completed by day on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "")

I'm still one of the 1% heavy users of Todoist! 😃

[![Orange background with some spheres. The text says I have 11069 karma points and I'm one of the top 1% users of Todoist](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-top-1.png "Top 1% user of Todoist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/tasks-top-1.png "")

The data and design of our year in review is awesome. I did not participate in
the project this year (as I did in 2017), but proud of what we can
deliver. 🎉

## Podcasts

[![Print screen of an Android phone showing a set of stats from the Podcast Addict app.](/images/stats/2020/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "Time listening to Podcasts this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "")
[![Print screen of an Android phone showing a list of podcasts and the time listening to each. Nerdcast is the first with 5 days and 16 hours](/images/stats/2020/yir/podcasts-list.jpg "Time listening by Podcasts")](/images/stats/2020/yir/podcasts-list.jpg "")

Unfortunately, I don't have data about 2018 anymore, so I will just mention
2020 here.

If I was listening to the episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn't) it would
be equivalent to **18 days and 4 hours** of non-stop listening. As I usually
listen to Podcast in 2x or more (depending on many factors), I would say I
spent around 9 days listening to Podcasts, which is **effectively around 216
hours of my time**.

I usually listen to podcasts when I'm commuting, walking the dog, washing the
dishes, doing exercises, etc. I'm usually focusing on
[audiobooks](https://pothix.com/post/audiobooks/), but I listen to podcasts
between one book and another.

The list of podcasts shown here is actually my global list, not the yearly
one, unfortunately. I'm not even listening to new episodes of some of these
anymore, but they are still there.

## Hours working, focusing and distractions

Let's start checking all my data tracked using [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![A bar chart for the year 2020 and 2018. Blue bars for 2020 and gray for 2018. They look similar in general but with changes in different months.](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time-comparison.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

The **gray bars are related to the data for 2018**. I believe the changes are
related to my scheduled vacations. :)

Let's check my time working, considering my full-time job only:

[![Bar chart for the year of 2020. The average seems to be around 150 hours. There's a list of categories at the bottom showing, deep work, meeting, and shallow work](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time-fulltime-job.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

April was conference + retreat + vacations for me, so it's an outlier.
Considering 40 days of vacations during the year (we don't have national
holidays, they are included in the 40 days) and dividing the average of 151
hours a month by 18 (21 working days - 3 days of vacations per month) **I have an
average of 8 hours and a half of work every day**. At [Doist](https://doist.com),
we recommend to not work more than 8 hours a day, so I'm working a bit more but
it's under control.

**I spent 81 hours of my year in meetings**. Most of them were weekly sync
meetings with my remote team and also a monthly 1-on-1 with the head of my
team. I consider all of those meetings productive. There was **not a single
meeting last year where I found myself wasting my time**, so these 81 hours are
actually fine.

The most interesting part for me is the Shallow x Deep work ratio. **I have
almost 3 times less time Deep working than Shallow working**, which is not that
good. This is totally something I have to improve in 2020.

To give a bit more context, **I consider Deep work any work I can do without
distraction**. Shallow work is the work I do while I have other tabs opened on
my browser or while I'm doing something else on the side.

I think I'm not tracking that as I should. Sometimes I'm focused on reading
Twist and answering questions, but as it's not coding, I consider it as shallow
work. I will certainly improve it for 2020. 🤞

As I mentioned in my previous review, I keep one freelance job, which is almost
a personal project for me. I like to improve the app and make it better. I don't
have freelance gigs, but this one I'm happy to keep. Here is the time I tracked
about it this year (based on Toggl, not totally accurate):

[![Bar chart. The average seems to be about 15 hours but there's a big outlier in Ju, with almost 70 hours.](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-freelance.png "Chart for time working in my freelance job")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-freelance.png "")

June is an outlier as I did the migration of the application to a different
infrastructure in one weekend. It was an exception as I don't work during
weekends most of the time. As it was my idea to do this migration, it was
personal to me. This migration project was the topic of my two presentations
this year, as I knew it would be an interesting topic to talk about.

Other than that, I usually don't work more than 20 hours a month for them. I
reserve some time every weekday to work on different things. This project is
usually the first in the list, but sometimes I just don't want to work on it
and decide to use my time for other things (tech-related or not).

What I wrote on my 2017 Year in review still holds:

```
I really like my full-time job (more than ever!) but I like to do different
projects without constraints, it can be this freelance job or other activities
that also brings me joy.
```

I have a metric for the **time I spent doing/planning my talks** this year:

[![Bar chart with only two charts, one in Jun and the other in Nov. Jun seems to be 4 times bigger.](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-presentation.png "Chart for my time doing/planning presentations")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-presentation.png "")

June was a busy month, just because I decided it would be. :) I want to keep
track of presentations, writing on my blog, etc. because I can easily metric
how much I'm donating to the community. Sometimes, instead of working for my
freelance, I decided to write and publish something that may be useful to
someone else. Sometimes I decide to create slides for my next presentation at a
local meetup. If I take the ~10 hours, I can easily measure how much I'm
donating to the community by applying my freelancing hour rate.  It may be
useless for other people, but it's highly valuable for me.

I don't want any money in exchange, but it's important for people to know that
others are donating their time because they like to do it and because they
believe it may be useful for someone else. I've been participating/organizing
communities for more than 10 years now and I know how easy it is for people to
take local meetups for granted as it is free and someone else is taken care of
it.

Moving along with the metrics, let's check what data
[rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) can provide regarding my
productivity. :)

Let's look at the productive and distracting hours for the entire year:

[![An infographic with information for every month of 2020 in small bars and text about productivity. 2208 total hours logged, 1134 productive hours, and 525 distracting hours. My productivity pulse is 54](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-2020.png "Rescuetime year in review metrics for 2020")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-2020.png "")

The metrics of 2018 were not posted last here but here are them for comparison:

[![An infographic with information for every month of 2018 in small bars and text about productivity. 2333 total hours logged, 1058 productive hours, and 769 distracting hours. My productivity pulse is 54](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-2018.png "Rescuetime year in review metrics for 2018")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-2018.png "")

This is part of the [year in
review](https://www.rescuetime.com/year-in-review/2020) provided by rescuetime.
They also provide a chart with the categories I used the most:

[![A strange-looking chart in a circular format. The lines above go towards the border showing which category I used the most. Communication & scheduling is the most used.](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "Most used categories according to rescuetime")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "")

The dashboard shows similar information but with some other things:

[![The rescuetime dashboard showing metrics for the entire year. The productivity pulse is 55](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png "Rescuetime dashboard data for 2020")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png "")
[![A chart showing my goal for this year. It was 900 hours and 30 mins in total and 783 all productive time](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-goals.png "Rescuetime goal chart for the year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/rescuetime-goals.png "")

**I had a lot more productive hours than I had in 2017 or 2018** and this is a
good thing. 🙂

## Music

Again, [last.fm](https://last.fm) did a great year in review for me, so let's
check some stats here.

[![A chart of songs scrobbled by month. In total was 5501 scrobles.](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "Songs scrobbled this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "")
[![6 different charts with the data. Listening time, top tags, listening week, artists, albums, and tracks](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png "Listening stats for this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png "")
[![Listening percentiles compared to the user base](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png "Listening percentiles compared to the user base")](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png "")
[![Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-discovery.png "Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-discovery.png "")

I'm using [Google Music](https://music.google.com) for two years now, so I was
already expecting to not have 500%+ on my Discovery as I had in 2017. My
Discovery this time is mostly related to Pops Staples, which is awesome BTW.

As usual, I'm listening to a **lot of Heavy and Thrash metal, along with a lot
of Soundtracks, which is mostly Howard Shore** (no news here).

In 2017, I listened to more music between 20:00 nad 21:00 and how it changed
between 10:00 and 11:00. I believe it's because I changed, even more, my routine
to be even more a morning person. I usually use music to focus or to create the
mood for the day, so it would make sense.

I have no idea why Thursday is the big outlier this year. Maybe because I'm
afraid about the end of the week and I'm using music to concentrate to deliver
everything I postponed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday? LOL

[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix) also provided data about the
songs I listened to (via Last.fm):

[![My the top songs played was Low Down by Black Label Society, Humanity by Scorpions, Unreal by Soil, Nothing Else Matters by Metallica and Black 7 by Soil](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-exist.png "Songs scrobbled this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/lastfm-exist.png "")

This is the piece of information I was missing from Last.fm, so it's nice to
see it here 😃.

## TV Shows

I had a topic for TV shows in 2017 and I'm just realizing how this is not a
priority for me anymore. I'm not tracking the TV shows and I watch and I'm not
even watching that much anymore.

There are some TV shows that I watched and enjoyed though: **Game of Thrones**
(it's not about the end, but the journey) and **Vikings**. **Westworld Season
2** was OK. There's also **Altered Carbon** I watched in 2018 that I enjoyed,
the concept is great.

To be honest, I don't even remember the ones I watched. I tried to use
[Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) but they don't provide your data if you're not
paying, so... whatever. I checked [TV
time](https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/10615776/profile) and it seems they are
adding movies to the app, so maybe I will start using it again since the app
is great.

## Physical data

In 2017 I had a hard time to come up with the metrics for my Physical
activities and it seems things did not improve in the past two years. Someone
may say I should buy the expensive band X or the super expensive hardware Y,
but please don't. I prefer a simple and inexpensive device that tracks and
sends the data to other places.

Getting back to what I have. Now I can't get that many bars on screen no Miband and
they only provide a monthly summary, not an early one. Google fit is not very
helpful as well:

[![Screenshot from the Miband app showing a bar chart](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps1.jpg "Number of steps according to Miband")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps1.jpg "")
[![Screenshot from the Miband app showing data for a month](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps2.jpg "Number of steps for the month according to Miband")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps2.jpg "")
[![Screenshot from the google fit showing data for a month](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps3.jpg "Number of steps for the month according to Google fit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps3.jpg "")

My savior this time will be [Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix),
because they have monthly averages:

[![A bar chart since June 2018. It shows the average steps by month. The average seems to be around 8000 steps a month](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps-exist.jpg "Average steps by month according to Exist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/steps-exist.jpg "")

It's just an average, not the full number of steps, but it's good enough. I
don't need the total number of steps by year, as my goal is just to understand
if I'm walking enough, and I don't need a precise number for that.

Google location timeline gave me some yearly numbers about walking and public transportation:

[![A car and two circles showing my activity for 2020. 857 km walking, or 250 hours. 5222 km in transportation, or 200 hours](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity.png "Activity according to Google Maps")](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity.png "")
[![A globe with the text: "1.3 times around the world". I traveled a total distance of 53,479km](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity2.png "Total distance according to Google maps")](/images/stats/2020/yir/maps-activity2.png "")

It's nice to see I walked more than 800km this year. **April was the month I
had more steps** and it was probably because of my vacations in Portugal 🇵🇹.

### Weight

I tracked my weight this year as well, here is the data I have:

[![A chart showing how my weight changed across the year. It had a good downwards curve at the end.](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg "My weight according to Google Fit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg "")
[![Screenshot of the Miband app showing some stats, including my current weight (76.60kg) and BMI (23.6)](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-miband.jpg "My current weight and BMI according to Mifit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/weight-miband.jpg "")

Some data is missing from January to May, but after that, I took the Gym
and diet seriously, so we can clearly see how things start to improve.

When I got back from vacation (October), I was ready for some improvement
again and I lose more weight. The weight doesn't mean much as there are many other
important things to track. In my case, I know it was not just weight, I have
better muscles than last year and feel much better as well.

I don't have that many metrics from the Gym. To be honest, I don't like Gyms
that much, so I try to do only do the really necessary things. I do
measurements from time to time because it's provided by the Gym. I do
everything on paper there, so I don't spend any time with that.

I take pictures of the data and keep it with me. This time I decided to just
quickly put that on a spreadsheet and generate some charts. Here is what I
have since 2018:

[![Many charts showing the difference in measurement. They don't show much, there are too few data points.](/images/stats/2020/yir/gym-logs.png "My manual measurement tracking. Too few data points, unfortunately")](/images/stats/2020/yir/gym-logs.png "")

As you can see, there's not much data and data is missing sometimes for some
reason. **All measurements are done in centimeters** (of course). For the three
initial charts, the less the better. The opposite is true for the charts below
it.

There's not much to correlate between the Gym measurements and the weight
though.

### Sleep

Again, the Miband app is not very useful:

[![Bar chart showing data from November to January. Some more stats about the current month](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep1.jpg "Sleep information according to Mifit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep1.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Mifit app showing the sleep data for the current month. Time of sleep woke up time and avg deep sleep](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep2.jpg "Sleep data for the current month according to Mifit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep2.jpg "")

I sync the same data with Google fit and connect it to
[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix). Those two services provide
some good visualizations of my data:

[![Bar chart by month on the Google Fit app. It shows December as the month with more Sleep. The average seems to be 7 hours and 30 min](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg "Amount of sleep according to Google fit")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg "")
[![Bar chart by month on the Exist app](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-exist.jpg "Sleep data according to Exist")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-exist.jpg "")

I finished reading [Why We
Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435182291) in July and I was
curious to see how changing my routine influenced my sleep. I was expecting to
have a more immediate impact on August or September, but I can see **I only had
a real impact after September**. :)

I'm also using the [Sleep as
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&hl=en)
app to get some sleep data. I connect it to my Miband and let it track. Here is
the data I was able to extract from the app:

[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing the general stats. Duration of 7 hours, Irregularity of ~1 hour, 36% of deep sleep, 93% of efficiency](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg "General stats according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my chronotype of Morning lark](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg "My chronotype according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg "")

I'm a morning lark. I usually work better in the morning and go to sleep
earlier. The average duration of my sleep is a bit low in this app for some
reason, but it's usually between 7h and 7h30m.

The Efficiency is the time I'm in bed but actually sleeping not browsing the
internet or having problems to sleep. 93% is a good value.

[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my deep sleep time. It seems to have a downward tendency.](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg "My deep work time according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my sleep irregularity. The chart data seems irregular too.](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg "My irregularity of sleep according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg "")

My deep sleep is decreasing in the past months for some reason, I have to
improve this situation. I believe the decrease of deep work is happening
because of my habit of looking at my cellphone before sleeping. I will try to
cut the cellphone at night again.

My irregularity of sleep is also not good, I should have close to no
irregularity of sleep. I hope to improve that until the middle of the year,
after that I can't promise anything. 😉

[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing the wake-up time for working days and free days](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg "Wake up time for working days and free days according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg "")
[![A screenshot of the Sleep as Android app showing my fall asleep hour. The duration is worse when I sleep later.](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg "Duration of sleep by fall asleep hours according to Sleep as Android")](/images/stats/2020/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg "")

It's interesting to see that I usually wake up later and sometimes sleep more
when it's "free days" (holidays and weekend), but most of the time I keep the
same duration. The time I go to sleep is also clearly related to the duration
of the second chart. I believe this is pretty common since I have time to
wake up but not a time to go to sleep. I'm aware of the problem already and I
hope to improve it.

I'm happy with the sleep data I have and I have to say I'm curious about the
data I will have about that next year.

## Words written and errors

This year I didn't have the data to consolidate and I don't want to check every
weekly email to consolidate it. Grammarly will have to do better if they want
their customers to get better data about their writings. Sorry Grammarly,
weekly emails are not enough.

This is the data I have from the last email I received before my vacations in
December:

[![Screenshot of the email sent by Grammarly. It shows the number of words checked (13618)](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly.png "Grammarly data for this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly.png "")
[![Screenshot of the email sent by Grammarly. It shows the number of alerts shown (156),  the number of unique words used (2844), and total words checked (1,478,380)](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly2.png "Grammarly data for this year")](/images/stats/2020/yir/grammarly2.png "")

We can see that I wrote almost 1.5MM words since I started. I checked the first
time Grammarly sent this number and it was 963,838 words written on Feb 11th.
Let's do a simple math:

```
1478380 - 963838 = 514542   -- words written between Feb and Dec
514542 / 10 = 51424 -- words by month (Feb -> Dec)
```

It seems **I write around 50k words every month**. It would be **around 600k works
a year**. 🙂

I would love to have a chart like [the one I had in
2017](/post/2017-year-in-review/) so I could see what errors I had and so on
but it's not viable, unfortunately. 😕

## Locations

In 2018, I went to **Chile** and the **USA**. In 2020, I went to **Uruguay**,
the **USA**, and **Portugal**.

Here is the summary of the year and all-time data by Google:

[![World map view with pins to the countries I visited](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general.png "")
[![My all-time data. 9 countries visited, 114 cities, and 1048 places.](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general2.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-general2.png "")

I have to say that I'm very proud of myself when I see all-time data. I
believe that getting to know other places and cultures is something that
expands your mind in many ways. 🙂

Here are some of the cities and places I visited this year:

[![Pictures of cities I visited. Montevideo, Boulder, and Ponta Delgada](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places.png "Cities visited, by Google locations")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places.png "")
[![Pictures of places I visited. Palace of Monserrate, Campos do Jordão, Cascais, Parque Terra Nostra, Plaza Zabala](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places2.png "Places visited, by Google locations")](/images/stats/2020/yir/location-places2.png "")

I'm quite satisfied with my trips in 2020.

## Expenses

I have some sad news about my expenses data this year. The app I was using
before is now even worse, so I decided to not use it anymore and remove all my
data from there.

The good news is that I decided to invest more time on investing this year, so
I had to organize my finances somehow. Because of the need for an organization, I
had to get all my investing data into one spreadsheet.

I decided to use
[dlombello's](https://www.dlombelloplanilhas.com/planilhas/controle-de-investimentos)
spreadsheet for that (pt-BR only). I have to say that I'm amazed by how
feature-complete is this spreadsheet. It's still worrisome that you have to
give full access to your Google account for it to work (because of external
scripts), so I created a Google account just for that. Until now, it totally
worth the effort.

Here are some charts I can get from the spreadsheet:

[![Pizza chart for my types of investments](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-type.png "Types of investments by dlombello spreadsheet")](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-type.png "")
[![Pizza chart for my types of investments by index](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-index.png "Types of investments by index via dlombello spreadsheet")](/images/stats/2020/yir/invest-by-index.png "")

The first chart shows the types of investments I have. The Orange and green are
related to the stock market and the rest is bonds and others. The second chart
is the indexes these investments are related to.

I don't think these charts are very good, but I started to use this spreadsheet
last month and I don't have that many ways to retrieve good information from it
yet. I hope to have better data next year, let's see how it goes. 😉

Regarding my savings, it **increased by 23.87%** this year (compared to 26.72%
in 2018 and 16.83% for a bit more than half of 2017), an **average increase of 2.57%** per month.

In 2017, I said I had 75.10% of my savings goal. Well, I met this goal in 2018. 😅

The plan was done long ago and it doesn't make sense anymore given the current
economic conditions. I decided to keep it anyway as it would be good to keep
the history until I meet the goal. When I finally got to the value I wanted, I
started a new plan.

Considering this new plan and the whole year of 2020, **I have 89.40% of my
goal**. I know it's weird to just introduce this value without further
background, but just wanted to keep it here for my future self.

Given the current circumstances and my life choices, this goal will have to
change this year. I'm OK with these changes, it's important to have plans but
it's also important to change them if the circumstances require such change
IMO.

I'm looking forward to seeing what this new year will do to my expenses and
general portfolio 😅.

## Time to write this blog post

Phew... finally finished this one. 😅

This time I could track the whole process and **it took 17h21min to write this
blog post**.

[![The total time and a list of entries with their duration](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-writing-time.png "Total time to write this blog post")](/images/stats/2020/yir/toggl-writing-time.png "")

I can say the same thing I said in 2017: It totally worth my time
to write this. We have so many good insights when reviewing the data we
collected. 😌


## Conclusion

I have nothing to complain about 2018 and 2020. The only thing I should have
done earlier in the year in review for 2018 because it totally changes my mood
about what I did. It's great to do reviews because you can clearly see (at
least it's the case for me) that you did what you wanted to do in the general
context.

It's clear to me that doing my year in review in 2017 helped to improve things
I could only see when looking in "bird's eye view". Some things are not so
noticeable when you're seeing them in context, but they become clear when you
put them in a yearly context.

I'm sure 2020 will be a year full of huge challenges for me, but I'm also
curious to see the data I'm going to collect this year! 😉
