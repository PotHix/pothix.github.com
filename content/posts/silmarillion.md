Book: [The Silmarilion](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1434543586) by J.R.R.
Tolkien. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This is J.R.R. Tolkien's life work. The other known books a product of this. He
was not able to finish this masterpiece, but Christopher Tolkien finished his
father's work in a great way.

I'm not going to lie, the Silmarilion is not an easy to read book. I would not
recommend it to anyone who was not totally aware of the other books and still
looking for more middle earth content. If you already read the other books and
still want to know more about middle-earth, this book is a delight.

The attention to the details and the amount of backstories created for every
character or entity is just amazing. It's great to see the big amount of
references coming from Catholicism, Nordic stories, Greek goods (in a way), and
Tolkien's imagination.

If you're planning to read The Children of Húrin, do it first and skip the same
story from the Silmarilion. They are the same, but it's complete in its own book
(I totally recommend the story BTW).

In summary, if you like Tolkien and the Middle earth, the Silmarilion is a must
read to fully comprehend the background story.
