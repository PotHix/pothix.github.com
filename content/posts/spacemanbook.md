Book: [Spaceman: An Astronaut's Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28439264) by Mike Massimino. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Great book, 4.5 stars.

Mike does a great job describing how is the life of an astronaut. Listen (yes, I used an Audible audiobook) to his story was like living it with him. I could feel how was to be waiting for the NASA phone call after so many years trying to be an astronaut.

Being an astronaut is being part of a family. This is one of the main messages in the book and you can feel it. Today, working for companies, it's hard to get something like this.

A great sentence of the book:

> You just have one life, you must do something that matter

It makes a lot of sense for someone who works for NASA and it should make a lot of sense for all of us too.

I remember telling my mom I would like to be an astronaut when I was a child, but it was just a dream at the time. Mike decided to go for it and became the man responsible for fixing the Hubble telescope. That's pretty amazing. It was not easy (far from it) but he did it. There are many variables to consider, but it was really great to read it.
