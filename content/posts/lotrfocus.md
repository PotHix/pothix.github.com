I'm co-authoring a book about Rust and was reviewing an example about `enum`s.
My plan was to use some sort of reference to J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy world
(because I really like it). I was considering using something like this:

```rust
enum Race {
   Elf,
   Dwarf,
   Men,
   Hobbit,
   Ent
}
```

_PS: I'm only considering the free-peoples of middle earth for this enum._

While thinking about it, a lot of things came to my mind and before I realized,
I was watching a video on YouTube on why Elrond did not kill Isildur on Mount
Doom after he refused destroying the one ring.

The main point here is: I was writing a book about Rust and out of nowhere I
found myself watching a video on YouTube about one of my hobbies.

This is one of the reasons why I believe Deep Work is so important. When deep
working, I convince myself I'm in a diffeent stage and I just say to myself:
"Yes, OK. I will add a task to Todoist to check that when the session starts".
