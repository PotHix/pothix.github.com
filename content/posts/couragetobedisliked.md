Book: [The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change your Life and Achieve Real Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206) by Ichiro Kishimi. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

This is a great book. I have to say that the dialogues are not that good for the audiobook, sometimes you feel they are just too robotic, but other than that, I liked it.

I love these kinds of dialogues where both sides know how to win something. Currently, there are not many good dialogues on our society, especially with the advent of social media (üôÑ), but I would not go into detail here.

The whole idea of Adlerian psychology is very interesting. In some parts, it reminds me of what stoicism says, especially the parts of the "here and now".

It's been a while since I was finding excuses to go out for a walk just to listen to the audiobook. :)
