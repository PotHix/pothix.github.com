Book: [On the Shortness of Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97412) by Seneca. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

A short and good book. After reading [Letters from a Stoic](/letterfromastoic), I got the recommendation of this book as well and it was worth listening to it. This book makes me think about the way I'm living my life and how I'm using my time (not focusing enough?).

If you want a quick and meaningful book, pick this one. :)

Here are my raw notes about the book:

- Life is short but it's long enough to do great things if it's well-invested
- For how many the throne of clients leave them no freedom
- Everyone is wasted for the sake of others
- No one wants to distribute their money but so many are fine with distributing their time
- How many robbed you of life when you were not aware of what you were losing?
- Who can be above him, which is above fortune?
- It takes a whole life to learn how to live
- No one pursuit can be followed by a man who is busy with many things
- No one sets a value on time but they would give anything they have to receive more time in case of illness or capital punishment
- If you need to be told when to eat, you're not totally free ‚Äî üí≠ I'm thinking about that since I have my own eating routine. There are specific times for everything. It doesn't matter if I'm hungry or not, I will crave food. Am I free? (Rhetoric question to myself)
- If you see someone using office clothes, don't envy them as they spent a big portion of their lives invested to be there. ‚Äî üí≠ it's a bit out of context as I think it's probably related to politics (e.g. you have to be old to be a senator), but I think it's valid to some extent today
