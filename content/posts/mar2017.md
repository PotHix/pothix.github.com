Back to work this month. :)

After one month vacation, I got back to my routine and got some good results this month.

### Books

Added three more books to the list:

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

I have to note here that
[Mastery](http://amzn.to/2rdNYFy) [is one of the best books I ever read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1642811841).
Both [Mindfulness in plain English](http://amzn.to/2s60AzW)
and [The Urban Monk](http://amzn.to/2so5lYE) are about meditation and
how to live a minimalist life.

### Articles

I'm still trying to find a way to track the articles I read. In the past months I've being adding all of them to Pocket and reading there. Unfortunately I could not find anything to build information from my pocket reading data (suggestions welcome).

For now I'm just [exporting my content in HTML format](https://getpocket.com/export) and using a simple Javascript to count it:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}

760
570
```

It means I have **760 articles Unread** and **570 articles
Read**. Let's see how it will be next month. ;)

### Coding

I've changed the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix) since the last post. Let's check the new ones:

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

There is no colors or day numbers anymore but it looks better to
understand how many hours I've been working through the month. It's still less than what I was expecting, but that's the main idea, time to improve!

Ruby and Go are the most used languages for this month:

Markdown is just my posts here. LOL

I'm shifting from Vim to Emacs, but I still use Vim a lot:

### Speaking

Presentations for this month:

+ Tech-talk at [Locaweb](https://locaweb.com.br). It was a Tech-talk about [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org). Every time I go to a conference I schedule a talk to explore the content I saw there. I consider that a good practice with my coworkers.
+ [Gaveteiro](https://www.gaveteiro.com.br) it was the same presentation that inspired [my book](https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br) but with a small audience. It took **1h 52min** and was pretty cool (at least for me). :)

### Podcasts

Back to Podcasts again! This time I decided to try a different Podcast
player after many years using
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en). I bought [Pocketcasts](https://play.pocketcasts.com/) and I used it for the whole month.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/podcasts.png "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/mar/podcasts.png)

Don't worry about the _"Since 29th of January"_ because I did not used
any podcast player in February. ;)

I really don't know what these numbers mean. But 1 day of podcast
listening make sense for me. I usually listen podcasts 3x faster, this
is what causes the confusion. :P

I will probably get back to Podcast Addict in April, because it's
superior in many features. Maybe I will write about it soon.

### Hours working

My time tracking with [Toggl](https://toggl.com) is more mature now.

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/mar/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/mar/toggl-time-working.png "")

Besides the **206h30min** I have **6h30min** working on my personal
projects.

[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) says I reached my goal for the month:

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/mar/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

That's great. :)

### Physical activity

Back to the old rhythm, around **10k steps**:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **11.5km** walking:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-distance.png "")

My weight is not there yet, but I'm still tracking:

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/mar/physical-activity-weight.png "")

I slept more this month but with less deep sleeping:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/mar/sleep.jpg "")

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 29 episodes this month.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/mar/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/mar/tvshows.jpg "")

It's probably a combination
of [Vikings](https://www.tvshowtime.com/en/show/260449), [Luke Cage](https://www.tvshowtime.com/pt_BR/show/304219)
and [Iron Fist](https://www.tvshowtime.com/en/show/317953).

### Locations

This month was not so exciting like the last one, but I worked on
my [Google Timeline](https://www.google.com.br/maps/timeline) data to
make it more accurate. Some cities were removed but I have identified
more places I visited:

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/mar/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/mar/location-general.png "")


### Expenses

Phew... finally my expenses are getting back to normal, no more _travel_ taking 50%+ of it. But it's still taking 25%+. :P

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/mar/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/mar/expenses.jpg "")

This chart of expenses **represent 46% of net income**, the rest is being invested.

### Conclusion

It's good to be back and see my productivity data growing. I still
want to improve my expenses because it's not as I expect it to
be. Maybe next month. :)
