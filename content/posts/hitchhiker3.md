Book: [Life, the Universe and Everything (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #3)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8694) by Douglas Adams. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Nothing special about this one... The first one is brilliant, the second one is great, the third is just OK.

This book made me think about reading the fourth and fifth and I think I will stop here. All that moments that make you think about "Life, Universe and Everything" are not present here like was in the first books.
