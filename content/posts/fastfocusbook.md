It's a good book overall. I was between 4 and 5 for this one.
It shares some great insights with [b:When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing|35412097|When The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing|Daniel H.

This book is short and full of great advices. Here are my notes:

* Voluntary attention: when you're reading a book in the same room as your family is watching TV. It's like a muscle and can be trained.
* Involuntary attention is when you see a notification on your phone that removes you from your focus.
* Broader attention is when you check things in a bird's eye view. It provides a big picture of the situation
* Focus attention is when you focus on a particular problem.
* You use the broader attention to find what to focus and use focus attention to work on that particular issue
* Both broad and focus attention are under your control
* Lack of focus can be caused by lack of interest, negative emotions (stressed, annoyed, depressed, etc.), poor organization (how you plan your day), low energy levels (good food, enough sleep, regular exercise), lack of control. -- remote working is excellent to help with this
* Mind wandering is not always bad; you have to make it work for you. Mind wandering helps your creativity
* Focus when you have to focus. When you're in the gym or showering, let your brain wander, and you may be surprised with the results
* Mental fatigue is one of the factors that make it hard to Focus. Get sufficient sleep!
* Stress erodes your attention
* A cluttered mind is an unfocused mind. Our brains often come up with ideas to feel our mind.
* Unresolved problems are bad for your focus (relationship, money problems, etc.)
* Lack of a plan is bad for focus (remember the last time you went to the groceries store without a shipping list? No focus at all)
* Your phone and social media are obviously bad for your focus. They are always fighting for your attention
* When you have a good focus, you spend a better time with your loved ones, focusing on them.
* Which kinds of sounds disrupt your concentration? Maybe conversation is bad but classical music is not
* Look for the smells that improve focus
* Answer to the 15 points of focus to see my score
* Separate a zone for work and another for play. Cellphone, tablet and other devices should not be part of the work zone.
* According to scientists, a disorganized desk interferes on focus. Try to keep your desk as empty as possible
* List the items you need to complete a task and keep them in reach. All other items should go to a box aside. You can organize it later.
* Keep items you use every day in the first drawer and the ones you don't use much in the bottom drawer (invoices, etc.)
* Limit the number of tasks to 5. A lot of tasks will erode your attention and makes you feel stressed. It's better to look for more tasks than postpone
* Check your email only twice a day
Sardonic effect. uncompleted tasks take more attention than the completed ones
* Know your why. It will help you focus and do a better work
* Take short breaks and stretch or walk outside. Power naps are also powerful. These breaks actually increase your productivity instead of decreasing it because you tend to be more focused
* Schedule time chunks so you can focus on the same kind of tasks for a period. Don't forget the breaks
* Avoid scheduling meeting. If you have to schedule them, propose a stand-up meeting or a meeting with no food to make is uncomfortable. Meetings should be short and productive
* Control your productivity. Talk to people who usually offend it and let them know about it and make them feel special. If someone comes to talk to you on your most productive time, then he/she that you can't talk now because you're concentrated to finish a task, but you will be available at X so you both can talk
* Track your energy levels during the day for two weeks. Review your data and plan your days accordingly
* Avoid your email
* Try quick meditation to regain focus
* Don't take more than 400mg of caffeine a day
