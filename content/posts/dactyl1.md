After build the [Iris keyboard](/iris) I decided to start a new quest to build
a Dactyl-cc (as I mentioned at the end of the Iris post ðŸ˜‰)

Dactyl is the keyboad I wanted to build from the start but I certainly didn't
have the skils to do it. I decided to first build a "portable kinesis", so I
could take it with me when I was traveling and Iris seemed like a great fit for
this and not that hard for a first project. Now that I have the skills, I will
build the Dactyl to maybe take my kinesis' place.

This is the first post of [a series about building a dactyl
keyboard](/series/dactyl) and we will focus on the parts I had to buy.

## Where to buy

I decided to buy everything from AliExpress. It's usually cheaper than buying
everything where I like (Brazil) and I not in a hurry, which is the bigger
disadvantage of AliExpress.

Many of these parts I could easily find in a local store, sometimes even
cheaper, but due to the pandemic I don't want to visit any physical store.

With that said, let's go for the list of parts I bought and the individual
links (the advantage of buying everything on AliExpress ðŸ˜„):

## Required parts

It required a lot of reserach to understand what each of these do and why they
are required, but here are my choices:

\* I bought so many things and bundled them together that it's now hard to find
the exact amount of money I spent considering taxes, currencies, bundled
orders, etc. To simplify things a bit I used the average currency exchange from
my credit card bill to get all the BRL prices for these items.

\*\* This item is open for dispute. For some reason the shipment was cancelled
so I'm checking with the seller and didn't get a response.

## Cost and ETA

Currently, it's a total of **$92.50** or R$568,35 approximately. I would say **R$600**
would be a good guess because of the currency exchange flutuation. As a
comparison, the minimum wage in Brazil is R$ 1045.

The average time to get something from AliExpress to Brazil is around 3 weeks
and some of these parts started to arrive already ðŸ˜ƒ

Wait for more about this soon ðŸš€
