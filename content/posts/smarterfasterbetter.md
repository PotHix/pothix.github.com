Book: [Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733966) by Charles Duhigg. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It is a good book. I almost gave 3 stars, but it is still a Mastery effect. It deserves four.

Each chapter in the book is devoted to a specific area: Motivation, Teams, Focus, Goal setting, Managing others, Decision making, Innovation, and Absorbing data.

My notes on each topic:

## Motivation

- Motivation is feeling in control.
- There is an example of the marines training. The training is not exactly about combat, but about doing what you think you couldn't do.

## Teams

- He explains the results of project Aristotle from Google. You don't need stars on your team, you must have a team that cares for each other, where all opinions matter. Read more about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety

## Focus

- Focused teams solve emergencies better.
- Develop mental models
- Anticipate what may happen. What will your wife say at some situation? What will happen if a specific piece fail? Build mental models for many situations as possible

## Goal setting

- Be careful with to-do lists, you have to use them in the right way. You may waste a lot of time just to "reach your goal" and have a clean list. Things like reading emails is not a good goal. Plan for smart goals.

## Managing others

- This chapter is all about Lean and the Toyota way. Learn to listen to your employees and give them enough space to improve the whole process.

## Decision making

- No one can prevent the future, but with enough data, we can forecast some events and even improve the chances of success.

## Innovation

- Innovation is usually a combination of previously known ideas mixed up in a new way.
- The most innovative ideas came from people who deal with multiple groups or departments. People who can explain a concept to other departments easily.
- Toyota gives space for every employee to innovate and improve the process. Disney gives the chance to their employees to put their emotions into the movies.

## Absorbing data

- Collect data and try some hypothesis on it. Every choice is an experiment.
- When we learn something, we should force ourselves to interact with the data. Try to explain a new concept to a friend for example.
