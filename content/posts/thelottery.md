Book: [The Lottery](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4061861214) by Shirley Jackson. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

I decided to read The Lottery after reading [The Waste Lands (The Dark Tower,
#3](/darktower3). They mention the book because of a situation happening in Lud,
and they call it "Shirley's nightmare". I took some notes about it and added
this short story to my reading list.

It's funny how random the situation is in Lud when the plot is revealed, but
their case was much more complicated üòÖ. The situation in The Lottery was just a
matter of people doing something just because it was "how things were done".

It feels a lot like religion to me. People doing stuff because if they don't do
it, bad things may happen. The opposite is also true, if they stop doing things,
good things will not happen anymore.

It's a very short story, but makes us think about many things. Totally worth
reading, IMO. There's even an audio version, which I recommend:
