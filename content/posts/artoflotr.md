Book: [The Art of The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24886320) by Wayne G. Hammond. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This is one of those books for Tolkien fans. I do not recommend it if you did not read other books by Tolkien.

It is nice to read if you already read **The Hobbit** and [The Lord of the Rings](/lotr). This book shows a lot of details that Tolkien used as a guideline to write the book. He did not consider himself an artist but this book shows awesome drawings made by him.

As it's about all drawings made during the writing of The Lord of the Rings, there are some drafts of drawings and other stuff that is not interesting. I found amazing how he managed to calculate how many miles Frodo and Sam had to walk to Mount Doom and synchronize that with the last battle in the gates of Mordor.
