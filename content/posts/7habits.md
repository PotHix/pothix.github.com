Book: [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072) by Stephen R. Covey. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This is a good book. There are some good examples there and it is worth reading, but if you want to understand the habits in a quick and easy manner just read on author's website.

# Insights from the book (don't read if you don't want to know anything before reading)

There are some great insights, at least for me, in this book. The author says that the world works on the "outside in" but we need to work on the "inside out", taking care of ourselves and doing the best to make things better.

We need to focus on things we can change, not on abstract things that depends on someone else or any other entity.

Begin with the end in mind, don't let other people shape your way.

We see the world as we are and not as it really is, sometimes we need to put ourselves in the other people shoes to really understand how is their vision.
