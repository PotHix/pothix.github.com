In 2017 I had the chance to speak at [FOSDEM](/fosdem2017) in
[Brussels](brussels), and I used this opportunity to travel around Belgium a
bit, one city every day. One of the cities I visited was Antwerp.

Being very honest, it's definitely not a city I would visit again. The best
part of the city for me was the train station, which is trully beautiful. I
would recommend people to stop there, see the train station and move on.

## Stay

TBD

## Transport

I did everything walking, the city is not that big and I like walking.
I got the train to get there from Ghent and then got the train again
to go to [Rotterdam](rotterdam). The main reason why I decided to stop
in Antwerp was because it was literally in the way of going to Rotterdam
from Ghent.

## Places

* The train station is quite nice. It's the place I spent some time, just
  looking around.

## Food

* Nothing that I remember and it's worth listing. Just cheap food and nice fries. :)
