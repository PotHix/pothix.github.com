After speaking at [FOSDEM](/fosdem2017), I did a bigger trip through a few
countries, and one of them was England. I'm a big fan of Tolkien, so I decided
to explore Oxford too. I wrote more about it on the page [Oxford for Tolkien
fans](/oxford-tolkien).

## Stay

We got an airbnb not far from the main street where the universities were. I
think 15 minutes walking were enough to get there. Nothing to complain about
the airbnb, the host was very polite and helpful. I don't really think it's
worth mentioning them here as it's been 5 years since I've been there and the
listing may be very volatile, but if you really want it, please ping me and I
can try to find it.

## Transport

I got there by train and the rest was just walking around. Didn't use any kind
of transportation inside the city.

## Places

- **Magdalen College**: Great university to visit. They have the ‚ÄúAddison‚Äôs
  Walk‚Äù where the Inklings talked about religion and where C.S Lewis was
  converted to Christianity.
- **Blackwell bookshop**: A nice bookshop that has a section dedicated to
  Tolkien.
- **Bodleian Library and Radcliff camera**: On Wednesdays they have (at least
  they had, in 2017) a bigger tour through the library and underground, so it's
  the best day to visit. The library is quite old and great to visit.

## Food

- **Eagle and Child**: The place where the Inklings (J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S.
  Lewis, et al) met for their meetings. It's quite a nice pub.
- **The lamb and (???) [I really don't remember üòÖ]**: is the other pub that
  the Inklings used for the meetings. Not bad at all and quite close to the
  Eagle and Child.
