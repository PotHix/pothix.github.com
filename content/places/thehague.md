After speaking at [FOSDEM](/fosdem2017), I did a bigger trip through a few
countries, and one of them was the Netherlands. While going from Rotterdam to
Amsterday, I decided to spend a few hours (almost a day) in The Hague.

## Transport

I took a train there from Rotterdam and after that I got a bus. I don't really
remember how those work, but it was quite simple for me to navigate it without
any experience. Got to the place I wanted without major problems. :)

## Places

- **Spinoza Museum**: The main reason why I wanted to go to The Hague was the
  Espinoza Museum. It's probably one of my best experiences in museuns ever.
  The museum is located at the house where Spinoza lived most of his life, and
  it's not a popular place by any means. The place is mostly ran by volunteers,
  which made the experience even better. I got there with 2 more [random]
  people and we spend almost 3 hours talking about the museum and Spinoza's
  life. The old guy there was very excited to show us the place, explain the
  details, and tell us more about Spinoza himself.
