I've been in Porto for the first time in 2017 when I first joined
[Doist](/doist), but also had the chance to visit the city in 2019 in the
company retreat.

I really like the city. Unlike Lisbon, it feels like a city that is not so big
but is also not so small. To me, it feels right in the middle of a big and small
city, with historical places and nice views.

## Torre dos cl√©rigos

I enjoyed my visit there. The view from the top is nice, and the whole place is
very historic.

## Wine tours

I didn't do any, but I visited a place to have a few different wines. If you
like (or never tasted!) Porto wine, I totally recommend it.

## Francesinha

It's a traditional dish of the place, I really recommend you to try one.

## Walking tour

There are many walking tours starting from the main square. I'm a big fan of
walking tours and this was no exception.
