I still remember the first time a friend of mine went to Strange Loop and said
the conference was quite cool. When I realized it would the last edition of the
conference, I decided to do my best to go to St. Louis and participate. The last
edition happened in September 2023, and my description below reflects that.

## Stay

Union Station Hotel is a great place to stay, especially if the conference is
happening there and you get a discount code for your stay ðŸ˜…. I paid ~$800 for
4 days stay.

It's a historical building, where the old train station used to be. The old
train station is a famous place and received thousands of travelers every day
in the past. It's sad that the USA don't have decent trains going everywhere
anymore, but at least they kept the place.

It's one of the most beautiful hotel lobbies I ever seen (my experience is
limited, though).

## Airport

The airport is quite small, but I have nothing to complain about, everything
worked well for me. My flight was 5AM, so I had to arrive there ~3AM to be able
to get my flight. I think this is a tradeoff of a small airport/city.

## Transport

They have the Metro Link, which is a train that connects the airport to the
city center. It worked great. I was able to get from the airport to the city
center spending $4, and it took 40 minutes.

Other than that, there's not much transport other than cars, it's a very car
centric city. I decided to walk around and felt quite weird. It was as if I was
doing something wrong. The only people in the streets were homeless.

You will mostly rely on Ride apps or renting a car, unfortunataly.
