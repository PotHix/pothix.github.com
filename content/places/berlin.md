In July 2023, after going to [Bad Liebenzell](badliebenzell), I still had ~1 week
before the Doist retreat, so I decided to visit some friends in Berlin and
get to know the city. It was a great experience.

## Stay

I stayed at Park Plaza Berlin Kudamm. The experience was great. I have to say
it's the best hotel I stayed paying with my own money (not paid by a company or
conference). I usually stay in hostels or airbnbs, so any 3 star hotel has
sufficient credentials to have this badge though.

That said, the hotel is nice. Decent breakfast, nice and clean room, good
enough location for what I need (not that close to mot touristic attractions
though, if that's what you're looking for). The cost was a bit more than what I
wanted to pay (‚Ç¨1200 for 7 days) but it was the cheaper one on booking, so ü§∑.

## Airport

I only got to know Berlin Brandenburg, while going to Pisa after spending some
time in Berlin, as I arrived in Berlin by train.

The airport is not close to the city, but other than that, it worked well for
me.

I got the train in downtown and got to the airport in ~1 hour.

## Transport

I got to Berlin by train, coming from Bad Liebenzell in a 7 hours trip. A bit
tiresome, especially because I decided to work from the train, but it was fine.
It was quite comfortable compared to many other similar trips I had to do.
Trains ‚ù§Ô∏è.

I decided to bike much more this trip, by recommendation of a friend. I tried
to register to use Next bike and it required a phone number, and I couldn't do
it (my brazilian number is not working here). A friend of mine kindly lended me
his account for a few days and it was a great experience to bike around the
city. Berlin is mostly flat and has bike lanes in most places, I would totally
recommend it.

I also used trains to move around, they are even less expensive than renting
bikes. I was usually buying 4 tickets and using from time to time. If you're
going to use the train a lot, I would recommend the weekly pass (if you're
staying a week or more, of course).

## Places

- A friend of mine recommended the Walkative! walking tour and I decided to go
  for it. I got the tour about Berlin under the Nazi's regime. It was very
  informative (and a bit sad). I enjoyed it.
- Brandenburg gate - Many things happened there. The statue at the top was the
  "goddess" of peace. Napoleon invaded the city through the Brandenburg gates,
  won the battle and stole the statue. After many years, they got the statue
  back and made it the goddess of victory. It's also worth noting that it was
  also quite close to part of the berlin wall, so you may have seen footages of
  it online along with the wall if you searched for it.
