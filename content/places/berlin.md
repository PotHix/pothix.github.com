In July 2023, after going to [Bad Liebenzell](badliebenzell), I still had ~1 week
before the Doist retreat, so I decided to visit some friends in Berlin and
get to know the city. It was a great experience.

## Stay

I stayed at Park Plaza Berlin Kudamm.

## Airport

I only got to know Berlin Brandenburg, while going to Pisa after spending some
time in Berlin, as I arrived here by train.

The airport is not close to the city, but other than that, it worked well for
me.

I got the train in downtown and got to the airport in ~1 hour.

## Transport

I got to Berlin by train, coming from Bad Liebenzell in a 7 hours trip. A bit tiresome,
especially because I decided to work from the train, but it fine.

The train works well in the city.
