In July 2023, after going to [Bad Liebenzell](badliebenzell), I still had ~1 week
before the Doist retreat, so I decided to visit some friends in Berlin and
get to know the city. It was a great experience.

## Stay

I stayed at Park Plaza Berlin Kudamm. The experience was great. I have to say
it's the best hotel I stayed paying with my own money (not paid by a company or
conference). I usually stay in hostels or airbnbs, so any 3 star hotel has
sufficient credentials to have this badge though.

That said, the hotel is nice. Decent breakfast, nice and clean room, good
enough location for what I need (not that close to mot touristic attractions
though, if that's what you're looking for). The cost was a bit more than what I
wanted to pay (‚Ç¨1200 for 7 days) but it was the cheaper one on booking, so ü§∑.

## Airport

I only got to know Berlin Brandenburg while going to Pisa after spending some
time in Berlin, as I arrived in Berlin by train.

The airport is not close to the city, it's around 1h by train, but it's quite
easy to get there by buying an extended (ABC) ticket and taking the S train.
Arrive in the terminal 1, and I had to go to the terminal 2, and it took me
around 10 minutes to get there. The security and boarding was quite simple, but
I was doing a 1-bag trip, so YMMV.

## Transport

I got to Berlin by train, coming from Bad Liebenzell in a 7 hours trip. A bit
tiresome, especially because I decided to work from the train, but it was fine.
It was quite comfortable compared to many other similar trips I had to do.
Trains ‚ù§Ô∏è.

I decided to bike much more this trip, by recommendation of a friend. I tried
to register to use Next bike and it required a phone number, and I couldn't do
it (my brazilian number is not working here). A friend of mine kindly lended me
his account for a few days and it was a great experience to bike around the
city. Berlin is mostly flat and has bike lanes in most places, I would totally
recommend it.

I also used trains to move around, they are even less expensive than renting
bikes. I was usually buying 4 tickets and using from time to time. If you're
going to use the train a lot, I would recommend the weekly pass (if you're
staying a week or more, of course).

## Services

- **Togo Waschwelt GmbH**: This was a one bag trip for me, which limits the
  amount of stuff I will bring and carry, so I planned to wash my clothes in
  the middle of the trip. I went to this place and the experience was superb.
  There was a lady there who helped me navigate the whole process and it was a
  seamless experience. In less than one hour I was leaving the place with all
  my clothes clean and dry. 

## Places

I decided to have the "history theme" into this trip, so I'm mostly visiting
places about the history of Germany and Berlin. This is a bit depressing,
because the history of Germany is... complicated, but I wanted to really
understand a few things.

- **Walking tour from Alexander Platz** - A friend of mine recommended the
  Walkative! walking tour and I decided to go for it. I got the tour about
  Berlin under the Nazi's regime. It was very informative (and a bit sad). I
  enjoyed it.
- **Brandenburg gate** - Many things happened there. The statue at the top was
  the "goddess" of peace. Napoleon invaded the city through the Brandenburg
  gates, won the battle and stole the statue. After many years, they got the
  statue back and made it the goddess of victory. It's also worth noting that
  it was also quite close to part of the berlin wall, so you may have seen
  footages of it online along with the wall if you searched for it.
- **Berlin wall memorial** - They perserved part of the wall as it was at the
  time and created a memorial for it. It's nice to understand the context and
  how complicated it was for people living around the wall at the time. For a
  south american guy, it was quite amazing to finally understand it.
- **East side galery** - Part of the Berlin wall that was kept in the East
  (Socialist part, under the Soviet control). It's full of nice drawing by
  artists from many places in the world and it's still a place for protests in
  form of art against big problems in the world.
- **Topography of terror** - It's the place where the SS and Gestapo was
  located. It's free to enter and has most of the story of the Nazism era.
  Totally recommended if you're into getting more context of the story of that
  time.
- **Berlin Story Bunker** - The bunker where Hitler commited suicide after
  losing the war. It tells his whole story, from being a teenager that wanted
  to be an artist, to the mass murderer dictator. The museum is great, and it
  was the most depressing of all. It is very detailed and shows pictures of
  many things that happened during that era. It was the first museum I went
  that I literally felt angry by following the exposition and getting all the
  context. I woult totally recommend people to go, but you have to be ready for
  that.
- **German Museum of Technology** - I like to visit technology museums every
  time I visit a city and they have one. This was no different, great
  experience. They had trains from the last 100 years to show, including the
  Nazi era. Seeing the trains evolving to match the needs of the people was
  quite nice. Other than that, they also had tons of old ships and airplanes.
  The World war I and II airplanes were quite interesting.
- **Checkpoint Chalie** - The US military checkpoint between West and East
  Berlin. There were many of them, but checkpoint charlie became the most
  famous one as it was the only to allow outsiders to cross. It was also the
  place where the tense picture of the US and USSR tanks facing off. It's an
  interesting place to visit and imagine the whole scene.
- I also visited some alternative places of Berlin with a friend of mine. He is
  into the social part of the city and it was interesting to see things outside
  of the touristic agenda. I'm not going to list places here, but just want to
  mention as a thank you note to him and also a reminder for my future self.

## Food

- **Shiso burger** - Didn't eat much there, just got the sweet potatoes, but
  nothing to complain. I quite like the food and place.
