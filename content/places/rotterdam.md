In 2017 I had the chance to speak at [FOSDEM](/fosdem2017) in
[Brussels](brussels), and I used this opportunity to do a bigger travel through
a few countries in Europe. After visiting a few cities in Belgium, I went
up to Rotterdam.

## Stay

I stayed in the cube houses, which is a very iconic place in Rotterdam and it's now
a hostel! It was an amazing experience and I totally recommend it.

## Transport

Other than getting the train to get there, I didn't use the transport much, as far as
I remember. I spent only one day there, so I didn't need much for what I wanted to see.

## Places

- The cube houses, for sure. It's quite nice, even if you don't want to actually stay there.

## Food

* Nothing that I remember and it's worth listing.
