I went for a motorcycle trip to Argentina in 2012. The whole description (in
pt-BR) can be found [here](moto-argentina).

## Stay

I stayed at [Hotel Cabanas Don
Juan](https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Hotel_Review-g1207950-d4883017-Reviews-Cabanas_Don_Juan-Eldorado_Province_of_Misiones_Litoral.html)
sharing a room with some other people from the motorcycle group I was part of.
I don't remember complaining about anything while I was there.

## Transport

I don't have much to say as I was riding my motorcycle. It was pretty OK to drive there.

## Places
