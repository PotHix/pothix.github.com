In June 2022 I had the chance to spend 3 days in Munich while preparing for the
[Doist](/doist) retreat. Unfortunately, I was not feeling well in the second day
of the trip, so it was mostly 2 working days, but I enjoyed it.

It was interesting to see how Germans are totally fine on doing topless or
changing in public places. Not in the street, but close to the river, for
example.

To me, it was quite unexpected to see people using the river in the same way as
we use a beach in Brazil. I had the chance to be there in a holiday, so there
was a bunch of people there just enjoying life, drinking beer, etc.

I also met a friend who is living in Berlin for some years, and it was an
amazing conversation on how Munich is different from Berlin. :)

## Things to do

As usual, I did a walking tour with a guide and had the chance to walk around
the city center and listen to some stories. It was great to see the medieval
Munich and where the walls were in the past.

It was nice to see how some buildings in Munich would ressemble some famous ones
available in Florence, as I had plans to go there one week after.

### BMW Museum

I quite enjoyed the place. A lot of good information about how BMW started and
many engines to see. I was quite surprised to know that BMW started as an
airplane engines company and then moved to cars.

The whole context of BMW in the world wars was also something I enjoyed reading
about.

I'm not very into cars, but if you like it, it will be a delight to see so many
models there. I quite enjoyed seeing motorcycles and airplane engines, tho.

It was amazing to understand how an airplane combustion engine works. I got the
full picture by looking at one that was cut out, and you could see the internals.
I was not aware of the way they did to open the valves. ðŸ¤“

## Food & drinks

I went to a Biergarten which was quite traditional in Munich.

- Leo's lounge restaurant bar - Had a common German lunch there and it was
  good. As usual, I'm wrinting this at least one year after and I have no idea
  what it was, but the experience was good.
- I got ate a DÃ¶ner kebab for the first time. A friend of mine is muslim and
  was looking for Halal food, so I went with him in a very small Turkish
  restaurant and we got a DÃ¶ner kebab. I liked it.
- Herrschaftszeiten - Das Paulaner im Tal - When with people from work and we
  had a great time there. It's a traditional bavarian restaurant.
