In July 2023, I used the chance of being in Europe to get to know people
from a company I've been taking care of their main app for 7 years already.

They would be celebrating 70 years of their company in Bad Liebenzell. Things
aligned so much that I would be "close" with 10 days differece. It was hard
to arrange things at home, but I was able to meet them.

## Stay

I stayed at Hotel Koch.

## Airport

Bad Liebenzell does not have an airport. I came here via Frankfurt.

For Brazilians, LATAM has directly flights from GRU (SÃ£o Paulo) and Frankfurt
at the time of this writing (July 2023), so it may be a good solution to visit
the city.

The airport has a train station inside, so you can buy the ticket and go straight
to Bad Liebenzell in ~1h30.

## Transport

It's a small city, consider walking everywhere. :)
