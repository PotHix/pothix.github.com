In July 2023, I used the chance of being in Europe to get to know people
from a company I've been doing some maintenance work 7 years.

They would be celebrating 70 years of their company in Bad Liebenzell. Things
aligned so much that I would be "close" with 10 days differece from my company
retreat, so I did all I could to be able to go. It was hard to arrange things
at home, but I was able to meet them.

After so many years, I remember seeing some of them (via video) just a few
times (maybe 5 times), and I was very excited to meet them all. It was a great
experience.

## Stay

I stayed at Hotel Koch. It was a great stay. I got some delayed trains to get
there and the Hotel did their best to accomodate my late arrival. The room was
good, the breakfast fast great, the staff is nice. Nothing to complain, really.

## Airport

Bad Liebenzell does not have an airport. I came here via Frankfurt.

For Brazilians, LATAM has directly flights from GRU (SÃ£o Paulo) and Frankfurt
at the time of this writing (July 2023), so it may be a good solution to visit
the city.

The airport has a train station inside, so you can buy the ticket and go straight
to Bad Liebenzell in ~1h30.

## Transport

It's a small city, consider walking everywhere. :)

## Places

- **Kurhaus** - WE had a general meeting at the Kurhaus, along with a lunch for
  the whole team. It was quite hot for the meeting and the place does not have
  air conditioning. Other than that, nothing much to complain.
- **Bad Wildbad** - Bad Wildbad is a different city, but I don't think it's
  worth listing it as such since I just went there for a few hours. We got the
  cable ca and did a hike to a big structure where you can have nice views and
  then use their slide to go down tens of meters. Nice place to visit and it's
  ~30 mins from Bad Liebenzell by car.

## Food

- **Oscar's hotel restaurant** - We went for dinner at Oscar's and I really
  enjoyed the Salmon. I asked for a Tiramisu for desert and the guy brought me
  something nice, but was surely not a tiramisu (although he said it was ðŸ˜…).
