A friend of mine was driving us to nice places around Lisbon and he recommended
us to go to Cascais, which is a place he likes.

## Transport

We went there by car with a friend, so not much to say about other ways of transport.

## Places

- **Centro hist√≥rico**: Just walking around the historic center is great. If
  you have some time, go do it.
- **Forte Nossa Senhora da Luz de Cascais**: Small fortress, not expensive to
  get it. I enjoyed the visit.
- **Boca do inferno**: A famous place where you can see the waves smashing into
  the rocks and the cave. I really liked the visit. The whole place is quite
  relaxing.

## Food

- **Restaurante O batel**: This was the place we chose to have lunch during the
  car trip and I have nothing to complain about it. I'm writing this 4 years
  after the visit, os I can't really say what I had at the time, I just
  remember it was good it not very expensive.
