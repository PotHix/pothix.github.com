I visited San Francisco in 2012. It was my first international trip by airplane
(I literally returned from a motorcycle trip to Argentina less than a week
before) ever. I went to Openstack conference, as it was something we (the
company I worked for) were into at the time.

It's been more than 10 years since I went there (writing this in 2023), so take
the recommendations here with a grain of salt. ðŸ˜‰

## Stay

My friend was living there and I stayed a few days at his house. After that, I
went for an Openstack conference and the hotel was paid by the company.

The conference happened at the Embarcadero conference center (To be confirmed)
and I stayed at the same hotel.

As far as I remember, great service and facilities. No idea about the cost x
benefit, though. I would probably not stay there if it was paid by me. ðŸ˜…

## Airport

The airport is not close to the city, I remember getting a cab for ~30 minutes
to get there.
