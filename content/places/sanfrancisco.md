I visited San Francisco in 2012. It was my first international trip ever. I
went to Openstack conference, as it was something we (the company I worked for)
were into at the time.

It's been more than 10 years since I went there (writing this in 2023), so take
the recommendations here with a grain of salt. ðŸ˜‰
