As part of a 1-week trip through Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ in 2022, I had the chance to spend 2
days in Florence with my wife and sister.

## Stay

After staying on a Penzione in Venice, we decided to get a Hotel for Firenze. We
got a 3-star hotel with an amazing location, right in front of the main
basilica. The hotel is called Hotel Bigallo.

The place is good enough for what we wanted. The breakfast was good, and the
location is amazing. The room is smaller than we expected, and the bathroom door
was not locking, but these were very small details for us.

## Things to do

- Walking tour
- Visit the basilica
- Palazzo Vechio
- Palazzo Pitti
- Bobolli gardens (a bit disappointing)
- Uffizi galeries
- Dell'a academia (we did not go there)
- Statues

## Food & drinks

- Bucca Mario (Reservation needed)
- Gelattos everywhere

## Transport

We arrived by train on Firenze Maria Novella from Venezia Santa Lucia. Our hotel
was just 10-15 mins walking from the train station.

Walking is the preferred way of doing things in Firenze. You can reach most
attractions in a walking distance, ~20 minutes max.

To move to Rome, we went to Fizenze Santa Maria Novella walking. We got a huge
delay this time. Our train got late by ~50 minutes.
