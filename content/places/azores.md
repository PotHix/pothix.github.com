I went to Azores (actually, AÃ§ores in Portuguese) in the Doist company retreat
of 2019. It was a hell of a ride to get there because there was a lot of
complication to leave Uruguay (I was organizing [Rust LATAM](/rustlatam2019))
and get there. Maybe it's a story for a different context.

## Anana

We visited a place where they cultivate a specific local Anana. It looks like a
pineapple, but it has its own category.

## Bus tour

We did a bus tour through the island and got some amazing views
