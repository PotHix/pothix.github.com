A friend of mine was driving us to nice places around Lisbon and we went to
Colares just to see one single place: Cabo da Roca.

## Transport

We went there by car with a friend, so not much to say about other ways of
transport. Not sure if it would be easy to visit using trains.

## Places

- **Cabo da roca**: The view from the mountains and the see is astonishing, it
  was a great place to visit. We spent some time chating and appreciating the
  views.
