I had the chance to visit Lisbon two times, both of them visiting friends and
staying with them.

## Stay

I have friends living there and they kindly offered a spare room in their
appartment for us to stay while traveling. It was amazing to have the day to
explore the city and spend the night with them playing cards, having some good
wine, or even having dinner somewhere.

The other time I went, there was another friend of mine hosting me for a long
layover, so I would not have to sleep at the airport or look for a place for
one night.

After finding these people, I realize that travel is becoming much less about
places and umch more about people we like. :)

## Airport

The airport is good enough, nothing to complain. There's a train that you can
use to go from the airport to the main city

## Transport

The subway and trains work great to go anywhere we wanted to go. If

## Places

- **Parque das nações**: A redeveloped area which became a large modern park. A
  friend of mine was walking us around the place. I was quite different than
  what I was expecting, and I enjoyed it.

## Food

- TBD
