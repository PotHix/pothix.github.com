In 2017 I had the chance to speak at [FOSDEM](/fosdem2017) in
[Brussels](brussels), and I used this opportunity to travel around Belgium a
bit, one city every day. One of the cities I visited was Ghent.

Ghent is certainly the city I enjoyed visiting the most in this whole trip. The
city itself is quite nice and small and there a nice castle in the middle of
it.

It is worth mentioning that it was in Ghent that I saw snow for the first time
in my whole life. :)

## Stay

I stayed in a hostel that had a great location, quite close to a famous bridge
and cathedral. I would definitely recommend there. The place itself is far from
being the best hostel I stayed, but the view is trully something i still
remember after many years.

## Transport

I used the tram to get to the hostel and it worked well, but most of the time I
was just walking around. I got the tram because it was quite cold and I was
looking for a warmer place.


## Places

* The castle is definitely something worth visiting. I really enjoyed the
  experience.
* I did the "Legends of Ghent" walking tour and it was quite nice. I still
  remember the guide doing jokes with people from Bruges

## Food

* Nothing that I remember and it's worth listing. Just cheap food and nice
  fries. :)
