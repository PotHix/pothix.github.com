In January 2023, my team at Doist had a meeting in Paris, so I schedule one
week before the meeting to be a tourist in Paris. What I'm writing below is a
combination of the time I had as a tourist with my wife **and** the places we
visited before/after work.

## Stay

Hotel Louvre Richelieu

## Places

Eiffel tower

## Food

None yet
