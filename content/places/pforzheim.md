While going to [Bad Liebenzell](badliebenzell) from [Frankfurt](frankfurt), I
had to forcefully stop in Pforzheim for a bit more than 2 hours. My trains were
delayed and I had to wait for the last train to get to Bad Liebenzell.

## Transport

When I realized I had to wait a few hours for the train, I decided to try Uber
or Taxis to get me there, as it would be a trip of less than 30 mins.

Didn's any taxi after leaving the train station. Tried Uber and after waiting
for 10 minutes, nobody took the ride.

Your only hope is that trains take you to where you have to go. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Food

- **Random sandwitch place (name To Be Added)** - I was very hungry and it was
  Sunday, 21:00 PM. There was a few restaurants open, but I thought it would be
  too cumbersome to figure out how to order something. I went to this place and
  got a burger + fries. I could see the oil coming out of the burger, but it
  was good enough given the situation.
