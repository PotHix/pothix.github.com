In July 2023, the [Doist](/doist) retreat happened in Artimino, which is part
of the province of Prato. My descriptions here will be only related to that
part of Prato.

## Stay

I stayed in the Artimino village, on the other side of the Artimino hotel,
which is close to the historic house of the Medici. It's a medieval city and
contains many different rooms of this hotel (~90 rooms) and a few restaurants.

I'm a big fan of medieval places and it's always amazing to stay in a village
like that. The place is quite modernized, though. They have a pool and even a
SPA there.

## Airport

Arrived via Florence

## Transport

Via taxi

## Places

- **Circolo ricreativo**: It's a bar that is quite close to the hotel. We had
  aa company happy hour there and was nice.
- **Erato Wellness Luxury SPA**:  I had the chance to book a few hours there as
  part of the company package and it was very relaxing. They have a combination
  of hot water/sauna combined with cold water and ice (classic SPA). The place
  is clean, with some relaxing music going on.


## Food

- **Biagio pignatta**: We had a pasta making class there and ate the past we
  made. It was great.
- **La cantina dei Redi**: It's in the village and the default place to have
  breakfast for my group. Very friendly staff and a good variety of food.
