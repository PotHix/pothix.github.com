Frankfurt was just a connecting city for me. I was going to [Bad
Liebenzell](badliebenzell) and LATAM has direct flights from SÃ£o Paulo to
Frankfurt.

## Airport

The airport is good and I was able to go through security quite quickly. Many
people change planes in Frankfurt and I had the chance to be in the first
seats, so I left before other people. These two facts helped me to go straight
to the border control and go through the process quite fast.

## Transport

The airport is right next to the train station, I just had to leave the airport
and walk 10 minutes to get there. Got an ICE train and went to Bad Liebenzell.
