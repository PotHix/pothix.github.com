In July 2022 I spent 3 days in Rome and quite enjoyed it. The only problem was
the extreme heat and crowded city, but other than that, things went great.

## Stay

I stayed on a BnB called CityLife Rome. I booked it on booking as I was
traveling with my wife and sister and was looking for a place for 3 that was
affortable and had a great location.

This place is quite close to the Roma Termini, giving you access to the
lines A and B and a lot of flexibility to use the Metro.

The location proved to be a great advantage and the hosts were very responsive
to everything. We even had a power outage situation in the whole building, and
they did their best to have the situation fixed ASAP.

## Places

Rome is a big city and there are many amazing places to see.

## Food

People who know me are aware that I'm not very into food. This is usually not a
priority for me when I'm travelling, but I'm making an exception for Italy.

In Rome, I did not look for anything specific, but decided to look for
good-rated places and try different kinds of foods.

I tried:

* Pastaciutta
