Dallas was just a connection while going to [St. Louis](stlouis). Keep that in
mind when reading the rest of what I describe here.

## Airport

The airport is quite big. I had to use their Air Train to get to another
terminal for my connection. I was lucky to not have baggage checked-in, because
I would have to re-check and go through security **again** before going for my
connection.

My flight was delayed and the airport crew was not very concerned about people
having only 30min to get their connection. I have a feeling they didn't make it
on time and had to reschedule.

Keep in mind that, if you're coming from an international trip, you're going to
leave the plane, go through passport control, get your bags, go through
security again, check your bags again, and then get your connection. Plan
accordingly so you will have enough time to do everything.
