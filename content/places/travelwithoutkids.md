title: "Travel (without kids)"

I have [a long list of places I visited](/places) and if you look at the
descriptions you will notice a pattern on how I usually travel. I decided to
write this one, so I can refer to it most of the time. Here I'm going to
describe how I like to travel when I'm alone or with my wife.

I currently have 2 kids and travelling with kids is a totally different kind of
trip that I will describe in a different post.

## Gear

I'm an adept of the [onebag](https://reddit.com/r/onebag)  travel, so I mostly
use only one backpack to travel.

As I'm writing this post, the Minaal travel and the PeakDesign Travel are our
travel gear. I totally recommend both of them, but if I had to choose one, it
would be the PeakDesign travel.

## Schedule

I usually have a very packed schedule when I'm travelling and the pattern is
mostly the same:

- ~8:00 Wake up and get ready for the day. Have breakfast before leaving if
  available or just stop somewhere for some coffee.
- ~10:00 Going somewhere I want so visit
- ~13:00 Stop for lunch. Most of the time, I try to not spend that much time on
  restaurants.
- ~14:00 Seeing more stuff
- ~19:00 Dinner time
- ~20:00 Depending on the season and how tired we are, we go for some nightly
  sightseeing. At night, some structures are quite beautiful.
- ~23:00 Going to sleep

It's not strict, but that's usually the structure I follow. Going back to the
hotel/hostel/BnB during the day is not something I usually do. I also tend to
eat in places with decent toilets because it's an important part to make this
whole plan work

## Free Walking tour

I'm a big fan of walking everywhere. If possible, I would totally avoid any
kind of transport and will go walking. It's common for me to have 25k+ steps
registered on my watch in one day while travelling.

Because of that, I discovered "Free" walking tours. They are not actually free,
but it's a _Pay what you want_ kind of tour, and I really enjoy it.

Every time I arrive to a new city, I try to book a walking tour because it is
cheap, fun, and gives me a bunch of information to see the city in a new way in
the next following days.

You also get some bonus information on places to eat from someone who actually
lives in the city.

I have so many learnings that I got from these tours. Just to give some
examples:

- Simbols spread over the city have meanings. On the next following days I will
  spot most of them and understand why they are there.
- Local restaurants that local people go, not tourists.
- General tips like: Don't enter a restaurant if there are pictures of food in
  front of it, there's a good chance it will be a tourist trap.
- Unwritten rules about doing safe travel on that city.
- The list goes on. I highly recommend starting your trip with something like
  this.
