The [Doist](/doist) retreat 2022 happened in Pertisau, so I had the chance to
visit Austria for the first time ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹!

I really enjoyed the city. We got there in summer, and I heard it's a totally
different town in the winter. It's quite cool to see how they adapt sports for
the season. As an example of things I saw: they have Ski on winter, lake
swimming and paragliding on summer.

## Things we did

- Museum
- Fischergut
- SPA
- Boat trip
- Mountain hike

## Food & Drinks

- Hike + Restaurant
- Piramid cafe
- Restaurant by the lake (SPA?)

## Transport

I arrived via bus with the Doist crew, so there's not muxh to talk about it.
While we were in the city, we did almost everything by food, as the village is
not that big. That was a huge bonus point for me. :)

My plan for the 2022 trip was to go to Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ afterwards, so I bought a
train ticket on OBB from Jenback to Venice.

A friend of mine was kind enough to give me a ride to Jenback from Pertisau
(~20min by car) when he was leaving, so the process was quite smooth.

It was a 5h trip to get to Venice, but things were quite simple to figure out,
maybe because it's not my first train trip on Europe.
