The [Doist](/doist) retreat 2022 happened in Pertisau, so I had the chance to
visit Austria for the first time üá¶üáπ!

I really enjoyed the city. We got there in summer, and I heard it's a totally
different town in the winter. It's quite cool to see how they adapt sports for
the season. As an example of things I saw: they have Ski on winter, lake
swimming and paragliding on summer.

## Stay

I stayed in the Karlwirt hotel. The company booked some nearby hotels for us
and I was selected to that one. Nothing to complain about my stay, it was
great. I don't really know the price though, so I can't say about the cost x
benefit.

The breakfast was great too.

## Things we did

- **Museum**: There's a small museum right below the Piramid cafe with a bit of
  the story of the village and some local products. I enjoyed the visit. It's
  nice to know more about the history of the place I'm visiting. :)
- **Fischergut** - It was the old place where the fichers got together in the
  past. We used it as the central place to get everyone together for workshops,
  food, parties, and other company activities.
- **F√ºnfhaus am Achensee**: We used the SPA service and it was a great
  experience. üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Cable car**: I don't really remember the name of the place, but if you look
  for a cable car, you will probably get there. We took the cable car to get to
  the top of the mountain. The view was amazing. We had a drink and some food
  there. There's a restaurant on top that seems to be called **Erfurter
  H√ºtte**.

## Food & Drinks

- Hike + Restaurant
- Langlaufst√ºberl - Nice restaurant. Had a good meal and wine there. Would
  certainly recommend.
- **Boat trip (Pl√§latenbuche): We did a boat trip and lunch around the lake.
  Great views and nice food. Totally recommended (even though I have motion
  sickness and it's never that good for me üòÖ)
- **F√ºnfhaus am Achensee**: We had a dinner there. It was a nice place with
  good food and drinks. I would recommend it.
- **Gramai Alm Alpengenuss & Natur Spa**: We did a hiking to get there and had
  some amazing food. Both the main dish and desert were amazing.
- Piramid cafe: 
- Restaurant by the lake (SPA?)

## Transport

I arrived via bus with the Doist crew, so there's not much to talk about it.
While we were in the city, we did almost everything by foot, as the village is
not that big. That was a huge bonus point for me. :)

My plan for the 2022 trip was to go to Italy üáÆüáπ afterwards, so I bought a
train ticket on OBB from Jenback to Venice.

A friend of mine was kind enough to give me a ride to Jenback from Pertisau
(~20min by car) when he was leaving, so the process was quite smooth.

It was a 5h trip to get to Venice, but things were quite simple to figure out,
maybe because it's not my first train trip on Europe.
