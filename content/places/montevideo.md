In March 2019 happened the [Rust LATAM 2019](/rustlatam2019), which I was one
of the main organizers. It happened in Montevideo, so I had some time to also
walk around the city and get to know a few places.

My plan was to visit a few more places, but the Doist retreat would happen the day after the conference and I wouldn't have enough time to do anything before.
would recommend people to stop there, see the train station and move on.

## Stay

I stayed in a hotel for 1 or 2 days when I arrived and then all organized went
to the same Airbnb so we could reduce costs.

## Transport

I got the bus to come from the airport to the city downtowm. As I usually
travel with one bag, it was quite simple. Other than that, I mostly used Uber
when the distance was not walkable to move around because it was easier.

Walking was mostly OK for the places I wanted to visit.


## Places

* The train station is quite nice. It's the place I spent some time, just
  looking around.

## Food

* Nothing that I remember and it's worth listing. Just cheap food and nice fries. :)
