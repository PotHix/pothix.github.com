It's been a while since I wanted to write down the movies I recommend. There are
so many great movies to recommend that I will never be able to reply from the
top of my head.

This is a list of the movies that I really enjoy. Hopefully, they will be great
for you as well.

## The Lord of the Rings trilogy (200[4,5,6]) - Extended version

It's no secret that I'm a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. I watched The Fellowship of
the Ring 15 times after stop counting. Most of these happened in the first
months/years after the release.

The extended version is great. For Tolkien fans, it's a delight to see many
small details here and there. If you like Tolkien, I definitely recommend you to
watch these.

## Coach Carter (2005)

One of those sports movies based on a real story. It shows how sports and
studies can come hand-in-hand. It shows how sports can save lives and create a
better community. The way Coach Carter deals with the situation and maintain his
position is just amazing.

## The man from earth (2007)

I love this movie. It's a low-budget movie where the whole story happens inside
a house. There are no special effects, no great scenario, just an interesting
dialogue between teachers and a story that makes you think about it.

It touches religion so it may trigger some people, but it's a great concept.
