This is my page of all things code-related.

I've been writing code professioally since 2007 and have some things to show.
Some of them were done on my spare time and others were part of my paid job.

## Paid work

These are projects I've worked full-time while being employed by a company or
working as a freelancer. They are projects I deeply cared about, in one way or
another.

### Locaweb: Cloud PRO

I was the main developer for the Cloud Server PRO product at Locaweb. Worked on
the project since its beta release and improved for 5 years.

It's (mostly) a Ruby+Rails project responsible for the main state machine
provisioning virtual machines on the Xen hypervisor. The application was also
responsible for the configuration of other pieces of infrastructure like DHCP
servers, Firewalls, software defined networks and etc.

### Doist: Todoist

I'm a Todoist user since 2007, when I started my programming career. I joined
Doist in 2017 to take care of API and integrations for Todoist (and Twist).

Todoist is a proprietary software written in Python (python 2 when I joined and
Python 3 nowadays). I've been working on internal and external integratoins
along with taking care of APIs and how these are used by internal and external
clients.

### Doist: Twist

Twist is the messaging app for those who like to focus on their work instead of
fighting the infinite flow of real time communication. I joined Doist some
weeks before the Twist launch. Since then, I'm on the team responsible for the
platform for integrations. The platform includes the API, integrations, and
communication with external developers.


## Hobbies and personal projects

These are projects I mostly did by myself because I love programming and
creating new stuff. Some of them were just personal projects to help someone
thrive in their business.

### [Robotz Warehouse](https://github.com/PotHix/RobotzWarehouse)
