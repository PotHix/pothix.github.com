Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel
again this month. Let's see if it affected my performance.

### Books

I was traveling this month, so as usual, I'm not reading/listening to
audiobooks because I prefer to focus on the place I'm visiting. For
this reason, I did not finish any book this month.

With that said, it is the first time I have 4 books on my reading list
at the same time.

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

[Elixir in Action](http://amzn.to/2EibMyt) is there for some time
now. I really like Elixir and want to finish it as soon as I have the
time. I'm also playing with Rust nowadays, so I'm
reading [Programming Rust](http://amzn.to/2FafTxv) as well.

[The art of invisibility](http://amzn.to/2CQn5Bz) is the current
audiobook and I hope to finish that as soon as I listen to all the
Podcast episodes piled since last
month.

[Hiding in unnatural happiness](http://amzn.to/2FcD6PU) is a book I
received from a monk while in York. I'm not in a rush with this one
but I want to finish soon, it's really small.

### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1296
946
```

It means I have **1296 articles Unread** and **946 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (**1255 unread**
and **931 read**), I got around **1% more unread articles** and **1%
more read articles**.

My unread count is not growing so fast anymore and that is a good
thing.

### Coding

Here are the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Nothing new in this chart this month. The blank parts are related to
the New Year and Christmas holidays.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

`markdown` is usually the most used language because I write long texts in emacs before posting on [Twist](https://twistapp.com).
After that, we have Python and Rust! 😀

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Just removed bash from the reports and now we have Emacs as the only editor being used (it's strange to not have any Vim this month) 🤔

### Speaking

No presentations this month. 😀

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png "")

I already reached all my goals for the year and was OK to not speak
during December. I admit that I tried to speak while I was in York
but could not find any local meetup to speak. :P

I had the chance to participate in two meetups
of [York developers](https://www.yorkdevelopers.org/) but
unfortunately, there were no slots to speak.

### Completed tasks

This is the number of tasks completed on [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png)

**306 tasks** completed this month (**98 less** than last month).

Many holidays and traveling in the last week of the year. I was
totally off and did not check my tasks in these days, this is why I
don't have many tasks done.

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg)

**1 day and 3 hours** of podcast time. I decided to not listen to any
podcast while I was in York because I wanted to enjoy every single
moment while walking in the streets. I usually use Podcasts as a way
to escape from my boring routine in my working days but it was not
boring in York. 😀

As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just remember that this is an "all-time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here is the data from my time tracking software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and the full-time job. The
time doing freelance job was 0 hours this month, unfortunately.

We had 18 work days this month and I worked for 157 hours, which mean
that **I worked 13 hours more than I should**. From these 13 hours,
1:23 hours was in a Sunday but it was in the airplane so it doesn't
count :P.

[![Deep vs Shallow work](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "Deep vs Shallow work")](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "")

What I can take from this chart:

* Meetings are stable. I usually have around 4-5 hours of meetings a month. One useful weekly meeting of around 40 min and one 1-1 meeting. If necessary I have small meetings to fix certain problems.
* Hiring was **really** hard this month. Many interviews and candidates/test reviews.
* Shallow work is still consuming around 60% of my tasks (I'm not counting Hiring as shallow work, BTW)

This time I have a list of what I was doing with my *Shallow
work*. Most of the time I can't describe what was it but I know part
of it is my lunch time.

One of the things I can spot as a time consumer here is the
"Read/Reply Twist". As we are committed to meaningful communication, I
tend to read most of the messages that mention me somehow and some of
them are big threads discussing some important problem. It makes sense
to take some time but I would like to improve it. Maybe next month 😉

Now, let's continue to my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

Yeah, that's right, no personal projects this month. 😞
It's kinda sad that I had not personal projects or freelancing this month. I really like to spend some time working on different projects.

I think it happened for a reason: I was in a different city/country
and invested all my time in my full-time job and walking around the
city. I will try to keep that in my mind. 😀

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

As expected, I don't have enough data because I changed my browser
for [Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) and forgot
to install the rescuetime extension. Shame on me. 😞


### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg "")
[![Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity_comparison.jpg "Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity-comparison.jpg "")

An average of **10k** steps is good for me. It was better than
November but worse than October, which was expected.

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **17.3km** walking in one day (I was lucky to get
the tooltip to work when taking the screenshot):

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg "")

As we can see in the chart, I had more minutes of average sleeping
this month (**7h38m** for the last month) but less deep sleeping (last
month was **1h44**) 😢

Considering the whole user base from mi-band:

[![Sleep comparison with the user base](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg "Sleep comparison with the user base")](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg "")

I'm below average regarding sleeping earlier and on average regarding
deep sleeping.

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 1
episode this month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "")

It was probably **Billions** when I got home. 😀

I spent **1 hour** of my life watching TV shows this month. Not bad 😉.


### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I'm writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **93129** words written (**71062** last month)
+ **1380** corrections made (**1091** last month)
+ **11979** unique words (**17429** last month)

I wrote a lot this month. Almost 20k words more than last month but I
also made more mistakes, almost in the same proportions. My vocabulary
did not increase in the same rhythm though.

### Locations

New cities were added this month:

[![New cities](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png "New cities")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png "")

The missing city is Durham.

Here are the general data:

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png "")

It's really weird that some countries are disappearing. 😞 Last month
I had 7 countries but now I have 6 again. I
used
[Matador network](https://matadornetwork.com/travel-map/22396bbf7ad1af6c0d8758cb54077e13-1515270907) to
track the countries and I visited **8 countries, not 6**.

[![Countries map](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png "Countries map")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png "")

Not so useful, but here is the time spent on vehicles:

[![Location time and distance](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png "")

It's probably the time spent in taxis from home to the airport and
also related to the trip we made in North Yorkshire by van.

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png "")

This trip removed 12k km from my distance to the moon. 👍

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this month**. Yes! You read
that right, I finally received some freaking money after six months! 🎉

This money is still not related to my current job but I already
received my payment, just need to go through the bureaucracy to be
able to pay the taxes and receive that in my personal account.

I will definitely write about this whole process soon.

This month is finally back to normal! My total savings **increased by
1.9%** and now I have **75.10%** of my goal.

Next month will be **huge!**


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric

**It took 3 hours and 02 minutes to write this post**


### Conclusion

I'm back to Brazil after one full month working
from [York](https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982). I have to say that it
was really great to work from a different place for some time.

This was the last month of the year so expect a yearly review from me
soon. 😀
