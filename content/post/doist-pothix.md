**TL;DR:** I'm working on something I really believe is good
at [Doist](https://doist.com) and I feel great.

As I mentioned on [this post](/post/7-anos-de-locaweb-e-a-saida/) (in pt-BR) I
left the company I was working for the last year to join a new company. The new
company is [Doist](https://doist.com), I'm working for them since July.

Some time ago a friend asked me why I joined Doist and I realized it's kind of a
love story so I decided to write the post. 😄

For those who are not aware of Doist, it's the company
behind [Twist](https://twistapp.com) and [Todoist](https://todoist.com). Twist
is a communication tool that aims to make remote communication work and Todoist
is the best task manager I know.

I joined the company in July as I said
but [I'm a Todoist user since 2007](post da gtdbr) and I always recommended my
friends to use it. I tried many task managers in these 10 years but I always get
back to Todoist.

When I started my career as a software engineer in 2006, I decided to also look
for a better way to deal with my tasks. My memory is not very good, so I decided
to look for a system to help me with that and found GTD. For some time I was one
of the moderators of gtd-br, probably the biggest GTD mail list in Brazil and
was looking for an application to manage my tasks.

I was looking for something clean, lightweight, simple, and with support to
keyboard shortcuts. Tried Todledo, Remember the milk, thinking rock, and some
others but none of them were good enough. I was about to create my own when I
found Todoist, it was exactly what I was looking for.

As an active user, I was always following the new features and the use of new
technologies in the product. I remember when they started using HTML5 for their
mobile application, it was really great to see it.

At some point I found that a company called Doist appeared as the creator of
Todoist (it was just Todoist before that) and I started looking to their job
board. There were not so many positions and all of them required a good level of
Python. My focus was always Ruby and I didn't have any experience with large
Python projects.

Some years passed and I participated on some Python projects at work and gained
some experience. I even created a personal project in Python to do some
scrapping for some financial data I wanted, it became a big project but it was
abandoned after Google Finance implemented my main feature. :P

When the time for a change came I decided to apply for companies I admire and
who believe in the same things I do. I also changed my mindset and decided to
not look for technology anymore but for products I believe are really good and
can recommend to my friends and family.

I worked for 5 companies in the past and none of their products were something I
can really recommend to everyone. Most of them don't even exist anymore. Others
are relatively good in one specific use case and country. I was working for
these companies because there were great people, good salary/benefits, or great
technology.

When I saw the position to "API & Integrations" developer at Doist I decided to
apply. I was kind of insecure about the platform change (Ruby -> Python) but I
believe languages are just tools to build something and I was looking for
companies with the same beliefs. I also love to create tools for developers and
did that in the past many times already, so it would be a great fit.

During the interviewing process I found that it was a **perfect** match of beliefs:

+ Remote working
+ Async working (not fixed hours, we believe you will do you job and will follow your metrics)
+ Chance to travel and meet different people/cultures
+ We read nice books and **really** apply their concepts (radical candor, the score takes care of itself, let my people go surfing)
+ Bootstrapped company
+ Amazing perks for remote working
+ Almost the same salary I had

I was already doing remote work 70% of the time for my previous company and I
also have a freelance job for a company in Netherlands, so it would be great to
work full time remote, so I took the job.

Of course not everything is rainbows and unicorns, as everything in life, but
the overall experience is really great. At this moment, I'm writing this blog
post in the airplane (airplanes are the bad part :P), coming back from a trip
where I met 12 members of the team (we're 50+ at the moment) in two different
countries. I also was the person of contact for all hackers doing our challenge
at the HackUPC hackathon in Barcelona, which helped me a lot to collect feedback
of our APIs.

The whole things about the "love story" I mentioned in the beginning of this
post is that Todoist helps me since the beginning of my career and now, after
almost 10 years, I have the change to work for the company behind it. What is
even greater is that the company has the same mindset and beliefs I have.

In this case, instead of using a technology to retain talent, build a
company/product so great that people will want to join to make it even better.
