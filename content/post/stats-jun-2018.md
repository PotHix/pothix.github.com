Guess what!? Yes, metrics for June! üìä

### Books

Two books read this month, but both received a 3 stars review:
[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

+ [Wait, What?: And Life's Other Essential
  Questions](https://amzn.to/2xEnPaM): Exactly what the author says in
  the beginning: It's a lecture that became a book. Not bad, but
  OK-ish.
+ [Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry into the Value of
  Work](https://amzn.to/2Jozn6t): More political views than I was
  expecting and the pacing is not so good. The motorcycles part
  resonates with me a lot.

**Note**: I write a full review for each book I read. You can find
them on [my Goodreads account](https://goodreads.com/pothix).


### Articles

I'm experimenting with [an integration between Pocket and Google
Spreadsheets via IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/p/pothix). The idea is not
to use Javascript codes anymore, but it's still ongoing.

I'm adding a tag to the articles I read and want to include in my list
of _articles read_ for the month. For this month, I'm using the tag
`201805`:

[![Articles read this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/pocket-articles.png "Articles read this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/pocket-articles.png "")

I use a `SUMIF` to sum all lines containing the string `201805`, and
got **26 articles read**.

I did not start at the beginning of the month, and it should be
considered just an experiment for now. I hope to soon change to this
    method of collecting data about the articles read.

Meanwhile, it's worth keeping the old method:

```
var pocket = {"unread":1501,"unread_pct":3.66,"read":1096,"read_pct":4.2}

var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
unread = uls[0].children.length;
pocket["unread_pct"] = +((1 - pocket["unread"] / unread) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket["unread"] = unread;
read = uls[1].children.length;
pocket["read_pct"] = +((1 - pocket["read"] / read) * 100).toFixed(2);
pocket["read"] = uls[1].children.length;
console.log("# Result: " + JSON.stringify(pocket))

# Result: {"unread":1539,"unread_pct":2.47,"read":1146,"read_pct":4.36}
```

It means I have **1539 articles unread** and **1146 articles
read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (**1501 unread**
and **1096 read**), I got around **2.47% more unread articles** and
**4.36% more read articles**.

Still adding more than reading (üòï), but I'm still not sure if this is
a problem. I may never read all those articles I marked to _read
later_, but does it really matter? ü§î

### Coding

Here are the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post. I will start with editors this time:

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Nothing new here, 70-30 between Vim and Emacs.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Not that bad.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2018/jun/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

**Markdown** is back as the first language because of some big posts I
had to write using Emacs. **Python** is the second most used language
because of [Todoist](https://todoist.com) and
[Twist](https://twistapp.com), and **Ruby** is still present there üòâ.

This month I had a little bit of **Rust** and **Go**, which is nice. I think I
will have more Rust next month. üòÄ

### Speaking

No talks this month as well üòï, but one scheduled for the next month. üëç

### Completed tasks

Here is the comparison of the tasks for the last month (first) and the
tasks for this month (second). I extracted it from
[Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed last month](/images/stats/2018/may/gtasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed last month")](/images/stats/2018/may/gtasks-completed.png)
[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/tasks-completed.png)

Things are better this month! Hope to remember to take the screenshot
before the week cycle ends next month.

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/podcasts.jpg)

**2 days and 18 hours** of podcast time. Here is the list of Podcasts
and their times:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2018/jun/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by the title")](/images/stats/2018/jun/podcast_titles.jpg)

Unfortunately, this list is based on time. `Anticast` is not a Podcast
I'm used to listening, but they have some good episodes from time to
time. The problem is that they are quite long (~1h30) while other
shows tend to have episodes of about 30min.

Well, keep in mind that this is an "all-time list", and I'm tracking
time instead of the episode which makes short podcasts not to appear
as "most listened" ones. I listen to [CBN
podcasts](http://audioglobo.globo.com/cbn) almost every day, but they
are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here is the data from my time tracking software,
[Toggl](https://toggl.com) comparing the last month (first) and this
month (second):

[![Hours working using Toggl last month](/images/stats/2018/may/gtoggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl last month")](/images/stats/2018/may/gtoggl-time-working.png "")

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working.png "")

I had 21 work days tracked this month, and I worked for 173 hours,
which mean that **I worked 5 hours more than I should** (the same as I
had in April). Not bad but **the goal is to reach 8 hours and remove
those bars that exceed the 9h threshold**.

Let's check Deep work versus Shallow work:

[![Deep vs Shallow work](/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "Deep vs Shallow work")](/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "")

I decided to track my _lunch/break time_, so I can understand how much
time I'm spending on tasks that are not related to work at all
(reading emails, talking to people via Telegram, etc.). Unfortunately,
I started this too late. I have only 10 hours of lunch break so we
will have to skip it to the next month.

I have to be more descriptive with Deep work. I'm trying to keep
_Writing_ and _Read/Reply Twist_ as the same thing, maybe it will be
better next month. I'm also stunned by the small number tracked as
deep work _coding_. This month I spent far more time discussing and
writing things down than actually coding. üòï

For shallow work, we have:

+ **Meeting time** is stable (and productive), considering two 1-1
meetings (1 hour each) and four weekly meetings (around 40 minutes
each)
+ **Read/Reply Twist** is still consuming a lot of time, more than 2
hours every day.
+ **Lunch/Break** is still work in progress

Now that I'm looking into all the data, I found it interesting that
**1/3 of my time is spent communicating**. ü§î

Let's check the Twist usage by hour (previous month first, this month
after):

[![Twist usage by time of the day](/images/stats/2018/may/grescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png "Twist usage by time of the day")](/images/stats/2018/may/grescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png "")
[![Twist usage by time of the day](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png "Twist usage by time of the day")](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-twist-time-by-hour.png "")

I'm not that satisfied with this chart. The perfect chart for me would
have a small peak at 9-10, almost no usage between 10-13, a giant peak
between 14 and 16 and less usage from 16 to 21. I should have no usage
after 21.

The usage I described above is precisely the opposite of what is my
productive time. I used the [daily when
tracker](https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/time-sheet.pdf)
and found the times I'm more alert and energetic. As usual, I should
post about it as well but never do. üòï

Now, let's continue to my personal projects, last month first and this
month last:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2018/may/gtoggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2018/may/gtoggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2018/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

It's definitely better! We should consider the holiday for this month,
though. üòõ

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")
[![RescueTime pulse](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-pulse.png "RescueTime pulse")](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-pulse.png "")

My productivity pulse is better this month. [Last
month](/post/stats-may-2018/) I did some research on what happened and
found that Magic the Gathering was taking a lot of my time and also
adding some outliers, it seems to be better now.

I'm still following my Telegram usage, here is the comparison from the
previous month to the current one:

[![Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/may/grescuetime-telegram-time.png "Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/may/grescuetime-telegram-time.png "")
[![Time spend on Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-telegram-time.png "Time spent on Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-telegram-time.png "")

It seems to be better but not much. I have an alert of my time spent
using Telegram, but when it fires, it's usually too late. Working on
it.

Comparing Telegram usage by time of the day, we have (last month
first, this month second):

[![Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/may/grescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/may/grescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "")
[![Time of the day I used Telegram according to Rescuetime](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "Time of the day I used Telegram according to RescueTime")](/images/stats/2018/jun/rescuetime-telegram-time-by-hour.png "")

It improved a little bit during my peak times. I will consider that as
an improvement and keep working on it.


### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2018/jun/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2018/jun/activity.jpg "")
[![Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2018/jun/activity_comparison.jpg "Activity data comparison for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2018/jun/activity-comparison.jpg "")

This month I have **7k steps** compared to 8k from the previous month.

I'm back to the gym, but my weight is still the same. I hope to have a
big improvement next month:

[![Weight this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight.png "Weight for this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/physical-activity-weight.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/sleep.jpg "")

Better sleeping! That's good news! üôÉ


### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 8
episode this month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows.jpg "")

These episodes are related to the new season of **13 reasons why** and
__The End of the F***ing world__.

I mentioned that I'm trying [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv), and I'm
still getting used to it. This is what I'm going to use:

[![TV shows watched this month according to trakt](/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows-trakt.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to trakt")](/images/stats/2018/jun/tvshows-trakt.jpg "")

As you can see, I can also track movies. The only data that matters is
the following:

[![Trakt.tv stats this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/trakt-stats.jpg "Trakt.tv stats")](/images/stats/2018/jun/trakt-stats.jpg "")

I know I'm still missing some movies and TV shows there, hope to add
them as soon as I remember.

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I'm writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **38747** words written (**61385** last month)
+ **385** corrections made (**934** last month)
+ **11213** unique words (**16473** last month)

Grammarly is not working good inside Twist anymore, I don't know
why. I will have to reach out to Grammarly again soon.

### Locations

I've added some places to the list:

[![Places I visited](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-places.png "Places I visited")](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-places.png "")

Other than that, no new cities or countries. üòû

Let's compare the previous and this month, the previous first and
**this month right after it**:

[![General view of my locations data last month](/images/stats/2018/may/glocation-general.png "General view of my locations data last month")](/images/stats/2018/may/glocation-general.png "") .
[![General view of my locations data this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-general.png "General view of my locations data this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-general.png "")

One new city popped out, but I have no idea which one it is. Maybe it
is the lost city from the last report. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

My time commuting improved a lot this month:

[![Location time and distance last month](/images/stats/2018/may/glocation-time-distance.png "Location time and distance last month")](/images/stats/2018/may/glocation-time-distance.png "") .
[![Location time and distance this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-time-distance.png "")

Still many kilometers to "reach the moon":

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2018/jun/location-moon.png "")

### Expenses

It's time to check my expenses! üí∞

This month I spend 32% of my earnings, which is still below my
expectations (40%). This 32 % are distributed into the following
categories (in pt-BR):

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2018/jun/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2018/jun/expenses.jpg "")

We spent more with _Mercado_ (groceries) than expected (last month it
was just 3%), hope to adjust it for the next month.

As usual, I'm not considering the money in transit from my company to
my personal account (waiting for money exchange, taxes, accountant
payment, etc.).  So, without considering it, my total savings
**increased by 0.06%**. This is a good number given the current
scenario of the Brazilian economy (it's positive because I added
money, or it would be negative), and now I have **94.11%** of my goal.

### Time to write this blog post

It's an important metric to understand if it worth taking the time to
write it. So:

**It took 5 hours and 12 minutes to write it**

It's much more than I expected, but I think it's happening because I was
researching different services and also doing some research on how to
conduct my investments. Hope to decrease this time next month.


### Conclusion

It took a lot of time to write this post, and this is bad, but other
than that, the month was good in general. All my goals for this month
were met, so I have nothing to complain. ‚úå

See you next month. üññ
