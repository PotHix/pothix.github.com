Here we go again for my stats for the last month. :)

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/may/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

I will start a in a new company this month, so I decided to
re-read [Deep Work](http://amzn.to/2sNBJQs) (I really recommend this
one). This book is just great for everyone who wants to focus and do
the hard work. It has everything to do with my new work
schedule. The [book about Elon Musk](http://amzn.to/2r1nCG0) was a
good reading as well, this guy has some great ideas.

### Articles

I'm using the same export file from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
861
662
```

It means I have **861 articles Unread** and **662 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month, I got almost
**5% more unread articles**, but this time I got almost **10% more
read articles** (double of the last month's). It happened
because I took some hours to read the some articles of my Pocket
account.

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/may/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

The chart for this month is really better than last month's but still
less than what I was expecting.

Back to Ruby this month, there were some old Rails projects to work. But most of my time was spent on the Terminal, for a change.

Emacs is my main editor and there was almost no Vim this
month. But [Bash](https://github.com/irondoge/bash-wakatime) is taking
more than 40% of my time.

### Speaking

+ [Apache Mesos as a tool](https://www.eventials.com/Globalcode/quarta-a-tarde-tdconline-floripa-2017-stadium/) at [TDC Florianópolis](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2017/florianopolis/trilhas).
+ [A ruby application end to end](https://www.eventials.com/Globalcode/sabado-a-tarde-tdconline-floripa-2017-stadium/) at [TDC Florianópolis](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2017/florianopolis/trilhas).
+ Tech-talk at [Locaweb](https://locaweb.com.br). It was a Tech-talk about [TDC Florianópolis](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2017/florianopolis/trilhas). As usual, every time I go to a conference I schedule a talk to explore the content I saw there. This was no different. :)
+ [Deconstructing the web](http://cege.la/OSc9Yb) at BioRitmo tech-talks.

Here is my current status of presentations this month:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/may/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/may/presentations.png "")

I'm on-track again! :)

### Podcasts

Here is
my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/may/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/may/podcasts.jpg)

I was the equivalent to **3 days and 9 hours** of podcast time (I tend
to speed up all my podcasts, so I don't know how much time it took for
real). It's **almost 15 hours more** than April.

I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/may/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/may/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just for the record, this is an "all time list". :)

### Hours working

Here are my data from my time tracking
software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/may/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/may/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. There is
another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/may/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/may/toggl-time-working.png "")

My data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) is better than last month but not good enough yet:

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/may/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/may/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

Maybe next month I will reach the target.

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/may/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/may/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
**8.3k** steps (260/31).

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/may/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/may/physical-activity-steps.png "")

The peak was in a nice Sunday when I met some friends to chit-chat in a local park. It was just 3 of us talking and walking around the park.

My max distance was **12.7km** walking in that same Sunday:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/may/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/may/physical-activity-distance.png "")

I lost some kg this month. This is a good sign, I think.

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/may/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/may/physical-activity-weight.png "")

This month I slept less but with more deep sleep:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/may/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/may/sleep.jpg "")

I think this is a good sign as well. I want to sleep better, not sleep
more.

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 39 episodes this month.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/may/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/may/tvshows.jpg "")

More than 18 of them is still part of our (my wife and me) **How I
met your mother** marathon. The other episodes are a combination of **Better call saul**, **13 reasons why**, and **Sense 8**.

I spent almost 1 day of my life watching TV Series this month.

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately, they only send weekly emails, I don't know if I will keep these metrics because it take some time to build it.

Anyways, here are my stats for this month:

+ **26914** words written
+ **243** corrections made
+ **11478** unique words

I decided to remove my "common mistakes" from this report because the
data seems to be not reliable.

### Locations

This month I visited 18 new places (the last month were **338 places**) and 1 new city:

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/may/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/may/location-general.png "")

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/may/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/may/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represent only 47% of net income**, the rest is being
invested. Just like last month, this was atypical as well. Last month
I received the money related to my freelance work on January and March
and now I had to pay the taxes related to it.

This month increased my total savings by **1%**.
I have **68.83%** of my goal.

### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.

I'm spending almost no time to collect the data, most part of it is
automatic. The services that require manual interaction are already
part of my day-to-day life, so I'm not tracking it.

**It took 2 hours and 30 minutes to write this post**

### Conclusion

This month was better than the last one. It was not so good as I
expected because I had to do some exams to be sure I'm OK and I was
also changing jobs. I was working for the same company for the last 7
years and decide to try something else, but this is a subject for a
different post. ;)

I got two weeks to "relax" (cof... work on some personal
projects... cof), so I don't know exactly how the next month will
be. Let's wait for the next post! :)
