After build the [Iris keyboard](/iris) I decided to start a new quest to build
a Dactyl-cc (as I mentioned at the end of the Iris post üòâ)

Dactyl is the keyboad I wanted to build from the start but I certainly didn't
have the skils to do it. I decided to first build a "portable kinesis", so I
could take it with me when I was traveling and Iris seemed like a great fit for
this and not that hard for a first project. Now that I have the skills, I will
build the Dactyl to maybe take my kinesis' place.

## Parts to buy

I decided to buy everything from AliExpress. It's usually cheaper than buying
everything where I like (Brazil) and I not in a hurry, which is the bigger
disadvantage of AliExpress.

Many of these parts I could easily find in a local store, sometimes even
cheaper, but due to the pandemic I don't want to visit any physical store.

With that said, let's go for the list of parts I bought and the individual
links (the advantage of buying everything on AliExpress ‚ò∫Ô∏è):
