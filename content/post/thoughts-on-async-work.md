title: "Thoughts on Async Work"

As I'm having some "safe commuting" (places where I can open my laptop
without being too afraid of being robbed) time during my trip to
Portugal, I'm trying to write down things I have in my mind currently.

As I said many time in the previous posts, [I'm working for
Doist](/post/doist-pothix) and we work asynchronously there. I was
writing my thoughts without much explanation but then I found out that
it would not make any sense if I don't give you enough context about
that, so I'm structuring it a little bit.

## What is async work

Async work is when you not expect an immediate answer from someone
when you ask a question. It's acceptable to receive an answer in
around 12 hours.

## Why async work?

After reading the previous section you would ask yourself: "Why!? I
just want to fix something and that person knows the answer! It's
unproductive to wait for 12 hours!". I know how it fells because I
worked in synchronously as a programmer for more than 10 years and I also
have close friends working on companies with totally different ways of
work.

When you focus on async work, you can better prepare your schedule and
take bigger chunks of your time to work on things that require
focus. Interruptions are very disrupting for many
professions. Sometimes it takes a lot of time to create enough context
to solve a problem and an interruption will require a context switch, which is very frustrating.

By following this way of work, it doesn't make much sense to send a
message like "Hey [person], do you have some minutes?" because the
answer may come when you peer reach his/her chunk of shallow work time
(email, twist, small fixes, etc.). For this reason, it's encouraged
that you write a full message like: _"Hey Gandalf, I need some help
here with this particular code. I'm doing X but for some reason, Y is
not happening. There's a branch called `wizards` in the codebase, can
you please see if you know what magic has to be done there?"._

## Isn't it hard for the project manager to follow up?

We don't have a person with the project manager role. We currently
have "squad leaders" who will lead the squad for a particular
project. It's the role of the squad leader to create a schedule about
the current project for the next month (we are currently doing 1 month
iterations) and talk to the parts that should be involved to complete
it.

The product team will keep an eye on the planning document just to be
sure it **looks** feasible and we are not having several projects that
heavily depend on the same team at the same time.

## And finally... the situation I want to discuss

We (Doist) just had our yearly retreat in AÃ§ores, Portugal. People
usually take some time to off for vacations as they are already far
from home and some of them decided to work some days from Porto. We
have a small office in Porto as we have around 10 people working from
Portugal.

I was reading our [Twist](https://twist.com) while I was still waiting
my wife for my vacations and I just the following discussion:

* [support team] Hey, we found the problem X here.
* [supporter working from Porto] Hey, I'm here in the office and I
  just grabbed our lead developer to talk about it and we found the
  root cause.
* [lead developer] Yes, found the root cause and fixed it.

If you're working from an office you probably see this every day. When
working remotely and asynchronously we usually don't have this "let me
stand up and reach out to person X to fix the problem" attitude
because we trust our peers to manage their priorities and not disrupt
their focus (unless it's important and urgent, of course).

As I'm on vacations now, I had some time give some thought to this
situation. Some interesting points:

+ **The issue was solved faster than it would be using usual
  flow**. What we usually do is to create a thread to start the
  discussion about it and the developers will jump in as soon as their
  time reserved for issues come. We usually reserve a portion of our
  time for that because it's an important part of the work.
+ **Is it the right thing to do at this particular moment?**. I'm on
  vacations and I don't have the full context (and it doesn't matter
  much for this particular reflection), but I'm actually unsure about
  how high is the priority for this issue. When we are together in the
  same location we don't consider the cost of disrupting someone's
  work to fix our current problem. I know someone may use the argument
  that "it's not _my_ problem, it's the company's probem", but keep in
  mind that all problems are company's problems and some may have
  higher priority.
+ **Should our lead be working on it?**. Our lead is the busiest guy
  of the team nowadays, especially because he is the one who is
  working for the company for many years and know the legacy codebase
  better. He also has some tasks that are not just coding, so we try
  to offload the work for him whenever possible.


# Conclusion?

As I said, I have no idea what was the context of this particular
issue. It's possible that it was really urgent, or our lead had some
time to spare while drinking some coffee and just found a quick
solution, or whatever other "not a big deal" situation. The point of
this post is to think about the trade-offs of remote/async work.

At Doist we believe that having time to do focused work is worth the
time of being "disconnected" from your team. Most of the time, issues
can wait hours to be solved, especially when you have developers in
multiple timezones.

There's not really a conclusion here but I would like to write down my
thoughts here so I can use in future arguments about the topic.

I hope the context on this post will allow me to write shorter posts
next time. :)
