I'm ready to review my stats for June and share them with you! Are
you? Hope so! :D

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")


Last month I read [Deep Work](http://amzn.to/2sNBJQs) again because I
was preparing to work for a new company. The new company
is [Doist](https://doist.com), but this is a topic for a new post. It
proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From
their reading list I also
took [The score takes care of itself](http://amzn.to/2ubyLXo)
and [Start with Why](http://amzn.to/2syNucX). Both are great books on
how to think your products and leadership, highly recommended!

Before joining I read [The secrets of story](http://amzn.to/2sz4oIx),
a great book on how to write novels and keep your reader turning
pages. There are many great tips here, I really recommend if you want
to write something someday.

The other one is [Louder than words](http://amzn.to/2tBTV42). It's all
about how we deal with meaning. It was interesting to think about
meaning as a concept beyond words, for computer scientists, think
about words as being pointers to a meaning. :)

That's it, 4 books in a month, I'm proud of myself :P


### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
968
708
```

It means I have **968 articles Unread** and **708 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (861 unread and
662 read), I got around **11% more unread articles** and only **6.5%
more read articles**. 

It was a lot more unread articles and not so much read ones. I will
have to work on it again.

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Looks like my coding productivity is back to normal. Hope to improve
my deep working this month.

Much of what I did was related to improve static pages and
documentation projects, so I have a lot of `bash` and `Markdown` as
most used languages.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jun/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Editors are pretty much the same as last month's.

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jun/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

### Speaking

+ [HTML5 Game development](https://www.eventials.com/Globalcode/quarta-a-tarde-tdconline-floripa-2017-stadium) at [Impacta Tecnologia](www.impacta.com.br).
+ [Guru-SP representation on a panel discussing communities](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDarqhkW0AAuuJT.jpg:large) at [19o Encontro Locaweb](http://eventos.locaweb.com.br/eventos-anteriores/19o-encontro-locaweb-sao-paulo/).

Here is my current status of presentations this month:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/jun/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/jun/presentations.png "")

A good progress this month and I have three more scheduled for next month. Go go go!

### Podcasts

Here is
my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg)

It was the equivalent to **1 day and 23 hours** of podcast time. It's
a lot less than last month, but that's common, I listened to many
audiobooks instead.

I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just for the record, this is an "all time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen
to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here are the data from my time tracking
software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. It's less
than what I'm used to see but it's OK since I left my previous job and
took some days "off" (not exactly off, but that's it).

There is another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png "")

Almost **4x more than April**. :D

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

For the first time (I think...) I reached my goal! New job + deep work FTW.

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
**10.6k** steps (318/30), more than next month (8.3k) \o/.

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **11.7km**:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png "")

My weight is almost the same:

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png "")

This month I slept less but with more deep sleep:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg "")

Less average sleeping and less deep sleeping for this month. It's not
so much (around 10min avg for both), but I should keep an eye on it.

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 35 episodes this month.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg "")

It's a combination of **Better call saul**, two seasons of **Sense
8**, and **Mr. Robot** (finally! :D).

It's a bit confusing to calculate how many days I spent on TV shows
this month, but I now reached the mark of 1 month of time spend
watching TV. =/

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately, they only send weekly emails, I don't know if I will keep these metrics because it take some time to build it.

Anyways, here are my stats for this month:

+ **26914** words written
+ **243** corrections made
+ **11478** unique words

I decided to remove my "common mistakes" from this report because the
data seems to be not reliable.

### Locations

This month I visited 18 new places (the last month were **338 places**) and 1 new city:

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png "")

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represent only 47% of net income**, the rest is being
invested. Just like last month, this was atypical as well. Last month
I received the money related to my freelance work on January and March
and now I had to pay the taxes related to it.

This month increased my total savings by **1%**.
I have **68.83%** of my goal.

### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.

I'm spending almost no time to collect the data, most part of it is
automatic. The services that require manual interaction are already
part of my day-to-day life, so I'm not tracking it.

**It took 2 hours and 30 minutes to write this post**

### Conclusion

This month was better than the last one. It was not so good as I
expected because I had to do some exams to be sure I'm OK and I was
also changing jobs. I was working for the same company for the last 7
years and decide to try something else, but this is a subject for a
different post. ;)

I got two weeks to "relax" (cof... work on some personal
projects... cof), so I don't know exactly how the next month will
be. Let's wait for the next post! :)
