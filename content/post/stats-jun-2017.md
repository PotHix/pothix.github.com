I'm ready to review my stats for June and share them with you! Are
you? Hope so! :D

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

Last month I read [Deep Work](http://amzn.to/2sNBJQs) again because I
was preparing to work for a new company. The new company
is [Doist](https://doist.com), but this is a topic for a another post. It
proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From
their reading list I also
took [The score takes care of itself](http://amzn.to/2ubyLXo)
and [Start with Why](http://amzn.to/2syNucX). Both are great books on
how to think your products and leadership, highly recommended!

Before joining I read [The secrets of story](http://amzn.to/2sz4oIx),
a great book on how to write novels and keep your reader turning
pages. There are many great tips there, I really recommend if you want
to write a novel someday.

The other one is [Louder than words](http://amzn.to/2tBTV42). It's all
about how we deal with meaning. It was interesting to think about
meaning as a concept beyond words, for computer scientists, think
about words as being pointers to a meaning. :)

That's it, 4 books in a month, I'm proud of myself :P


### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
968
708
```

It means I have **968 articles Unread** and **708 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (861 unread and
662 read), I got around **11% more unread articles** and only **6.5%
more read articles**. 

It was a lot more unread articles and not so much read ones. I will
have to work on it again.

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Looks like my coding productivity is back to normal. Hope to improve
my deep working this month.

Much of what I did was related to improve static pages and
documentation projects, so I have a lot of `bash` and `Markdown` as
most used languages.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jun/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Editors are pretty much the same as last month's.

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jun/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

### Speaking

+ [HTML5 Game development](https://www.eventials.com/Globalcode/quarta-a-tarde-tdconline-floripa-2017-stadium) at [Impacta Tecnologia](www.impacta.com.br).
+ [Guru-SP representation on a panel discussing communities](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDarqhkW0AAuuJT.jpg:large) at [19o Encontro Locaweb](http://eventos.locaweb.com.br/eventos-anteriores/19o-encontro-locaweb-sao-paulo/).

Here is the current status of my goal for presentations this month:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/jun/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/jun/presentations.png "")

A good progress this month and I have three more scheduled for next month. Go go go!

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcasts.jpg)

**1 day and 23 hours** of podcast time. It's a lot less than last
month, but that's common as I listened to many audiobooks instead.

I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/jun/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just for the record, this is an "all time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here are the data from my time tracking software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. It's less
than what I'm used to see but it's OK since I left my previous job and
took some days "off" (not exactly off, but that's it).

There is another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jun/toggl-time-working.png "")

Almost **4x more than April**. :D

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/jun/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

For the first time (I think...) I reached my goal! New job + deep work FTW.

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/jun/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
**10.6k** steps (318/30), a lot more than next month (it was **8.3k**) \o/.

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **11.7km**:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-distance.png "")

My weight is almost the same:

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/physical-activity-weight.png "")

My sleep data:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/sleep.jpg "")

Less average sleeping and less deep sleeping for this month. It's not
so much (around 10min avg for both), but I should keep an eye on it.

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 35 episodes this month.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/jun/tvshows.jpg "")

It's a combination of **Better call saul**, two seasons of **Sense
8**, and **Mr. Robot** (finally! :D).

It's a bit confusing to calculate how many days I spent on TV shows
this month, but I now reached the mark of 1 month of time spent (or
wasted, pick your side) watching TV. =/

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **34156** words written (**26914** last month)
+ **634** corrections made (**243** last month)
+ **10332** unique words (**11478** last month)

More than 8k words written compared to last month but also almost 3x more corrections made :(.
Unique words are less than next month but not so much.

### Locations

For some reason 1 country and 1 city is gone from my timeline, maybe I
did some cleanup but didn't remember. In the other hand, the amount of
places I visited increased by **55**! I'm not sure why that happened,
since I did not traveled this month. It was probably some cleanup made
by Google Maps folks.

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/jun/location-general.png "")

I also decided to add the amount of time spent in a vehicle this month:

[![Location time and distance](/images/stats/2017/jun/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance")](/images/stats/2017/jun/location-time-distance.png "")

9 hours in the whole month! In contrast, I walked 111km, which is
probably part of my daily dog walking / Gym routine. **Remote work
FTW**!

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/jun/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents a small portion of 17% of net income**, the
rest is being invested. Yeah, but again this was atypical month. I
know it's being repetitive already but as I'm changing jobs, I
received some money related to Brazilian work law stuff (yeah, it's
complicated) and almost everything was invested. Part of this money
will be used in the next month, because I will not be able to generate
invoices yet, thanks to the very slow Brazilian processes to have your
own company.

I had to change my portfolio because of this changes in my
professional life and also because of the current state of economics
and politics in Brazil.

This month I increased my total savings by **5.2%** and reached
**72.46%** of my goal.

### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.

**It took 4 hours and 03 minutes to write this post**

Almost the double comparing to last month. As I had to change a lot of
things on my investment portfolio, it took some time to organize
everything again.


### Conclusion

I feel great this month. :)

The new job is amazing and I can focus on my deep working routine to
actually do real stuff. I'm still getting used to the new workflow and
software I have to support, but it's being an awesome experience.

Hope to have more good news next month.
