Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel
again this month. Let's see if it affected my performance.

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft,
called [At the mountains of madness](http://amzn.to/2AO5IPW) was one
of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read
about [minimalism](http://amzn.to/2nqZG2h) just to realize that I'm a
minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to
listen to their [podcast](https://www.theminimalists.com/podcast/) and
read their website.

The last book is [On power](http://amzn.to/2Ath5tX) which was probably
the worst book this year. It was so small that I could finish but I
can't say that I learned a lot from it.

I also started
reading [The Rust Programming language](http://amzn.to/2nrzm8p)
because I'm playing with Rust a little bit. I still want to
finish [Elixir in Action](http://amzn.to/2ztCDZU) but it will take a
while.

### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1255
931
```

It means I have **1255 articles Unread** and **931 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (**1230 unread**
and **905 read**), I got around **1.7% more unread articles** and **1%
more read articles**.

Almost the same growth of the last month. For me, it means that it was
a good thing to check my Feedly once a week but that doesn't change
the number of articles I read and it's probably the new delicious.

### Coding

Here are the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

The empty days are related to a holiday in Brazil and a huge amount of technical tickets and support for our APIs during that week. It was the price for the focused work in the week before. :)

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

`markdown` is usually the most used language because I write long texts in emacs before posting on [Twist](https://twistapp.com). I removed the `bash` plugin from my terminal in the middle of the month so that 38% doesn't make much sense. And then... **Rust**! It was a fun week.

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Nothing new here. Emacs at the top, bash being removed and Vim.

### Speaking

+ **Desconstruindo a web** at [Codus](http://www.codus.com.br/) tech-talks
+ **Desconstruindo a web - Sua app ruby end to end** at [TOTVS Tech day](http://www.totvstechday.io/)

Here is the chart comparing to my goal for this year:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png "")

My first goal was to speak 19 times with 1 international talk and I
reached. After reaching the first goal I set a new goal: reach **25
talks this year** and I just met it. Speak 25 times in one year is
more than I could have ever imagined. Now it's time to take a break
and enjoy the last month of the year. :)

### Completed tasks

This is the number of tasks completed on [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/tasks-completed.png)

**404 tasks** completed this month (**17 more** than last month).

This time I have some other colors on the chart. It's related to
internal Todoist projects but most part of it is still personal (red)
and work-related (blue).

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcasts.jpg)

**2 days and 13 hours** of podcast time, just 4 hours more than last month. It means that I spent a lot of time listening to Podcasts again. 

As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just remember that this is an "all-time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of the episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here is the data from my time tracking software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and the full-time job. Not so much time as a freelancer, though. I decided to do a deep down about the time I spent working for my full-time employee this month:

[![Hours working for at Doist](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-doist.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-doist.png "")

We had 20 work days in Brazil this month and I worked for 189 hours, which mean that **I worked 30 hours more than I should**. According to this data, almost 5 of those hours were on the weekends/holidays. I should really improve that.

[![Deep vs Shallow work](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "Deep vs Shallow work")](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "")

What I can take from this chart:

* Meetings are stable. I usually have around 4-5 hours of meetings a month. One useful weekly meeting of around 40 min and one 1-1 meeting. If necessary I have small meetings to fix certain problems.
* Hiring is taking some time. Interviewing, looking for candidates and writing down my opinions take some time
* Shallow work is still consuming around 65% of my tasks. I'm trying to describe the tasks better so I can understand what I'm considering shallow work. Maybe I will have something next month.

There is another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/dec/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

It is related to my two talks and my participation in the [hangout by Farol Digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXu-kJE_H4). I'm still not producing a lot of content but it's an improvement.

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

I changed my browser for [Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/)
but forgot to install the rescuetime extension, so I don't have enough detailed
data. It will be the same (or worst) for the next month.

Here are the big offenders:

[![Offesors of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png "Offenders of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/dec/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png "")

I just changed Twist to `productive` instead of `distracting`. I'm not
sure if Twist deserves to be distracting because we usually talk about
work there and it's not so distracting. With that said, Twist still
takes a big portion of my time due to the need for communication. It's
the source of all conversations at Doist, but it's up to us to not
make communication overwhelming. I'm still working to have the balance
between communication and "real work", let's see how it goes.


### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
**6.3k** steps (190625/30). It was kinda disappointing as it's below my
average. I will work on it for the next month. :)

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **8.4km** walking in one day:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg "")

Some more minutes of average sleeping (**7h31m** for the last month)
but also less deep sleeping (last month was **1h58**) 😢

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 36
episodes this month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "")

This month we finished **Orphan Black (season 4 and 5)** and started **Billions**.

I spent **1 day and 3 hours** of my life watching TV shows this month.


### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I'm writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **71062** words written (in September it was **73969**)
+ **1091** corrections made (in September it was **1826**)
+ **17429** unique words (in September it was **17139**)

I'm comparing to September because October was not a typical month. I had fewer words written but I can see that I had fewer corrections made and more unique words! That makes me feel good. 😁

### Locations

At the end of the month, I went to York (the old York, in England, not the New York, in the USA) to work from there for 1 month. So, a new country was added:

[![New countries](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png "New countries")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-countries.png "")

I think it was actually part of the list from when I visited London but it's worth posting. The city of York was also added:

[![New cities](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png "New cities")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-cities.png "")

So, in summary:

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png "")

One new city and 16 new places.

Not so useful, but here is the time spent on vehicles:

[![Location time and distance](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-time-distance.png "")

It's probably the time spent in the taxi to the airport and in the bus from Manchester to Leeds and York.

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-moon.png "")

This trip removed 11k km from my distance to the moon. 👍

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this month**. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described [in](/post/stats-jul-2017) [the](/post/stats-jun-2017/) [last](/post/stats-aug-2017) [five](/post/stats-sep-2017) [months](/post/stats-oct-2017) still
persists, for this reason, there's no money coming yet. :(

This month I finally had some good news and the process is almost done, just waiting for the final document. Hope to have something to show next month.

And again... If you're reading this every month, you already know that
my wife is paying all of our bills until my situation gets back to
normal and I'm really glad to have someone to rely on when things like
these happen. ❤

This month is back to normal and my wife helped to keep our expenses
in a good shape. My total savings **increased by 0.6%** and now I have
**73.70%** of my goal.


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric

**It took 3 hours and 30 minutes to write this post**


### Conclusion

Just came back from a trip last month to prepare to travel again this
month. I'm writing this post from the winter
of [York](https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982), it's -1 Celsius but feels
like -7. I worked a lot this month but it enabled me to keep my
work on schedule for the travel so I think it worth it.

I did not receive any money yet but everything is moving forward
now and I hope to have a nice December with everything set up. :)
