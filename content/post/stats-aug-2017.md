September is here, time to review my stats for August, 2017.

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

This is my personal record of books read in one single month. 7 freaking
books. 😱

Let's start with two small books I
read. [Cesar Millan's Guide to Audiobooks for Dogs](http://amzn.to/2iOU0wT)
and
[Cesar Millan's Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog](http://amzn.to/2wYH8ub). These
two books were free on [Audible for Dogs](https://audible.com/dogs), so I
decided to give them a try. They are ordinary books but I would recommend for
dog lovers. :)

[Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity](http://amzn.to/2wqE094) is
one of the best books I read on leadership. There's no magic here, just deal
with people in the right way. Give sincere feedback, expect sincere feedback,
understand their career paths and let them go if the job is not good for them
(and vice-versa). I recommend every boss to read it. Seriously.

[Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box](http://amzn.to/2wZ13sQ)
is a book that helps you to think about your attitude before judging people. Not
amazing, but it's a good one.

[The Destroyer of Worlds](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2105449169) was
a recommendation from [Amir](https://twitter.com/amix3k) and until now none of
his recommendations disappointed, so I decided to try it. The content is really
amazing! A lot of context about the political and moral problems of the atomic
bombs. I really recommend to listen to it if you like the subject. The
descriptions of the Japanese of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are really hard to listen
though. It's not a book, but you will consider that as a book as soon as you
listen to it.

[My Favorite Universe](http://amzn.to/2eqFrus) is a great book to introduce
people to science. Neil deGrasse Tyson has the ability to show complicated stuff
in an uncomplicated way. The example of density with the cream on his hot
chocolate is really nice.

[Rendezvous with Rama](http://amzn.to/2wqJhx8) is one of those books I was not
expecting to like but turns out to be one of the best books I read in the
genre. The way Arthur C. Clarke describes Rama and how everything works there is
really amazing. Totally recommended.


### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1157
883
```

It means I have **1157 articles Unread** and **883 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (1044 unread and
777 read), I got around **10% more unread articles** and **12%
more read articles**.

It increased the percentages of read and unread because it took some time to
generate the numbers. Anyways, the problem persists, I usually don't read the
articles I mark to read. Looks like Pocket is my new app for bookmarks... Yay! :(

I'm using it to mark all the articles I read throughout the month, so it's not
that useless but I will have to reconsider the idea of reading all articles I
have there. Maybe start producing instead of consuming, which is one trend I've
been seeing a lot nowadays.

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

As usual, it's kind of the average with one outlier. This average of 3-4 hours
coding always bugs me.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/aug/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I don't know why `markdown` always takes the lead (after `bash`), but `Python` is coming as it should.

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/aug/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Nothing new to editors. I still use Vim, but Emacs is the leader by far.

### Speaking

+ [Desconstruindo a web: Entendendo uma requisição](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136449291@N08/36751193061/in/album-72157684637490782/) at [Interdevops](https://interdevops.com.br)
+ **Uma requisição web do começo ao fim** at **Tech-hour Catho**.

This was an ordinary month regarding presentations, but still following what I
had defined for my goal:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/aug/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/aug/presentations.png "")

The goal was reached this month! I will try to keep the same rhythm and maybe
speak in different countries. :)

### Completed tasks

This is the amount of tasks completed on [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/tasks-completed.png)

**534 tasks** completed this month (**20 less** than last month).

I still have plans to create a better way to extract data from my Todoist
account, just need some spare time. Not so easy these days.

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/podcasts.jpg)

**1 day and 16 hours** of podcast time, almost 1 day less than last month. This
is a trend I've been following, when I read (or listen to) more books I consume
less podcasts. :)

I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/aug/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/aug/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just remember that this is an "all time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here is the data from my time tracking software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. It's really hard to
work as a freelancer now, my full-time job is taking all my energy, so most part
of it is dedicated to it.

Here is the difference between shallow and deep work regarding my full-time job:

[![Deep vs Shallow work](/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "Deep vs Shallow work")](/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "")

It was less deep work than last month (13 hours less) but it's good to know I'm
still spending around 1/3 of my time in Deep Work state. I'm also tracking time
in meetings, it was almost one day in meetings this month. I did not track every
single meeting because it would be too much work, but it was basically related
to:

+ 1-1 meeting
+ Weekly status (30 min each)
+ Meeting with other members of the team
+ Useful meetings with other teams and thirty parties

I hate useless meetings but all of these were useful and needed. :)

There is another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/aug/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

Even less than last month, it makes me sad :(.

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

It's sad but I missed my goal for this month. Looks like it was pretty close (99%):

[![Details of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-detail.png "Details of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-detail.png "")

BTW, my goal is 3h using only productive apps, the idea is to improve the usage
of these. Here are the big offensors:

[![Offesors of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png "Offensors of my goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/aug/rescuetime-productivetime-offensors.png "")

Yeah, communication and Scheduling. I really want to spend less time
in [Twist](https://twistapp.com). It's the source of all conversations at Doist,
but it's up to us to not make communication overwhelming. I'm still working to
have the balance between comunication and real work. Time to improve this. :)

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/aug/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/aug/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of **6.6k**
steps (207/31). It was almost 50k less steps than last month. I was not feeling
good some days so I had to skip the gym, maybe this is the cause of that.

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **9.2km**:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-distance.png "")

My weight is stable:

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight.png "")

And here is some data on my current weight:

[![Data on my weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight-data.jpg "Data on my weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/physical-activity-weight-data.jpg "")

MiFit app interface for sleep data changed a little bit but here is my data for
this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep.jpg "")

A bit more average sleeping (**7h32m** for the last month) and more deep
sleeping for this month \o/ (last month was **1h32**). It's probably not related
(at least not in particular) to the change of bands (Mi band -> Mi band 2),
because I'm using it for two months now and my deep sleeping improved for the
second month.

Here is my stats comparing to the whole Mi band user base:

[![Stats about my sleep data](/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep_stats.jpg "Stats about my sleep data")](/images/stats/2017/aug/sleep_stats.jpg "")

Not so good, I think. 😅


### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 24 episodes this month.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/aug/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/aug/tvshows.jpg "")

It's a combination of **Westworld** (recommended, BTW), **The defenders**, **The
crown**, and **Game of Thrones**.

Note that I had some delay to get this screenshot and there are some numbers from
September already (blue arrow). With that said, I think I spent around **24
hours** watching TV this month.

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

My stats for this month:

+ **69493** words written (**51018** last month)
+ **1881** corrections made (**1272** last month)
+ **13925** unique words (**10332** last month)

The numbers keep rising because all of my work conversations are in English,
that's nice. I had **more than 20% more words written** , around **30% more unique
words**, but also **more than 34% more corrections made**.

### Locations

This time I have one additional city in the list because I traveled to bebedouro
to speak at [interdevops](https://interdevops.com.br). It also helped to
increase the list of places visited by **9**.

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/aug/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/aug/location-general.png "")

Here is the time spend in vehicles:

[![Location time and distance](/images/stats/2017/aug/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance")](/images/stats/2017/aug/location-time-distance.png "")

I know I spent 9 hours traveling to speak at interdevops and 3 hours to speak at Catho, so 12 from these 14 hours are related to my presentations. Pretty good. Just want to say it again: **Remote work FTW**!

And as always, the funny metric:

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2017/aug/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2017/aug/location-moon.png "")

Hope to reach the moon some day.

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/aug/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/aug/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this month**. The number is not wrong,
I did not receive any money this
month. [The problem I described last month](/post/stats-jul-2017) and
the [month before it](/post/stats-jun-2017/) is not solved yet, for this reason,
there's no money coming yet. :(

My expenses are normal again but I'm not paying anything, my wife is paying all
of our bills until my situation gets back to normal. I'm kinda stressed with
this situation but it's great to have someone to rely on when things like these
happen. ❤️

Well, thanks to the volatile economy in Brazil, my total savings increased by
**1.9%** and I did not add any money to it (because I'm not receiving
anything...). Now I reached **74.23%** of my goal.


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.

**It took 3 hours and 52 minutes to write this post**

1 hour more than last month, I need to improve it for next month.


### Conclusion

Excluding the fact of not being able to receive my payment because of
bureaucracy that has nothing to do with what I do, this month was good. I'm
integrated to the team and getting used to the code and the team way of work.

It's really nice to work on products you love and also see people using it and
giving nice feedback. I was missing that for a long time. :)

The next step is try to improve my productivity for the next month. Let's see
how it goes.
