This is the first post of a series that will show all the data I've been collecting during the month. One of my goals this year is to track everything possible. These posts will help me to analyze all the data and may extract something for me.

This is not a new idea, I'm inspired
by
[posts like this](https://www.truevalhalla.com/blog/online-income-report-057-january-2017) from
[Matthew of truevalhalla.com](https://www.truevalhalla.com/about).

### Books

My goal is to **read 30 books this year**, so I must have an average
of 2.5 books per month. I read two this month:

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

Both books were "read" by using audiobooks from [Audible](https://audible.com).

### Coding

To track my time coding I'm
using [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix) (this link is a
referral, use it in case you want to try it out).

By using it I can see the amount of hours I spent programming:

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Don't worry about the colors in this chart, each project has it's own color but it's not relevant for this case. My best best day was Jan 19th, almost 12h coding.

Now we can check the languages I'm using:

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I have no idea what this "Other" means. The purple one
is [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/). I'm playing with it and it's
great.

Here is the controversial fact. My text editors:

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Forget about Chrome, I was testing a feature from Wakatime. But yes,
I'm using both Vim and Emacs. :P

### Speaking

I spoke three times this month, here is the list and descriptions:

+ [Campus Code](https://campuscode.com.br/), it was opening the _Quero
  ser dev_ program. I was talking about the chooses we made as
  developers during our careers.
+ [Impacta](http://www.impacta.com.br), speaking about what what
  happens behind a web request. This is the presentation that
  inspired [my book](https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br).
+ [Campus Code](https://campuscode.com.br/), after 6+ rehearsals I was
  trying my talk "Open source behind a web request" for an actual
  audience. It was my first talk in English.

### Podcasts

I'm a big fan of audio programs. I have many audiobooks and podcasts in my collection and I listen to them whenever possible.

This is my stats for this month, thanks to [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en):

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png)

The big numbers is my total time, but look at the "January 2017" time.

### Hours working

I'm testing [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to track my working hours. This
is the first month and here are the results:

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png "")

I'm also using [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) to
track my apps on my cellphone and personal computer. It still needs
some tuning but here are my goal of 3 productive hours per day:

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

I will work on that.

### Physical activity

I try to keep a regular physical activity. After buying a simple and cheap [Mi band](http://www.mi.com/en/miband/) I can track it better. It's integrated with [Google Fit](https://fit.google.com), so I can extract all those nice charts.

This is the amount of steps this month:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png "")

Distance by day:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png "")

And I'm also tracking my weight, which is improving! :)

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png "")

By using miband, I can also track the amount of sleep for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/sleep.jpg "")

Unfortunately this app does not know how to deal with sleep time when
you sleep after midnight. This is the main reason why it says I'm
going to sleep at 07:20 and I'm waking up 07:18 (???). I will
workaround this bug by avoiding to sleep after midnight, as I'm waking up
around 6. :P

### TV Shows

I don't watch so much TV but it's a hobby of mine (and my wife) to
watch TV Shows on Netflix. We also watch Game of thrones on HBO when available.

I'm using [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) to track it and here is my stats for this month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg "")

### Expenses

This is something I'm planning to do for a long time now but never got
the chance. I always keep track of my expenses and now I decided to
publish here as well. It will not have values (because it don't need
to), but here is the chart for my expenses by category:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/expenses.jpg "")

Yeah, I know, all categories in pt-BR. This chart comes from a
Brazilian app called [GuiaBolso](https://www.guiabolso.com.br/) and
it's the best I have for the moment. As you may expect, it takes a lot
of time to collect all these data, so I will keep it as is for a
while.

Most part of my expenses was covering the travel expenses for my
Eurotrip next of February.

### Conclusion

This is the first post, so there are many details missing. The idea is
to start "simple" and keep improving in the next months. As it's not
so easy to write posts like these, I'm trying to create some
"templates" for it.

It was a pretty good experience to see all that data together. :)

Let's see how it goes in the next months.
