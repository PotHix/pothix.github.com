This is the first post of a series that will show what I've been doing
this year with most data as possible. I'm inspired
by
[posts like this](https://www.truevalhalla.com/blog/online-income-report-057-january-2017) from
[Matthew of truevalhalla.com](https://www.truevalhalla.com/about).

I will start it simple and increment it in the next months if possible.
 
### Books

My goal is to read 30 books this year, so I have to have an average of
2.5 books per month. I got two for this month:

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

Both books were "read" by using audiobooks from [Audible](https://audible.com).

### Coding

Here are my  stats on [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix). First the amount of hours I spent programming:

The languages I'm using:

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

The purple one is [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/). I'm playing with it and it's really great.

And the editors:

Forget about Chrome, I was testing a feature from Wakatime. :P

### Podcasts

I'm a big fan of audio programs. I have many audiobooks and podcasts in my collection and I listen to them whenever possible.

This is my stats for this month:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png)

### Physical activity

I try to keep a regular physical activity. After buying a simple and cheap [Mi band](http://www.mi.com/en/miband/) I can track it better. It's integrated with Google Fit, so I can extract all those nice charts.

This is the amount of steps this month:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png "")

The distance by day:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png "")

And I'm also tracking my weight, which is improving! :)

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png "")

### Hours working

I'm trying [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to track my working hours. This is the first month and here are the results:

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png "")

But I'm also using [RescueTime](https://rescuetime.com) to track what I'm doing on my cellphone and personal computer. It still needs some tuning but here are the stats:
