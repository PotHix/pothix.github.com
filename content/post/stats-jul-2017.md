Okay, here we go for the first full month working in my new job. :)

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

This month I read
[Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman](http://amzn.to/2hrZ7Cu),
which was recommended by the other [Doisters](https://doist.com). It's a great
book by the guy who built the company [Patagonia](www.patagonia.com), a
bootstrapped company, from scratch. Their way of thinking looks a lot like the
way we think at Doist.

The second one is
[Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better](http://amzn.to/2v2fElh). I
bought this book on Audible daily deal and it surprised me in a good way. It was
made for teachers in the beginning but was changed for the general public. You
can still feel the education background but it is not a bad thing for me. I
found some good strategies my teachers used on me when I was on college.

The 7th season of Game of Thrones just started and I decided to
read
[A Game of Thrones, the fist book of A Song of Ice and Fire](http://amzn.to/2v1YcgJ). After
reading it I found the 1st season to be really loyal to the books, which is
really nice. If you, like me, enjoys the TV show a lot, I really recommend
reading. There are some background and feelings you understand better when
reading the books. I hope to start the next one soon.


### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1044
777
```

It means I have **1044 articles Unread** and **777 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (968 unread and
708 read), I got around **8% more unread articles** and **9%
more read articles**.

It improved a little bit compared to last month but the unread count is still
growing which means I will probably never read many of those articles. =/

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Nothing new here. I have one big peak of almost 7 hours of coding but the rest
is stable.

I'm still fixing some docs and get all the projects up and running, so I still
have a lot of `bash` and some `markdown`, but `Python` is growing.

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/jul/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Editors are pretty much the same as last month's.

+ **Deconstructing the web** as a Guest speaker at [ELO7 Tech-talks](http://carreira.elo7.com.br/engenharia/)

Six presentations in one month. Three of them were in the same day. This month
is a personal record for me. 🎉

It was also a huge step towards my goal:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/jul/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/jul/presentations.png "")

Hm... I kinda finished the yearly challenge in July. 😬

Let's see how far I can go! :D

### Completed tasks

I want to add the amount of tasks completed on [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2017/jul/tasks-completed.png)

**554 tasks** completed this month. :D

I also included my streaks but I think I will have to improve my daily goals,
they are too small for me.

I have plans to create a better way to extract data from my Todoist account, but
I will need some time to work on it.

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/jul/podcasts.jpg)

**2 days and 18 hours** of podcast time, that's a lot. :)

I decided to keep a list of the Podcasts and their times as well.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/jul/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/jul/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just for the record, this is an "all time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

[Castalio Podcast](http://castalio.info/) is going up every month. I was a guest [on their podcast](http://castalio.info/episodio-110-willian-molinari-desconstruindo-a-web.html), btw! :D

### Hours working

Here are the data from my time tracking software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. My full-time job is
taking all my energy currently and there is not so much time spent working as a
freelancer this month. The good part is that I'm working a lot less
than [the previous months](/post/stats-may-2017/#working-hours) but I'm
exhausted in the same way.

There is another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/jul/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

It was really hard to work on personal projects this month. This 11 hours was my
presentations. I did not consider the whole day speaking at TDC though. :)

Here is my data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570):

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/jul/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/jul/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

Another month reaching my productivity goal! :D

**The only month I reached my goal before joining Doist was March**, the month
right after my vacations, and now it's the second month in a row. Hope to keep
it.

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/jul/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/jul/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
**8k** steps (249/31), it came back to my previous average.

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **8.3km**:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-distance.png "")

Some more weight but not so much:

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jul/physical-activity-weight.png "")

MiFit app interface for sleep data changed a little bit but here is my data for
this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep.jpg "")

A bit more average sleeping (**7h29m** for the last month) and **a lot** more
deep sleeping for this month \o/ (last month was **1h04**).

I bought the Mi band 2, it may have some better monitoring. Let's see how it
goes for the next month. :)

There's a new feature comparing my stats to the user base:

[![Stats about my sleep data](/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep_stats.jpg "Stats about my sleep data")](/images/stats/2017/jul/sleep_stats.jpg "")

I liked it. :)

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 24 episodes this month.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/jul/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/jul/tvshows.jpg "")

It's a combination of the two seasons of **Mr. Robot** (really recommended for
programmers, BTW), **American Gods**, and **Game of Thrones**.

I spent **20 hours** watching TV this month.

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **51018** words written (**34156** last month)
+ **1272** corrections made (**634** last month)
+ **10485** unique words (**10332** last month)

Since all my work conversations are in English, I have a lot more data here.
Less unique words than last month (🤔) but almost 1/3 more words. The bad part
is the corrections made, **2x more** than last month. =/

### Locations

Again, for some reason 1 city is gone from my timeline, that's weird. In the
other hand, the amount of places I visited increased by **14**. I'm not sure if
I can trust on this data from Google Maps.

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/jul/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/jul/location-general.png "")

I also decided to add the amount of time spent in a vehicle this month:

[![Location time and distance](/images/stats/2017/jul/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance")](/images/stats/2017/jul/location-time-distance.png "")

My presentations increased the time spent on transport, I think. I don't know if
I can trust on the distance walking.

But still, 16 hours in transport for the whole month! **Remote work FTW**!

Here is a funny metric:

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2017/jul/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2017/jul/location-moon.png "")

The time I have to walk to "get to the moon", LOL.

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/jul/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/jul/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this
month**. [As predicted last month](/post/stats-jun-2017/), I did not receive
anything because I was still waiting for the whole process to get my company
ready to generate invoices. It took almost two months to complete but I think
it's done and I can finally generate new invoices to receive my payment.

Most part of my expenses goes to "Despesas do trabalho" (work expenses), since I
had to pay a lot of taxes to get my own company ready.

It was amazing to find that I still increased my total savings by **0.5%** (not
so much compared to **5.2%** of the last month, but it's positive!) and reached
**72.83%** of my goal. It happened thanks to my wife supporting our expenses. ❤️


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric.

**It took 3 hours to write this post**

1 hour less than last month but I will still work to improve this time.


### Conclusion

My new job is taking a lot of my energies. There is a lot of work to do and new
stuff to learn. I'm doing my best to make the software I love since 2007 become
a great platform to developers build their stuff on top of it.

I was not expecting to be so tired at the end of the day, I had to put some
personal projects aside for some months.

Aside of that, the company and my co-workers are great, I'm really enjoying the
experience of building a great product.
