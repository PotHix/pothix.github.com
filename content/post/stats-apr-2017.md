This was not a good month. I spent most of the time sick, recovering
from what may be a Labyrinthitis. I still have to confirm that, but
I'm in slow motion for a while.

But anyways, let's go to the collected data.

### Books

Books for this month:

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

"Einstein no Brasil" (Einstein in Brazil) is a physical book I
borrowed from a friend
and [The Art of The Lord of the Rings](http://amzn.to/2rW9stD) I have
in my shelf (as a good LotR
fan). [The power of broke](http://amzn.to/2sx3a4v) is an audiobook
from the guy of the Shark Tank TV show
and [Spaceman](http://amzn.to/2rqMXt8) is a **great** book
from
[Mike Massimino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Massimino),
the astronaut.

### Articles

I'm using the same export file from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate my articles:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}

824
596
```

It means I have **824 articles Unread** and **596 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month, I got almost **8%
more unread** and less than **5% more read articles**. I have to work on
that. :P

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

It was going well at the beginning but then I got sick and my
productivity is dropped with it.

I was playing with Python a little bit, so I had Python, Ruby and Go
as the most used languages for this month:

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/apr/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Emacs is my main editor but Vim is still there. I [configured my Bash to send reports to Wakatime as well](https://github.com/irondoge/bash-wakatime).

### Speaking

Unfortunately, there was no presentations for this month. My goal for
this year is to beat [Milhouse](http://milhouseonsoftware.com.br) best
score (19 presentations last year). Here is my burn down chart for
this (actually, a burn up [?]):

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/apr/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/apr/presentations.png "")


### Podcasts

As I said in my last stats post, I'm back
to
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en). This
time I decided to buy the application, the developer deserves it. Here is the data:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/apr/podcasts.jpg)

I removed some data to become easy to see April stats. It was 2 days
and 18 hours listening to Podcasts this month.

As I'm using Podcast Addict again, I decided to keep a list of the
Podcasts and their times as well.

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/apr/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/apr/podcast_titles.jpg)

### Hours working

Here is the data from my current time
tracking, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. There is
another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/apr/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

My data from [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) is not so good for this month:

[![Goal of productive hours on RescueTime](/images/stats/2017/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png "Goal of productive hours on RescueTime")](/images/stats/2017/apr/rescuetime-productivetime.png "")

But I was expecting something like that already =/

### Physical activity

As expected my average of steps a day dropped. Currently it's around **6k steps**.

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **9.3km** walking:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-distance.png "")

My weight is almost the same for the whole month. There is a visible
outlier because I was testing a different application and inserted an
invalid value. My fault.

[![My weight for this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-weight.png "My weight for this month")](/images/stats/2017/apr/physical-activity-weight.png "")

Again, I slept more this month but with less deep sleeping, but just 1
minute less:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/apr/sleep.jpg "")

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 22 episodes this month.

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/apr/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/apr/tvshows.jpg "")

It's probably a combination of **Better call saul**, **Sense 8**, and
**How I met your mother**. As you can see, the first days of May
already have a lot of episodes watches, and it's because of a **How I
met your mother** marathon.

I spent almost 1 day of my life watching TV Series this month.

### Locations

This month I visited 13 more places (the last month were **325 places**):

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/apr/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/apr/location-general.png "")

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, so I don't know if I will keep these
metrics because it take some time to build it. Here is an example of
the data sent via email:

[![Example data of grammarly weekly](/images/stats/2017/apr/grammarly.png "Example data of grammarly weekly")](/images/stats/2017/apr/grammarly.png "")

Anyways, here is the data for this month:

+ **37844** words written
+ **168** corrections made
+ **15160** unique words

Here are my common mistakes:

+ **267** Possibly confused preposition
+ **100** Missing comma in compound sentence
+ **38** Confused preposition
+ **6** Comma splice
+ **4** Missing comma after introductory phrase

### Expenses

My expenses for this month are balanced again:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/apr/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/apr/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represent only 15% of net income**, the rest is being
invested. This month was atypical because I received the money related
to my freelance work on January and March. I also received the yearly
bonus from my full time job.

This month increased my total savings by **9%**! Pretty good! :)

### Conclusion

It was not so nice to be sick, as expected. My productivity dropped a
little bit and I have to go to the doctor this month and look for it.

Hope to be in a good health next month. :)
