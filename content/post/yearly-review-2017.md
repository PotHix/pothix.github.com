I don't remember the last time I posted my yearly review publicly but
as I'm doing a monthly posts of my stats, it makes sense to do an
yearly review as well.

I do yearly reviews since around 2009 but I never post about them. I
also write about my goals for the next year, so I can review them in
the last week of the year (like I'm doing now). I write a lot of
content but usually don't publish it because I try to keep this blog
less personal. The stats posts are here because I really think it's
great to have metrics about yourself, so you can improve. These posts
aim to show that in a practical way while helps me to commit to write
monthly.

I will try to follow a template like the one I use for my [monthly stats](/tags/stats) but I will also add some other items and notes about my goals.

### ‚úÖ Books

My yearly goal was to read 30 books this year and I read 31.

Last year I read 42 but I decided to not be so aggressive this year
and try a different strategy. The idea was to add a full review
on [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) after the book is finished, so I
can think about how much I understood and retained about the book.

The experiment was really nice and it helped me to add notes about the
parts I liked in the book. I'm
using [Google keep](https://keep.google.com) for that and have a label
for book notes. These notes help me to get into the context of the
book. They are also easy to find using Google Keep's search engine
when I need to find a reference.

Here are the books I really recommend reading from this year's list:

* 

You can always look for my whole list of books read this year on Goodreads. TODO

Here are some stats provided by Goodreads:

"")


### ‚úÖ Articles

Unfortunately, I don't have data for the whole year but I can use the
data I have from March to December.

I could not find a great way to track the articles I read. While I'm
still looking for a better way to do that, I'm
using [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and manually checking it every month. It means that every article I read since March was added to Pocket. Sometimes I read from there but others I just add to count as read.

In March I had **760 articles Unread** and **570 articles Read**.
Now, using the data from my [December stats post](/post/stats-dec-2017), I have **TODO articles Unread** and **TODO articles Read**.

It means that I read TODO articles this year, an average of TODO each
month. I'm aware that I will probably never read all those TODO
articles left in my Pocket account and I'm OK with that.

I had no goal for reading articles but I decided to track that to understand how much I read every year. Before starting with audiobooks I was really frustrated with the state of my reading stats. I was not reading many books in the year but I found that I read many articles, which is not so bad. By tracking that I have the data I need to prove to myself that I'm reading enough, which helps with the impostor symdrome. TODO(add link)

### Coding

TODO: not sure about how to measure coding yet

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/dec/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")


### ‚úÖ Speaking

I have to say that I'm really proud of myself on this one. üòÉ

Here is the burn down chart I created to follow up each month (nothing fancy, a simple Google spreadsheets):

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/dec/presentations.png "")

For those who don't know yet (because again, I usually don't post
publicly many things), I was in a competition
with [Milhouse](https://milhouseonsoftware.com)'s last year ghost.

This story is worth sharing since it was part of my goals:

_In December 2016 I asked Milhouse about how many talks he gave and he_
_said it was 18 talks. I was stunned. At the time, I was really proud_
_of my personal record of 12 talks in one year and I know it was really_
_hard to achieve this number. I asked him to post about it on his blog_
_and [here it is](TODO). When I saw that, I started a competition with_
_myself, my goal was: **To speak in 2017 more than Milhouse did in 2016**_.

It is like a time trial race in video games when you have to defeat
your own "ghost" or the "ghost" of a friend. For those who played bike
racer from [TFG](TODO), it's just like that.

It may look silly but I always do competitions like that to motivate
myself. Sometimes I use my own data and others I use the data from
someone who did amazing things. This time was really nice because I
told that I was doing it to some friends (including Milhouse) and it
was a cool internal joke between us.

Thanks to that "competition" I could motivate myself to:

* Propose a talk to FOSDEM and speak outside of the country in a
  different language. Milhouse had 1 talk outside of Brazil, so I had
  to beat that. For this reason I spoke in Belgium and Portugal.
* Speak 3 times in the same conference (TDC) about 3 different
  languages (Go, Ruby, Javascript) and 3 different areas (CLIs, Web,
  Games)
* Do 5 talks with live-coding. 3 of them starting from scratch, with a
  blank text file and 40 minutes of time (For those who don't know,
  one of my biggest fears was live-coding talks)

Met a lot of new people, studied many languages, and had **a ton** of
fun. I really recommend this motivation hacking. It's not just for
speaking, you can use it for anything you want.

### Completed tasks

TODO: Wait for my year in review from Todoist and check if it worth posting

### ‚úÖ Podcasts

**560 hours** (TODO, add december) listening to Podcasts. If I was
listening to the episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn't) it would
be equivalent to more than 23 days of non-stop listening. My app says
that I listened TODO days and TODO hours, but I decided to not trust
it because I changed my Podcast application in the beginning of the
year and restored a backup after it, so I don't know if it's
accurate. Instead of using the value calculated by the app, I
calculated month by month based on my posts.

These are the most listened Podcast feeds for this year:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/dec/podcast_titles.jpg)

I consider that one month of extra time since I listen to Podcasts
while commuting, walking the dog, cleaning the dishes, doing
exercises, etc. It works **really well** for me and I do some time
sharing between Podcasts and audiobooks.

### Hours working

TODO: Do a deep analysis in the following areas
* Amount of deep work
* Amount of meetings
* Amount of work in personal projects
* Number of productive hours according to rescuetime
* Check if it is better or worst in the new job

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/dec/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
**6.3k** steps (190625/30). It was kinda disappointing as it's below my
average. I will work on it for the next month. :)

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **8.4km** walking in one day:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/physical-activity-distance.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/sleep.jpg "")

Some more minutes of average sleeping (**7h31m** for the last month)
but also less deep sleeping (last month was **1h58**) üò¢

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 36
episodes this month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "")

This month we finished **Orphan Black (season 4 and 5)** and started **Billions**.

I spent **1 day and 3 hours** of my life watching TV shows this month.


### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I'm writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **71062** words written (in September it was **73969**)
+ **1091** corrections made (in September it was **1826**)
+ **17429** unique words (in September it was **17139**)

I'm comparing to September because October was not a typical month. I had fewer words written but I can see that I had fewer corrections made and more unique words! That makes me feel good. üòÅ

### Locations

This year was amazing regarding traveling. I went to Belgium,
Netherlands, Scotland, England, Portugal, Spain, and visited many
different cities. I'm planning some posts about those cities for a
while now, maybe someday.

With that said, I don't know if I can trust the data provided by Google Locations. Take your own conclusions:

Unfortunately, I don't have my data for January, the first record was in February (after visiting more than 13 cities in 4 countries):

[![General data for February](/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png "")

Data for December:

[![General data for December](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png "")

It doesn't look so different even with all those travels. The total
places visited looks reasonable but the cities and countries doesn't
behave well.

I use Google maps and Google trips to find new places to go. I'm a [Google maps local guide](TODO) and I usually add reviews to the map. As a side-effect of that, I have stars in almost all places I go.

I'm really happy with the current state of my maps:

TODO: print screen of my Google maps

To to have many other stars soon. :)

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/dec/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this month**. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described [in](/post/stats-jul-2017) [the](/post/stats-jun-2017/) [last](/post/stats-aug-2017) [five](/post/stats-sep-2017) [months](/post/stats-oct-2017) still
persists, for this reason, there's no money coming yet. :(

This month I finally had some good news and the process is almost done, just waiting for the final document. Hope to have something to show next month.

And again... If you're reading this every month, you already know that
my wife is paying all of our bills until my situation gets back to
normal and I'm really glad to have someone to rely on when things like
these happen. ‚ù§

This month is back to normal and my wife helped to keep our expenses
in a good shape. My total savings **increased by 0.6%** and now I have
**73.70%** of my goal.


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric

**It took 3 hours and 30 minutes to write this post**


### Conclusion

Just came back from a trip last month to prepare to travel again this
month. I'm writing this post from the winter
of [York](https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982), it's -1 Celsius but feels
like -7. I worked a lot this month but it enabled me to keep my
work on schedule for the travel so I think it worth it.

I did not receive any money yet but everything is moving forward
now and I hope to have a nice December with everything set up. :)
