**Brace yourselves, this post will be HUGE**

**TL;DR**: It was a **great** year and I'm really glad to see the
metrics and notice everything I accomplished.

I don't remember the last time I posted my yearly review publicly but
as I'm doing monthly posts of my stats, it makes sense to do an yearly
review as well.

I do yearly reviews since around 2005 but I never post them
publicly. I also write down my goals for the next year, so I can
review them in the last week of the year (like I did some weeks
ago). I write a lot of content but usually don't publish it because I
try to keep this blog less personal. The stats posts are here because
I really think it's great to have metrics about yourself, so you can
evaluate and improve (remember: continuous improvement). These posts
aim to show that in a practical way while help me to commit to write
them monthly.

I will try to follow a template like the one I use for
my [monthly stats](/tags/stats) but I will also add some other items
and notes about my goals.


### ✅ Books

My yearly goal was to read 30 books this year and I read 31.

Last year I read 42 but I decided to not be so aggressive this year
and try a different strategy. The idea was to add a full review
on [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) after the book is finished, so I
can think about how much I understood and retained about it.

The experiment went really well and helped me with the process of
adding more notes about the important parts (IMO) of the book. I'm
using [Google keep](https://keep.google.com) for that, using a label
for book notes. These notes help me to get into the context of the
book. They are also easy to find using Google Keep's search engine
when I need to find a reference.

Here are the books from this year's list that I really recommend
reading, with links to my review:

Non-Fiction

* [Mastery](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1642811841)
* [What Doesn't Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning will Renew our Lost Evolutionary Strength](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055058923)
* [Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055503546)
* [Spaceman: An Astronaut's Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1968545292)
* [Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243)

Fiction

* [Rendezvous with Rama](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2057742804)

You can always look for my whole
[list of books read this year on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2017&sort=date_read).

Here are some stats provided by Goodreads TODO:

### ✅ Articles

Unfortunately, I don't have data for the whole year but I can use the
data I have from March to December.

I could not find a good way to track the articles I read. While I'm
still looking for a better way to do that, I'm
using [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and manually checking it every
month. It means that every article I read since March was added to
Pocket. Sometimes I read from there but others I just add it there to
count as read.

In March I had **760 articles Unread** and **570 articles Read**. Now,
using the data from my [December stats post](/post/stats-dec-2017), I
have **1296 articles Unread** and **946 articles Read**.

It means that **I read 186 articles this year**, an average of **15
articles each month**. I'm aware that I will probably never read all
those 1296 articles left in my Pocket account and I'm OK with that.

Worth mentioning that my definition of article read is when I found
some interesting and useful article and read that from bottom to end.

I had no goal for reading articles but I decided to track that to
understand how much I read every year. Before starting with audiobooks
I was really frustrated with the state of my reading stats. I was not
reading many books in the year but I had a feeling that I was reading
many articles, which is not so bad. By tracking that I have the data I
need to prove to myself that I'm reading enough, which helps with the
[impostor symdrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).

### ✅ Coding

All my coding metrics are provided by [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix).

First, let's take a look at the total time coding:

[![Total time coding this year](/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png "Total time coding this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I confess that I was expecting much more than that. An average of 1h31
per day looks really low for me.

I felt better when checking the comparison with the user base. It
shows that I have almost twice as much hours coding! :)

The low number of hours is probably related to how Wakatime gets the
stats.

[![Total time coding by project this year](/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png "Total time coding by project this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

This year I did a lot for this blog. Changed the entire layout,
migrated it to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), converted all posts to Hugo
format, redirected old URLs to the new content, and wrote 19 posts (my
goal was 10! 😃). It's expected to have my blog as the first in the
list of projects for this year.

It's really interesting to have my freelance project as the second one
because I almost not work for them in the last 6 months! It says that
I was working for them **a lot** in the beginning of the year.

I'm really proud to have [Todoist](https://todoist.com) in my list of
projects this year. I'm using/following Todoist since 2007 and it's
amazing to have the chance to contribute to the app. 🙂

[![Total time coding by editor this year](/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png "Total time coding by editor this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Looks like I fully switched to Emacs. I'm not using Vim as I used
before but sometimes I miss some Vim features. I was talking to a
friend last week about it and I mentioned that if I was still using
querty
([I use Colemak](/experiences-of-almost-two-years-using-colemak/)) I
would probably be still using Vim. Emacs is nice and so is Vim. :)

I was using a plugin to register my terminal usage but I think it
generated more noise than signal. 😞

[![Total time coding by language this year](/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png "Total time coding by language this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Markdown is the first one for many reasons:

* I wrote many posts in my blog
* I'm responsible for [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com)
  and [Twist](https://developer.twistapp.com) documentation
* I usually write long post in Emacs and then paste them to Twist

Other than that, we have **Python**, **Ruby**, **Go**, and a little
bit of **Rust**, **Elixir**, and **Javascript**. I was playing with
game development in Javascript this year and I really bet in Rust and
Elixir, both languages are really great. I don't think I will have
enough ground to play with Elixir this year but maybe Rust will have
his time in my schedule in 2018. 😃

**Go** is in my top 5 list but I'm not totally comfortable as I would
like to be, hope to improve it in 2018.

Forget about "Other" it's related to Bash because of my plugin. 🙄

In general, these are great results IMO. 😃

### ✅ Speaking

I have to say that I'm really proud of myself on this one. 😃

Here is the burn down chart I created to follow up each month (nothing fancy, a simple Google spreadsheets):

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/yir/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/yir/presentations.png "")

For those who don't know yet (because I usually don't post publicly
many things), I was in a "competition"
with *[Milhouse](http://milhouseonsoftware.com)'s last year ghost*.

This story is worth sharing since it was part of my goals:

_In December 2016 I asked Milhouse about how many talks he gave and he_
_said it was 18 talks. I was stunned. At the time, I was really proud_
_of my personal record of 12 talks in one year and I know it was really_
_hard to achieve this number. I asked him to post about it on his blog_
*and [here it is](http://milhouseonsoftware.com/2016/12/29/retro_216/)*.
_When I saw that, I started a competition with_
_myself, my goal was **to speak in 2017 more than Milhouse did in 2016**_.

It is like a time trial race in video games, when you have to defeat
your own "ghost" or the "ghost" of a friend. For those who played bike
racer from [Top Free Games](http://www.topfreegames.com/), it's just
like that.

It may look silly but I always do "competitions" like that to motivate
myself. Sometimes I use my own data and others I use the data from
someone I admire or someone who did amazing things. This time was
really nice because I told that I was doing it to some friends
(including Milhouse) and it was a cool internal joke between us.

Thanks to that "competition" I could motivate myself to:

* Propose a talk to [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) and speak outside the
  country in a different language. Milhouse had 1 talk outside of
  Brazil, so I had to beat that. For this reason I spoke in Belgium
  and Portugal.
* Speak 3 times in the same conference
  ([TDC](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br)) about 3 different
  languages (Go, Ruby, Javascript) and 3 different fields (CLIs, Web,
  Games)
* Do 5 talks with live-coding. 3 of them starting from scratch, with a
  blank text file and 40 minutes of time (For those who don't know,
  one of my biggest fears was live-coding talks)

Met a lot of new people, studied many languages, and had **a ton** of
fun. I really recommend this motivation hacking. It's not just for
speaking, you can use it for anything you want.


### Completed tasks

In the last years, Todoist is providing a Year in review and this year
is not different. If you're a Todoist user, you can check your
data [here](https://todoist.com/review/2017/you).

Let's check my Todoist tasks! 🙂

[![Tasks completed on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png "Tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png "")

Hm, less than I expected but still OK. I was already expecting for
that but looks like **Monday is the day I complete more tasks**:

[![Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png "Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png "")

**My most productive time is 16:00** and **what I can't finish at this
time I usually postpone at 19:00** 😬:

[![Tasks completed by time and postponed by time](/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "Tasks completed by time and postponed by time")](/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "")

I'm in the top 1% of all Todoist users in 2017! 😃

This *Year in Review* by Todoist is astonishing! I had the chance to
contribute by helping with the pt-BR translation. 🙂


### ✅ Podcasts

**587 hours** listening to Podcasts. If I was listening to the
episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn't) it would be equivalent to
more than 23 days of non-stop listening. My app says that I listened
17 days and 7 hours, but I decided to not trust it because I changed
my Podcast application in the beginning of the year and restored a
backup after it, so I don't know if it's accurate. Instead of using
the value calculated by the app, I calculated month by month based on
my posts.

I consider that one month of extra time since I listen to Podcasts
while commuting, walking the dog, washing the dishes, doing exercises,
etc. It works **really well** for me and sometimes I change between
Podcasts and audiobooks.

### Hours working

TODO: Do a deep analysis in the following areas
* Amount of deep work
* Amount of meetings
* Amount of work in personal projects
* Number of productive hours according to rescuetime
* Check if it is better or worst in the new job

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/yir/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/yir/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of
**6.3k** steps (190625/30). It was kinda disappointing as it's below my
average. I will work on it for the next month. :)

And these are my steps each day:

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/yir/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/yir/physical-activity-steps.png "")

My max distance was **8.4km** walking in one day:

[![Travelled distance this month](/images/stats/2017/yir/physical-activity-distance.png "Travelled distance this month")](/images/stats/2017/yir/physical-activity-distance.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep.jpg "")

Some more minutes of average sleeping (**7h31m** for the last month)
but also less deep sleeping (last month was **1h58**) 😢

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 36
episodes this month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/yir/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/yir/tvshows.jpg "")

This month we finished **Orphan Black (season 4 and 5)** and started **Billions**.

I spent **1 day and 3 hours** of my life watching TV shows this month.


### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the number of words and errors when I'm writing. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **71062** words written (in September it was **73969**)
+ **1091** corrections made (in September it was **1826**)
+ **17429** unique words (in September it was **17139**)

I'm comparing to September because October was not a typical month. I had fewer words written but I can see that I had fewer corrections made and more unique words! That makes me feel good. 😁

### Locations

This year was amazing regarding traveling. I went to Belgium,
Netherlands, Scotland, England, Portugal, Spain, and visited many
different cities. I'm planning some posts about those cities for a
while now, maybe someday.

With that said, I don't know if I can trust the data provided by Google Locations. Take your own conclusions:

Unfortunately, I don't have my data for January, the first record was in February (after visiting more than 13 cities in 4 countries):

[![General data for February](/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png "")

Data for December:

[![General data for December](/images/stats/2017/yir/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/yir/location-general.png "")

It doesn't look so different even with all those travels. The total
places visited looks reasonable but the cities and countries doesn't
behave well.

I use Google maps and Google trips to find new places to go. I'm a [Google maps local guide](TODO) and I usually add reviews to the map. As a side-effect of that, I have stars in almost all places I go.

I'm really happy with the current state of my maps:

TODO: print screen of my Google maps

To to have many other stars soon. :)

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/yir/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/yir/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this month**. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described [in](/post/stats-jul-2017) [the](/post/stats-jun-2017/) [last](/post/stats-aug-2017) [five](/post/stats-sep-2017) [months](/post/stats-oct-2017) still
persists, for this reason, there's no money coming yet. :(

This month I finally had some good news and the process is almost done, just waiting for the final document. Hope to have something to show next month.

And again... If you're reading this every month, you already know that
my wife is paying all of our bills until my situation gets back to
normal and I'm really glad to have someone to rely on when things like
these happen. ❤

This month is back to normal and my wife helped to keep our expenses
in a good shape. My total savings **increased by 0.6%** and now I have
**73.70%** of my goal.


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it takes to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric

**It took 3 hours and 30 minutes to write this post**


### Conclusion

Just came back from a trip last month to prepare to travel again this
month. I'm writing this post from the winter
of [York](https://goo.gl/maps/zx1s3AeFo982), it's -1 Celsius but feels
like -7. I worked a lot this month but it enabled me to keep my
work on schedule for the travel so I think it worth it.

I did not receive any money yet but everything is moving forward
now and I hope to have a nice December with everything set up. :)
