Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel
again this month. Let's see if it affected my performance.

### Books

[![List of books read this month](/images/stats/2017/nov/goodreads.png "List of books read this month")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft,
called [At the mountains of madness](http://amzn.to/2AO5IPW) was one
of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read
about [minimalism](http://amzn.to/2nqZG2h) just to realize that I'm a
minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to
listen to their [podcast](https://www.theminimalists.com/podcast/) and
read their website.

The last book is [On power](http://amzn.to/2Ath5tX) which was probably
the worst book this year. It was so small that I could finish but I
can't say that I learned a lot from it.

I also started
reading [The Rust Programming language](http://amzn.to/2nrzm8p)
because I'm playing with Rust a little bit. I still want to
finish [Elixir in Action](http://amzn.to/2ztCDZU) but it will take a
while.

### Articles

As usual, I'm using that same export file
from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and the same script to calculate
the amount of articles I read:

```
var uls=document.body.getElementsByTagName("ul");
for(var i=0; i<uls.length; i++) {
    console.log(uls[i].children.length)
}
1255
931
```

It means I have **1255 articles Unread** and **931 articles
Read**. Comparing with my results from the last month (**1230 unread**
and **905 read**), I got around **1.7% more unread articles** and **1%
more read articles**.

Almost the same growth of the last month. For me, it means that it was
a good thing to check my Feedly once a week but that doesn't change
the amount of articles I read and it's probably be the new delicious.

### Coding

Here goes the charts from [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix)
since the last post.

[![Hours of coding on Wakatime this month](/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-coding.png "Hours of coding on Wakatime this month")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

The empty days are related to a holiday in Brazil and a huge amount of technical tickets and support for our APIs during that week. It was the price to day for focused work in the week before. :)

[![Languages used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-languages.png "Languages used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

`markdown` is usually the most used language because I write long texts in emacs before posting on [Twist](https://twistapp.com). I removed the `bash` plugin from my terminal in the middle of the month, so that 38% doesn't make much sense. And then... **Rust**! That is what I was playing with in the previous week to the big list of support tickets. It was a fun week.

[![Editors used during this month on Wakatime](/images/stats/2017/nov/wakatime-editors.png "Editors used during this month on Wakatime")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Nothing new here. Emacs at the top, bash being removed and Vim.

### Speaking

+ **Desconstruindo a web** at [Codus](http://www.codus.com.br/) tech-talks
+ **Desconstruindo a web - Sua app ruby end to end** at [TOTVS Tech day](http://www.totvstechday.io/)

Here is the chart comparing to my goal for this year:

[![Burn down chart for my presentations](/images/stats/2017/nov/presentations.png "Burn down chart for my presentations")](/images/stats/2017/nov/presentations.png "")

Just reached my last goal for this year. **25 talks in one year** is more than I could have ever imagined. Now it's time to take a break and enjoy the last month of the year. :)

### Completed tasks

This is the amount of tasks completed on [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

[![Amount of tasks completed this month](/images/stats/2017/nov/tasks-completed.png "Amount of tasks completed this month")](/images/stats/2017/nov/tasks-completed.png)

**404 tasks** completed this month (**17 more** than last month).

This time I have some other colors in the chart. It's related to internal Todoist projects but most part of it is still personal (red) and work-related (blue).

### Podcasts

Here is my
[Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) stats:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month](/images/stats/2017/nov/podcasts.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month")](/images/stats/2017/nov/podcasts.jpg)

**2 days and 17 hours** of podcast time, 1 day more than last month. It happened
because I decided to catch up to the unheard episodes when I got home. 😄

As usual, here is the list of Podcasts and their times:

[![Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title](/images/stats/2017/nov/podcast_titles.jpg "Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts, ordered by title")](/images/stats/2017/nov/podcast_titles.jpg)

Just remember that this is an "all time list" and I'm tracking time
instead of episode which makes short podcasts to not appear as "most
listened" ones. I listen to
[CBN podcasts](http://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm) almost
every day, but they are just some minutes long.

### Hours working

Here are the data from my time tracking software, [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Hours working using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working.png "Hours working using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working.png "")

The above chart is just for my freelance and full-time job. As you can see, I
took many days totally off. :)

[![Deep vs Shallow work](/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "Deep vs Shallow work")](/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-working-deep-shallow.png "")

I tried to use Toggl when I was in the office just to compare with my
productivity at home. It was almost the same as if I'm working from home, so
kudos to the Porto office. :)

There is another chart for my personal projects:

[![Hours working on personal projects using Toggl](/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "Hours working on personal projects using Toggl")](/images/stats/2017/nov/toggl-time-personal-projects.png "")

As expected, just the time related to my talk at Porto Python.

I will not post my data related to **rescuetime** this month because I was
working in the fix for my problem and their team fixed the problem. Rescuetime
stats will be back next month. :)

### Physical activity

I'm using my Mi band data to calculate my average steps:

[![Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app](/images/stats/2017/nov/activity.jpg "Activity data for this month by Mi-Fit app")](/images/stats/2017/nov/activity.jpg "")

According to this data, I can conclude that I had a daily average of **11.6k**
steps (359/31). I think `mean` is not a good aggregation function for this data
because when I was traveling I had days like this:

[![Walking around Toledo](/images/stats/2017/nov/walking-toledo.jpg "Walking around Toledo")](/images/stats/2017/nov/walking-toledo.jpg "")

Well... I really like to walk when I'm traveling. :)

Unfortunately, my Google fit is missing some data, so I will not post all charts
as usual.

[![Amount of steps for this month](/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-steps.png "Amount of steps for this month")](/images/stats/2017/nov/physical-activity-steps.png "")

Here is my sleep data for this month:

[![Amount of sleep for this month](/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep.jpg "Amount of sleep for this month")](/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep.jpg "")

Almost the same as the last month but 10 minutes more for **avg sleep** and
**avg deep sleep**. There are some comparisons with their database:

[![Deep sleep comparison](/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg "Deep sleep comparison")](/images/stats/2017/nov/sleep_deep_comparison.jpg "")

I'm not so bad after all. :)

### TV Shows

According to [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) I watched 15 episodes this
month:

[![TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime](/images/stats/2017/nov/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime")](/images/stats/2017/nov/tvshows.jpg "")

When I got back, we decided to watch **Stranger Things (season 2)** and get back
to **Orphan Black (season 3)**.

It's still difficult to calculate how much time I spent watching TV this month
(because I could not track last month in a good way) but I think I watched 17
hours of TV. I used [tii.me](http://tii.me) to calculate the second season of
stranger things and calculated 40 min for each of the 5 episodes of Orphan
black.

### Words written and errors

I'm using [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) to improve my English and
track the amount of words and errors when I'm writting. Unfortunately,
they only send weekly emails, but I will try to keep this metric for a
while.

Here are my stats for this month:

+ **49657** words written (last month was **73969**), **26487** of them written
  in the last week of October
+ **1212** corrections made (last month was **1826**), **772** of them made in
  the last week of October
+ **12725** unique words (last month was **17139**), **5806** of them written in
  the last week of October

This month is really atypical and should not be compared with the previous month
but it has its own interesting facts. The last week of October was really
interesting. I had a lot of material to compile and write down for my team. For
this reason there is a lot of words written.

### Locations

This section is really nice! 😁
As I said, I visited two new countries:

[![New countries](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-countries.png "New countries")](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-countries.png "")

And 5 new cities:

[![New cities](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-cities.png "New cities")](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-cities.png "")

Unfortunately, the email sent by Google timeline was not so descriptive this
time. But the other 2 cities are [Toledo](https://goo.gl/maps/GWf9vcDakNB2)
and [Lisbon](https://goo.gl/maps/THiztuMChqs).

So, in summary:

[![General view of my locations data](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-general.png "")

It was almost 100 new places visited 😱.

Here is the time spend in vehicles:

[![Location time and distance](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-time-distance.png "Location time and distance")](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-time-distance.png "")

I was expecting more time than that, but it looks accurate in case it's not
considering airplanes. I took a train from Lisbon to Porto (3.5 hours) and a
train from Madrid to Toledo and back (1.5h maybe).

[![Kms to the moon](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-moon.png "Kms to the moon")](/images/stats/2017/nov/location-moon.png "")

Hope to reach the moon some day.

### Expenses

My expenses for this month:

[![Expenses by category this month](/images/stats/2017/nov/expenses.jpg "Expenses by category this month")](/images/stats/2017/nov/expenses.jpg "")

This chart **represents all my income for this month**. And again, the number is
not wrong, I did not receive any money this month. The problem I described in
[the](/post/stats-jul-2017) [last](/post/stats-jun-2017/) [four](/post/stats-aug-2017) [months](/post/stats-sep-2017) still
persists, for this reason, there's no money coming yet. :(

Part of the problem seems to be solved and now I'm back to the normal
process. Hope to have everything set up this month.

If you're reading this every month, you already know that my wife is paying all
of our bills until my situation gets back to normal and I'm really glad to have
someone to rely on when things like these happen. ❤

I traveled to Europe last month and part of the expenses were paid by me to
receive the reimbursement for it later. As I'm not able to receive my payment
for some time now, it caused a negative impact in my savings.

My total savings **decreased by 1.31%**, which means that I have **73.26%** of my
goal. 😢


### Time to write this blog post

Some people are asking me about how much time it take to collect all
the data and write the blog post, so I decided to add this metric

**It took 4 hours and 10 minutes to write this post**


### Conclusion

It was a great month. I forgot about the whole problem of not being able to
receive any money and took the whole month to meet new people and places. 😄

It was really nice to meet 12 people (from 8 different countries) of the team in
person and also represent the company at [hackUPC](https://hackupc.com/).

During this trip I decided to say in hostels most of the time to talk to people
from different cultures (and also because I had to pay for it... 😄). I talked
to people from Germany, Poland, Spain, Scotland, Colombia, Canada, Lithuania,
Czech Republic, Japan, Brazil, Uruguay, Australia, Russia, Ireland, Portugal,
India, Belgium, Bosnia, France, Argentina, and Netherlands. It was not just a
"Hi, where are you from?", most of them were 30min+ conversations and some of
them took more then 2 hours.

I also bought a sword (a replica of Andúril), but that's a story for a different
post. :D

So...mission accomplished for this month. o/
