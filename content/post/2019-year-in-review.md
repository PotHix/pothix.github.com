**Brace yourselves, as any other stats post, this one will be HUGE**

My year in review for 2018 was never posted because I could never finish it. I
don't want to let the same thing happen this year, so here I am.

The end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was quite hard for me and I just
didn't have the energy to sit down in front of the computer during the weekends
to write my monthly reviews.

[![Failed attempts to write my stats posts](/images/stats/2019/yir/blog-stats-failed.png "Two stats blog posts as drafts, never finished")](/images/stats/2019/yir/blog-stats-failed.png "")

Some people still ask me to get back to write such reviews, but I couldn't make
this a priority for myself anymore. I don't want the same to happen to my Year
in review. I do it for many year already and I plan to keep doing it for a long
time. So **let's start**!

## Books

[![Year in books](/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads-year-in-books-logo.png "A logo of my avatar with 'My year in books' written")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

Although I did not meet my goal of 30 books read this year, I still consider
the 25 books read an achievements.

At some point I realized I was choosing my books to meet the goal. When picking
a new book from my wishlist, I was chosing the smallest ones first, not
necessarily the ones I wanted to read the most. It's not that bad, as I was
still chosing books from my library and wish list, but I don't want to have
such influence in the titles I pick.

25 books is a great mark IMO. You can see my 2019 Goodreads challenge
[here](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge). :)

I'm still using [Google keep](https://keep.google.com) to take notes of all the
books I read and I'm posting Goodreads reviews for them based on these notes.
You can see the reviews for 2019 by clicking on the books [on
Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14901302).

Here are the books from this year's list that I really recommend
reading, with links to my review:

* [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435182291)
* [Homo Deus](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055385130)
* [The Power of Habit](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1559101465) (second time I read this one)
* [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2606595802)
* [Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243)

There are also some from 2018, since I did not post my Year in review last
year:

* [When](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2254843906)
* [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055385224)
* [A Guide to the Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2355647662)
* [Principles](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2479523573)

You can always look for my whole
[list of books read in 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2019) and [2018](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2018) on Goodreads.

Here are some stats provided by Goodreads comparing all the books I
have registered:

[![List of books read by year](/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads.png "List of books read by year")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

I started [listening to audiobooks](/post/audiobooks/) in 2016 and we can
clearly see how excited I was. 😅 I can see now that I'm reducing the number of
books I'm reading every year, but I don't think I should be concerned by that.
The number of books should not surpass the quality of books and how much I'm
applying what I learn.

Let's compare the books I read this year with last year:

[![Comparison between 2017, 2018, and 2019](/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads-details.png "Comparison between 2017, 2018, and 2019")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

I used the number of pages because it clearly shows that I even read more than
2018, but not more books. I was not expecting that but it shows that I was
trying to be less focused on the number of books.

In 2017, I mentioned that I was disappointed with the number of 5 stars I gave.
It was probably related with the fact that I was buying cheaper books and
focusing on smaller ones as well. In 2018, I tried to fix that and it works.
I gave **7 five stars reviews** in 2018 and **five** in 2019. It seems these
metrics were useful after all. :)

In 2018, I read 2 books from my "audible-deal" shelf and in 2019 I read none.
From all the books I have on my "audible-deal", none of them were 5 stars. This
is probably a bad sign. On the other hand, I found some great books there and I
don't regret reading them
([Spaceman](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1968545292), [Rendezvous with
Rama](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2057742804), [What Doesn't Kill
Us](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055058923), etc.).

I was not feeling so good about the number of books I read this year, but after
writing this section I'm feeling much better. I'm happy with my results here. :)

## Articles

I couldn't finish my year in review for 2018, but the part about articles was
done, fortunately. There's no way to get the read date from pocket, so if I
want to collect it, I have to do it from time to time. Thanks past self! It was
not in vain after all. If you're reading this, I was successfully to publish
this post this time, so this is good news. 🤞

Different from [the review I did for 2017](post/2017-year-in-review/), I will
now have data for the full year. I will also mention the data I had for 2018,
since they were collected but never published.

In 2018, I had **1733 articles unread (22% increase comparing to 2017) and 1456
articles read (31% increase comparing to 2017)**.

In 2019, I have **1908 articles unread (9% increase comparing to 2018) and 1731
articles read (16% increase comparing to 2018)**.

It means that **I read 275 article this year**. It's a bit worse than 2018,
when I read 381, but it's still a good number IMO. It's an average of **23
articles each month**.  Again, it's worth mentioning that I'm aware that I will
probably wever read all those 1908 articles left in my Pocket account and I'm
OK with that.

I was expecing to have more data from
[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix) this year, but unfortunately,
it was a bit disappointing to not have much. They provided a year in review,
which I'm going to mention later, but the only thing about articles is that **it
says I read 263**, which is quite close to the number I had above. :)

## Coding

All my coding metrics are provided by
[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix). When we have a light blue bar inside
a dark blue one, it means the light one is the global average and the dark one
is the top coder. We should usually focus on the **light blue part of the bar**.

First, let's take a look at the total time coding:

[![Total time coding this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png "Total time coding this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

My daily average this year is even lower than the 1h31 per day I got on 2017,
which looks really low for me. I'm still above the average, but 47 mins in
average is a bit weird. 😐

I remember the official Wakatime profile [added a comment to my 2017
post](post/2017-year-in-review/) to mention that it may be related to the way
Wakatime records the numbers. I remember tweaking things a bit but I'm not sure
if I should increase the numbers to have unrealistic reports. Maybe I should
try to tweak the data collection once again.

[![Total time coding by project this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png "Total time coding by project this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I dedicated only 22 hours to this blog, compared to 80+ in 2017. I would like
to improve this, but I'm not sure if it will be a priority, unfortunately.

[Todoist](https://todoist.com) is my top project for this year, which is
expected since it's my main job. I expected to have more time tracked there,
but I'm not only coding for the main Todoist repository, so it makes sense. I
hope to also have [Twist](https://twist.com) as a relevant project on my lsit
of projects next year, or at least have integrations related to it.

I still keep the same freelance job I have for more than 4 years now. It became
almost a personal project for me. The good parts of working for them is that
the work is just coding and mostly bugs. I just need to sit down and write some
code when I feel like.

This year was totally atypical, since I took some time to migrate their
framework from one version to another. It was a big challenge, especially for
someone working using their spare time for that. I expect the number of hours
working on this project to totally shrink in 2020. Let's see.

[![Total time coding by editor this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png "Total time coding by editor this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I'm just using Linux, so it's expected to have it here. I'm using it much more
than the average as we can see. The "top coder" is an outlier for sure. 😜

In 2017, I wrote: _Looks like I fully switched to Emacs_. It seems thhings have changed again. I'm back to Vim now. 🙂

[![Total time coding by language this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png "Total time coding by language this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Markdown is still in this list for the same reasons I had in 2017:

* I still write posts on my blog using Markdown
* I'm responsible for [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com)
  and [Twist](https://developer.twistapp.com) documentation
* I usually write long post in Emacs/Vim and then paste them to Twist

There's no surprise that **Python** is the language I used the most this year,
since we use Python for almost everything at Doist.

I use Ruby at my freelance job, so there's no surprise to still have it there.

In 2017, I mentioned that _I don't think I will have enough ground to play with
Elixir this year but maybe Rust will have his time in my schedule in 2018._ It
was true about Elixir, unfortunately, but I had an improvement for Rust 🦀. I
even [had my first change merged into the
compiler](https://pothix.com/post/contributing-to-rust/)! The change itself was
quite simple, but it was great to understand how to contribute and hopefully
new contributions will come this year!

## Speaking

After 2017, I had a hangover of speaking. 😅

For those of you who remember, I spoke 24 times in 2017. I decided to create
some sort of a challenge for myself to speak more and was quite successful at
it. It was time to have a low schedule. 😃

To make things easier to track, I now have the [talks page](/talks), which I'm
going to use as a reference here.

+ **In 2018, I spoke 7 times with 6 different presentations. 6 different
presentations delivered in pt-BR and one of them delivered in English.**
+ **In 2019, I spoke 2 times and both were the same presentation. I spoke at the
local Ruby meetup and brought that same (sligthly changed) presentation to
Rubyconf Brasil.**

We can clearly see that I'm slowing down my pace of presentations. I came from
24 presentations in 2017, to 7 in 2018, to 2 in 2019. That's exactly what I
wanted to do. I have to say that I was already feeling bad to not be speaking
for some time and I was eager to speak in 2019. 😅 I don't think things are
change much for 2020 though.

It's also worth mentioning that I was also on stage last year, but not
delivering a talk. I was one of the core organizers of Rust LATAM, the first
big conference about Rust in Latin America.  It was a great experience and you
can read more about it [here](/post/how-was-rust-latam-2019/).


## Completed tasks

Every year Todoist releases an astonishing Year in review. Here is mine from
[2017](https://todoist.com/review/2017/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJ1QWNKZHhCQyIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxN30.zJQ9q-v1pyL1HwerqktZyNMLSwC7RxC0CKHUNdkoZQI),
[2018](https://todoist.com/review/2018/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJFaklzQ3BBeiIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOH0.2EMtZYiOkn8QjLUZjfgccy5ZUyfYtV5uGHfGgDSU1lQ),
and now
[2019](https://todoist.com/review/2019/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJmeU1mckJqdSIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOX0.HwRgJULd8lDN6FjCC5tcrMYVegrXQCk_X6D713bV14E),
which is the one we're going to explore.

Let's check my Todoist tasks! 🙂

[![Tasks completed on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png "Tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png "")
[![Average of tasks completed on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed2.png "Average of tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed2.png "")

It's a it less than what I expected since **I completed 6323 tasks in 2018**.
It's not a huge problem because it always depends on how you organize your task
manager. In my case, I also have my routine on my task manager so it can help
me to actually do the things I plan for myself. The plan for 2020 is to remove
my routine from Todoist and move it to my calendar, so I can only have the
important tasks there. By removing these tasks from Todoist, I will probably
have a report with less tasks next year and that's OK. 🙂

It looks like **Friday is the day I complete more tasks**:

[![Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png "Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png "")

I think it happens because I usually post my snippets every Friday, so I
complete the list of tasks I have to post there every Friday.

**My most productive time is 10:00** (not 16:00 as I had in 2017):

[![Tasks completed by time and postponed by time](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "Tasks completed by time and postponed by time")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "")

I found it very interesting that the productivity chart correlates with my When
tracked (wrote about it on [my current productivity worklow 2019](/post/my-current-productivity-workflow/)):

![A sheet of paper with something that looks like a chart showing the times I feel more productive](/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png)

Let's see how those tasks are distributed throughout the year. You can clearly see my vacations on the light gray columns:

[![Tasks completed by day on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "Tasks completed by day on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "")

I'm still one of the 1% heavy users of Todoist! 😃

[![Top 1% user of Todoist](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-top-1.png "Top 1% user of Todoist")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-top-1.png "")

The data and design of our year in review is awesome. I did not participate on
the project this year (as I did in 2017), but proud of what we are able to
deliver. 🎉

## Podcasts

[![Time listening to Podcasts this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "Time listening to Podcasts this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "")
[![Time listening by Podcasts](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-list.jpg "Time listening by Podcasts")](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-list.jpg "")

Unfortunately, I don't have data about 2018 anymore, so I will just mention
2019 here.

If I was listening to the episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn't) it would
be equivalent to **18 days and 4 hours** of non-stop listening. As I usually
listen to Podcast in 2x or more (depending on many factors), I would say I
spent around 9 days listening to Podcasts, which is **effectively around 216
hours of my time**.

I usually listen to Podcast when I'm commuting, walking the dog, washing the
dishes, doing exercises, etc. I'm usually focusing on
[audiobooks](https://pothix.com/post/audiobooks/), but I listen to podcasts
between one book and another.

The list of podcasts shown here are actually my global list, not the yearly
one, unfortunately. I'm not even listening to new episodes of some of these
anymore, but they are still there.

## Hours working, focusing and distractions

Let's start checking all my data tracked using [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Chart for time working in my full-time job](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-comparison.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

The gray bars are related to the data for 2018. I believe the changes are
related to my scheduled vacations. :)

Let's check my time working, considering my full-time job only:

[![Chart for time working in my full-time job](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-fulltime-job.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

April was conference + retreat + vacations for me, so it's an outlier.
Considering 40 days of vacations during the year (we don't have national
holidays, they are included in the 40 days) and dividing the average of 151
hours a month by 18 (21 working days - 3 days of vacations per month) **I have an
average of 8 hours and a half of work every day**. At [Doist](https://doist.com),
we recommend to not work more than 8 hours a day, so I'm working a bit more but
it's under control.

**I spent 81 hours of my year in meetings**. Most of them were weekly sync
meetings with my remote team and also a monthly 1-on-1 with the head of my
team. I consider all of those meetings productive. There was **not a single
meeting last year where I found myself wasting my time**, so this 81 hours are
actually fine.

The most interesting part for me is the Shallow x Deep work ratio. **I have
almost 3 times less time Deep working than Shallow working**, which is not that
good. This is totally something I have to improve in 2020.

To give a bit more of context, I consider Deep work any work I can do without
distraction. Shallow work is the work I do while I have other tabs opened on my
browser or while I'm doing something else on the side.

I think I'm not tracking that as I should. Sometimes I'm focused on reading
Twist and answering questions, but as it's not coding, I consider it as shallow
work. I will certainly improve it for 2020. 🤞

As I mentioned on my previous review, I keep one freelance job, which is almost
a personal project to me. I like to improve the app and make it better. I don't
have freelance gigs, but this one I'm happy to keep. Here is the time I tracked
about it this year (based on toggle, not totally accurate):

[![Chart for time working in my freelance job](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-freelance.png "Chart for time working in my freelance job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-freelance.png "")

June was an outlier as I did the migration of the application to a different
infrastructure in one weekend. It was an exception, because I don't work on
weekends most of the time. As it was my idea to do this migration, it was
personal to me. This migration project was the topic of my two presentations
this year, as I knew it would be an interesting topic to talk about.

Other than that, I usually don't work more than 20 hours a month for them. I
reserve some time every week day to work on different things. This project is
usually the first in the list, but sometimes I just don't want to work on it
and decide to use my time for other things (tech-related or not).

What I wrote on my 2017 Year in review still holds:

```
I really like my full-time job (more than ever!) but I like to do different
projects without constraints, it can be this freelance job or other activities
that also bring me joy.
```

I have a metric for the **time I spent doing/planning my talks** this year:

[![Chart for my time doing/planning presentations](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-presentation.png "Chart for my time doing/planning presentations")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-presentation.png "")

June was a busy month, just because I decided it would be. :) I want to keep
track of presentations, writing on my blog, etc. because I can easily metric
how much I'm donating to the community. Sometimes, instead of working for my
freelance, I decide to write and publish something that may be useful for
someone. Sometimes I decide to create slides for my next presentation at a
local meetup. If I take the ~10 hours I dedicate for that and apply the hourly
rate I have for the freelance job, it's easy to measure how much I'm donating.
It may be useless for other people, but it's highly valuable for me.

I don't want any money in exchange, but it's important for people to know that
others are donating their time because they like to do it and because they
believe it's may be useful for someone else. I've been participating/organizing
communities for more than 10 years now and I know how easy it is for people to
take local meetugs and talks for granted as it is free and someone else is
taken care of it.

Moving along with the metrics, let's check what data
[rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) can provide regarding my
productivity. :)

Let's look at the productive and distracting hours for the entire year:

[![Rescuetime 2019 year in review metrics](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2019.png "Rescuetime 2019 year in review metrics")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2019.png "")

The metrics of 2018 were not posted last here but here are them for comparison:

[![Rescuetime 2018 year in review metrics](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2018.png "Rescuetime 2018 year in review metrics")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-2018.png "")

This is part of the [year in review](https://www.rescuetime.com/year-in-review/2019) provided by rescuetime. They also provide a chart with the categories I used the most:

[![Rescuetime 2018 year in review metrics](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "Rescuetime 2018 year in review metrics")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "")

The dashboard shows similar information but with some other things:

[![Rescuetime 2019 year in review metrics](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png "Rescuetime 2019 year in review metrics")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category-dashboard.png "")
[![Rescuetime 2019 year in review metrics](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-goals.png "Rescuetime 2019 year in review metrics")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-goals.png "")

I had a lot more productive hours than I had in 2017 or 2018 and this is a good thing. :)

## Music

Again, [last.fm](https://last.fm) did a great year in review for me, so let's
check some stats here.

[![Songs scrobbled this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "Songs scrobbled this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "")
[![Listening stats for this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png "Listening stats for this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png "")
[![Listening percentiles compared to the user base](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png "Listening percentiles compared to the user base")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png "")
[![Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-discovery.png "Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-discovery.png "")

I'm using [Google Music](https://music.google.com) for two years now, so I was
already expecting to nto not have 500%+ on my Discovery as I had in 2017. My
Discovery this time is mostly related to Pops Staples, which is awesome BTW.

As usual, I'm listening to a **lot of Heavy and Threash metal, along with a lot
of Soundtracks, which is mostly Howard Shore** (no news here).

In 2017, I listened more to music between 20 nad 21 and how it changed between
10 and 11. I believe it's because I changed even more my routine to be even
more a morning person. I usually use music to focus or to create the mood for
the day, so it would make sense.

I have no idea why Thursday is a big outlier this year. Maybe because I'm
afraid about the end of the week and I'm using music to concentrate to deliver
everything I postponed during Monday, Thuesday, and Wednesday? LOL

[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix) also provided data about the
songs I listened to (via Last.fm):

[![Songs scrobbled this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-exist.png "Songs scrobbled this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-exist.png "")

This is the piece of information I was missing from Last.fm, so it's nice to
see it here 😃.

## TV Shows

I had a topic for TV shows in 2017 and I'm just realizing how this is not a
priority for me anymore. I'm not tracking the TV shows and I watch and I'm not
even watching that much anymore.

There are some TV shows that I watched and enjoyed though: **Game of Thrones**
(it's not about the end, but the journey) and **Vikings**. **Westworld S2** was
OK. There's also **Altered Carbon** I watched in 2018 that I enjoyed, the
concept is great.

To be honest, I don't even remember the ones I watched. I trid to use
[Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) but they don't provide your data if you're not
paying, so... whatever. I checked [TV
time](https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/10615776/profile) and it seems they are
adding movies to the app, so maybe I will start using it again, since the app
is great.

## Physical data

In 2017 I had a hard time to come up with the metrics for my Phisical
activities and it seems things did not improve in the past two years. Someone
may say I should buy the expensive band X or the super expensive hardware Y,
but please don't. I prefer a simple and inexpensive device that tracks and
sends the data to other places.

Getting back to what I have. Now I can't get many bars on screen no miband and
they only provide a monthly summary, not an early one. Google fit is not very
helpful as well:

[![Number of steps from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps1.jpg "Number of steps from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps1.jpg "")
[![Number of steps from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps2.jpg "Number of steps from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps2.jpg "")
[![Number of steps from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps3.jpg "Number of steps from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps3.jpg "")

My savior this time will be [Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix),
because they have monthly averages:

[![Exist steps](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-exist.jpg "Exist steps")](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-exist.jpg "")

It's just an average, not the full number of steps, but it's good enough. I
don't need the total number of steps by year, as my goal is just to understand
if I'm walking enough, and I don't need a precise number for that.

Google location timeline gave me some yearly numbers about walking and public transportation:

[![Maps](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity.png "Maps")](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity.png "")
[![Maps](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity2.png "Maps")](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-activity2.png "")

It's nice to see I walked more than 800km this year. **April was the month I
had more steps** and it was probably because of my vacations in Portugal 🇵🇹.

### Weight

I tracked my weight this year as well, here is the data I have:

[![Weight](/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg "Weight")](/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-google-fit.jpg "")
[![Weight](/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-miband.jpg "Weight")](/images/stats/2019/yir/weight-miband.jpg "")

There's some data missing from January to May, but after that I took the Gym
and diet seriously, so we can clearly see how things start to improve.

When I got back from vacations (October), I was ready for some improvement
again and I lose more weight. Weight doesn't mean much as there are many other
important things to track. In my case, I know it was not just weight, I have
better muscles than last year and feel much better as well.

### Sleep

Again, the Miband app is not very useful:

[![Amount of sleep from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep1.jpg "Amount of sleep from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep1.jpg "")
[![Amount of sleep from June to October](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep2.jpg "Amount of sleep from January to October")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep2.jpg "")

I sync the same data with Google fit and connect it to
[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix). Those two services provide
some good visualizations of my data:

[![Amount of sleep from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg "Amount of sleep from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-google-fit.jpg "")
[![Amount of sleep from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-exist.jpg "Amount of sleep from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-exist.jpg "")

I finished reading [Why We
Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435182291) in July and I was
curious to see how changing my routine influenced my sleep. I was expecting to
have more immediate impact on August or September, but I can see **I only had
real impact after September**. :)

I'm also using the [Sleep as
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&hl=en)
app to get some sleep data. I connect it to my miband and let it track. Here is
the data I was able to extract from the app:

[![](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg "")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-stats.jpg "")
[![](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg "")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype.jpg "")

I'm a Morning lark. I usually work better in the morning and go to sleep
earlier. The average duration of my sleep is a bit low in this app for some
reason, but it's usually between 7h and 7h30m.

The Efficiency is the time I'm in bed but actually sleeping not browsing the
internet or having problems to sleep. 93% is a good value.

[![](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg "")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-deep-sleep.jpg "")
[![](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg "")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-irregularity.jpg "")

My deep sleep is decreasing in the past months for some reason, I have to
improve this situation. I believe the decrease of deep work is happening
because of my habit of looking at my cellphone before sleeping. I will try to
cut the cellphone at night again.

My irregulatiry of sleep is also not good, I should have close to no
irregularity of sleep. I hope to improve that until the middle of the year,
after that I can't promise anything. 😉

[![](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg "")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-chronotype-wakeup.jpg "")
[![](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg "")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-android-fall-asleep-hour.jpg "")

It's interesting to see that I usually wake up later and sometimes sleep more
when it's "free days" (holidays and weekend), but most of the time I eep the
same duration. The time I go to sleep is also clearly related to the duration
on the second chart. I believe this is pretty common since I have a time to
wake up but not a time to go to sleep. I'm aware of the problem already and I
hope to improve it.

I'm happy with the sleep data I have and I have to say I'm curious about the
data I will have about that next year.

## Words written and errors

This year I didn't have the data to consolidate and I don't want to check every
weekly email to consolidate it. Grammarly will have to do better if they want
their customers to get better data about their writings. Sorry Grammarly,
weekly emails are not enough.

This is the data I have from the last email I received before my vacations in
December:

[![Grammarly data for this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly.png "Grammarly data for this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly.png "")
[![Grammarly data for this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly2.png "Grammarly data for this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly2.png "")

We can see that I wrote almost 1.5MM words since I started. I checked the first
time Grammarly sent this number and it was 963,838 words written in Feb 11th.
Let's do a simple math:

```
1478380 - 963838 = 514542   -- words written between Feb and Dec
514542 / 10 = 51424 -- words by month (Feb -> Dec)
```

It seems **I write around 50k words every month**. It would be **around 600k works
a year**. 🙂

I would love to have a chart like [the one I had in
2017](/post/2017-year-in-review/) so I could see what errors I had and so on
but it's not viable, unfortunately. 😕

## Locations

In 2018, I went to **Chile** and the **USA**. In 2019, I went to **Uruguay**,
the **USA**, and **Portugal**.

Here is the summary of the year and all-time data by Google:

[![General data](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general.png "")
[![General data](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general2.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general2.png "")

I have to say that I'm very proud of myself when I see the all time data. I
believe that getting to know other places and cultures is something that
expands your mind in many ways. :)

Here are some of the cities and places I visited this year:

[![General data](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places.png "")
[![General data](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places2.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-places2.png "")

I'm quite satisfied with my trips in 2019.

## Expenses

I would love to do a deep analysis on this topic but unfortunately,
the apps I use do not provide an easy way of doing this. The only
thing I got was this chart for the last 6 months:

[![Expenses by category in the last 6 months](/images/stats/2019/yir/expenses.png "Expenses by category in the last 6 months")](/images/stats/2019/yir/expenses.jpg "")

The legend in the left is not so good because I had to remove the
actual values in cash to keep the percentages only. 🙄

Looking into this chart I can see that "Viagem" (travel) took almost
35% of my expenses. I tend to live a frugal life, so it makes sense to
have my travel expenses taking most part of my money spent. For me,
traveling is an investment and I don't regret spending money on it.

It bothers me that "Compras" (general spending) is the second category
of my expenses. I was expecting to have "Mercado" (groceries) here or
maybe "Bares / Restaurantes" (eating out), but not "compras". I will
look closely at it this year because it's an yellow flag for my
expenses.

Regarding my savings, it **increased by 16.83%** this year,
considering the value I had at the end of April (I don't have data for
Jan, Feb, and March). It's an **average of 2.10%** for each month, so
if we apply that for January, February, March, and April, **we would
have 25.25%**. In the end of the year, I had 75.10% of my savings goal.

Considering that I did not receive any payment in the last 6 months,
it's **really great**! I'm already expecting for a huge increase in my
savings for January when I received the payment for the work in the
last months. 😃


## Time to write this blog post

Phew... finally finished this one. 😅

This time I could track the whole process and **it took 10h15min to write this
blog post**.

[![](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-writing-time.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-writing-time.png "")

I can say the same thing I said in 2017: It totally worth my time
to write this. We have so many good insights when reviewing the data we
collected. 😌


## Conclusion

I have nothing to complain about 2018 and 2019. The only thing I should have
done earlier is the year in review for 2018 because it totally changes my mood
about what I did. It's great to do reviews because you can clearly see (at
least it's the case for me) that you did what you wanted to do in the general
context.

It's clear to me that doing my year in review in 2017 helped to improve things
I could only see when looking in "bird's eye view". Some things are not so
noticeable when you're seeing them in context, but they become clear when you
put them in a yearly context.

I'm sure 2020 will be an year full of huge challenges for me, but I'm also
curious to see the data I'm going to collect this year! 😉
