**Brace yourselves, as any other stats post, this one will be HUGE**

My year in review for 2018 was never posted because I could never finish it. I
don't want to let the same thing happen this year, so here I am.

The end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was quite hard for me and I just
didn't have the energy to sit down in front of the computer during the weekends
to write my monthly reviews.

[![Failed attempts to write my stats posts](/images/stats/2019/yir/blog-stats-failed.png "Two stats blog posts as drafts, never finished")](/images/stats/2019/yir/blog-stats-failed.png "")

Some people still ask me to get back to write such reviews, but I couldn't make
this a priority for myself anymore. I don't want the same to happen to my Year
in review. I do it for many year already and I plan to keep doing it for a long
time. So **let's start**!

## Books

[![Year in books](/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads-year-in-books-logo.png "A logo of my avatar with 'My year in books' written")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix "")

Although I did not meet my goal of 30 books read this year, I still consider
the 25 books read an achievements.

At some point I realized I was choosing my books to meet the goal. When picking
a new book from my wishlist, I was chosing the smallest ones first, not
necessarily the ones I wanted to read the most. It's not that bad, as I was
still chosing books from my library and wish list, but I don't want to have
such influence in the titles I pick.

25 books is a great mark IMO. You can see my 2019 Goodreads challenge
[here](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge). :)

I'm still using [Google keep](https://keep.google.com) to take notes of all the
books I read and I'm posting Goodreads reviews for them based on these notes.
You can see the reviews for 2019 by clicking on the books [on
Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14901302).

Here are the books from this year's list that I really recommend
reading, with links to my review:

* [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435182291)
* [Homo Deus](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055385130)
* [The Power of Habit](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1559101465) (second time I read this one)
* [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2606595802)
* [Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1601212243)

There are also some from 2018, since I did not post my Year in review last
year:

* [When](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2254843906)
* [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055385224)
* [A Guide to the Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2355647662)
* [Principles](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2479523573)

You can always look for my whole
[list of books read in 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2019) and [2018](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2018) on Goodreads.

Here are some stats provided by Goodreads comparing all the books I
have registered:

[![List of books read by year](/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads.png "List of books read by year")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

I started [listening to audiobooks](/post/audiobooks/) in 2016 and we can
clearly see how excited I was. üòÖ I can see now that I'm reducing the number of
books I'm reading every year, but I don't think I should be concerned by that.
The number of books should not surpass the quality of books and how much I'm
applying what I learn.

Let's compare the books I read this year with last year:

[![Comparison between 2017, 2018, and 2019](/images/stats/2019/yir/goodreads-details.png "Comparison between 2017, 2018, and 2019")](https://www.goodreads.com/pothix
"")

I used the number of pages because it clearly shows that I even read more than
2018, but not more books. I was not expecting that but it shows that I was
trying to be less focused on the number of books.

In 2017, I mentioned that I was disappointed with the number of 5 stars I gave.
It was probably related with the fact that I was buying cheaper books and
focusing on smaller ones as well. In 2018, I tried to fix that and it works.
I gave **7 five stars reviews** in 2018 and **five** in 2019. It seems these
metrics were useful after all. :)

In 2018, I read 2 books from my "audible-deal" shelf and in 2019 I read none.
From all the books I have on my "audible-deal", none of them were 5 stars. This
is probably a bad sign. On the other hand, I found some great books there and I
don't regret reading them
([Spaceman](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1968545292), [Rendezvous with
Rama](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2057742804), [What Doesn't Kill
Us](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2055058923), etc.).

I was not feeling so good about the number of books I read this year, but after
writing this section I'm feeling much better. I'm happy with my results here. :)

## Articles

I couldn't finish my year in review for 2018, but the part about articles was
done, fortunately. There's no way to get the read date from pocket, so if I
want to collect it, I have to do it from time to time. Thanks past self! It was
not in vain after all. If you're reading this, I was successfully to publish
this post this time, so this is good news. ü§û

Different from [the review I did for 2017](post/2017-year-in-review/), I will
now have data for the full year. I will also mention the data I had for 2018,
since they were collected but never published.

In 2018, I had **1733 articles unread (22% increase comparing to 2017) and 1456
articles read (31% increase comparing to 2017)**.

In 2019, I have **1908 articles unread (9% increase comparing to 2018) and 1731
articles read (16% increase comparing to 2018)**.

It means that **I read 275 article this year**. It's a bit worse than 2018,
when I read 381, but it's still a good number IMO. It's an average of **23
articles each month**.  Again, it's worth mentioning that I'm aware that I will
probably wever read all those 1908 articles left in my Pocket account and I'm
OK with that.

I was expecing to have more data from
[Exist.io](https://exist.io/?referred_by=pothix) this year, but unfortunately,
it was a bit disappointing to not have much. They provided a year in review,
which I'm going to mention later, but the only thing about articles is that **it
says I read 263**, which is quite close to the number I had above. :)

## Coding

All my coding metrics are provided by
[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix). When we have a light blue bar inside
a dark blue one, it means the light one is the global average and the dark one
is the top coder. We should usually focus on the **light blue part of the bar**.

First, let's take a look at the total time coding:

[![Total time coding this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png "Total time coding this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

My daily average this year is even lower than the 1h31 per day I got on 2017,
which looks really low for me. I'm still above the average, but 47 mins in
average is a bit weird. üòê

I remember the official Wakatime profile [added a comment to my 2017
post](post/2017-year-in-review/) to mention that it may be related to the way
Wakatime records the numbers. I remember tweaking things a bit but I'm not sure
if I should increase the numbers to have unrealistic reports. Maybe I should
try to tweak the data collection once again.

[![Total time coding by project this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png "Total time coding by project this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I dedicated only 22 hours to this blog, compared to 80+ in 2017. I would like
to improve this, but I'm not sure if it will be a priority, unfortunately.

[Todoist](https://todoist.com) is my top project for this year, which is
expected since it's my main job. I expected to have more time tracked there,
but I'm not only coding for the main Todoist repository, so it makes sense. I
hope to also have [Twist](https://twist.com) as a relevant project on my lsit
of projects next year, or at least have integrations related to it.

I still keep the same freelance job I have for more than 4 years now. It became
almost a personal project for me. The good parts of working for them is that
the work is just coding and mostly bugs. I just need to sit down and write some
code when I feel like.

This year was totally atypical, since I took some time to migrate their
framework from one version to another. It was a big challenge, especially for
someone working using their spare time for that. I expect the number of hours
working on this project to totally shrink in 2020. Let's see.

[![Total time coding by editor this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png "Total time coding by editor this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

I'm just using Linux, so it's expected to have it here. I'm using it much more
than the average as we can see. The "top coder" is an outlier for sure. üòú

In 2017, I wrote: _Looks like I fully switched to Emacs_. It seems thhings have changed again. I'm back to Vim now. üôÇ

[![Total time coding by language this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png "Total time coding by language this year")](https://wakatime.com/@PotHix "")

Markdown is still in this list for the same reasons I had in 2017:

* I still write posts on my blog using Markdown
* I'm responsible for [Todoist](https://developer.todoist.com)
  and [Twist](https://developer.twistapp.com) documentation
* I usually write long post in Emacs/Vim and then paste them to Twist

There's no surprise that **Python** is the language I used the most this year,
since we use Python for almost everything at Doist.

I use Ruby at my freelance job, so there's no surprise to still have it there.

In 2017, I mentioned that _I don't think I will have enough ground to play with
Elixir this year but maybe Rust will have his time in my schedule in 2018._ It
was true about Elixir, unfortunately, but I had an improvement for Rust ü¶Ä. I
even [had my first change merged into the
compiler](https://pothix.com/post/contributing-to-rust/)! The change itself was
quite simple, but it was great to understand how to contribute and hopefully
new contributions will come this year!

### Speaking

After 2017, I had a hangover of speaking. üòÖ

For those of you who remember, I spoke 24 times in 2017. I decided to create
some sort of a challenge for myself to speak more and was quite successful at
it. It was time to have a low schedule. üòÉ

To make things easier to track, I now have the [talks page](/talks), which I'm
going to use as a reference here.

+ **In 2018, I spoke 7 times with 6 different presentations. 6 different
presentations delivered in pt-BR and one of them delivered in English.**
+ **In 2019, I spoke 2 times and both were the same presentation. I spoke at the
local Ruby meetup and brought that same (sligthly changed) presentation to
Rubyconf Brasil.**

We can clearly see that I'm slowing down my pace of presentations. I came from
24 presentations in 2017, to 7 in 2018, to 2 in 2019. That's exactly what I
wanted to do. I have to say that I was already feeling bad to not be speaking
for some time and I was eager to speak in 2019. üòÖ I don't think things are
change much for 2020 though.

Last year I was also on stage, but not delivering a talk. I was one of the core
organizers of Rust LATAM, the first big conference about Rust in Latin America.
It was a great experience and you can read more about it
[here](/post/how-was-rust-latam-2019/).


### Completed tasks

Every year Todoist releases an astonishing Year in review. Here is mine from
[2017](https://todoist.com/review/2017/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJ1QWNKZHhCQyIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxN30.zJQ9q-v1pyL1HwerqktZyNMLSwC7RxC0CKHUNdkoZQI),
[2018](https://todoist.com/review/2018/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJFaklzQ3BBeiIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOH0.2EMtZYiOkn8QjLUZjfgccy5ZUyfYtV5uGHfGgDSU1lQ),
and now
[2019](https://todoist.com/review/2019/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJmeU1mckJqdSIsInVpZCI6NTA1NDQ0MywieWVhciI6MjAxOX0.HwRgJULd8lDN6FjCC5tcrMYVegrXQCk_X6D713bV14E),
which is the one we're going to explore.

Let's check my Todoist tasks! üôÇ

[![Tasks completed on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png "Tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png "")
[![Average of tasks completed on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed2.png "Average of tasks completed on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed2.png "")

It's a it less than what I expected since I completed 6323 tasks in 2018. It's
not a huge problem because it always depends on how you organize your task
manager. In my case, I also have my routine on my task manager so it can help
me to actually do the things I plan for myself. The plan for 2020 is to remove
my routine from Todoist and move it to my calendar, so I can only have the
important tasks there. By removing these tasks from Todoist, I will probably
have a report with less tasks next year and that's OK. üôÇ

It looks like **Friday is the day I complete more tasks**:

[![Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png "Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed.png "")

I think it happens because I usually post my snippets every Friday, so I
complete the list of tasks I have to post there every Friday.

**My most productive time is 10:00** (not 16:00 as I had in 2017):

[![Tasks completed by time and postponed by time](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "Tasks completed by time and postponed by time")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png "")

I found it very interesting that the productivity chart correlates with my When
tracked (wrote about it on [my current productivity worklow 2019](/post/my-current-productivity-workflow/)):

![A sheet of paper with something that looks like a chart showing the times I feel more productive](/images/posts/productivity_dailywhentracker.png)

Let's see how those tasks are distributed throughout the year. You can clearly see my vacations on the light gray columns:

[![Tasks completed by day on my Todoist account](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "Tasks completed by day on my Todoist account")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-completed-by-day.png "")

I'm still one of the 1% heavy users of Todoist! üòÉ

[![Top 1% user of Todoist](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-top-1.png "Top 1% user of Todoist")](/images/stats/2019/yir/tasks-top-1.png "")

The data and design of our year in review is awesome. I did not participate on
the project this year (as I did in 2017), but proud of what we are able to
deliver. üéâ

### ‚úÖ Podcasts

[![Time listening to Podcasts this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "Time listening to Podcasts this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-time.jpg "")
[![Time listening by Podcasts](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-list.jpg "Time listening by Podcasts")](/images/stats/2019/yir/podcasts-list.jpg "")

Unfortunately, I don't have data about 2018 anymore, so I will just mention
2019 here.

If I was listening to the episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn't) it would
be equivalent to **18 days and 4 hours** of non-stop listening. As I usually
listen to Podcast in 2x or more (depending on many factors), I would say I
spent around 9 days listening to Podcasts, which is **effectively around 216
hours of my time**.

I usually listen to Podcast when I'm commuting, walking the dog, washing the
dishes, doing exercises, etc. I'm usually focusing on
[audiobooks](https://pothix.com/post/audiobooks/), but I listen to podcasts
between one book and another.

The list of podcasts shown here are actually my global list, not the yearly
one, unfortunately. I'm not even listening to new episodes of some of these
anymore, but they are still there.

## Hours working, focusing and distractions

Let's start checking all my data tracked using [Toggl](https://toggl.com):

[![Chart for time working in my full-time job](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-comparison.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

The gray bars are related to the data for 2018. I believe the changes are
related to my scheduled vacations. :)

Let's check my time working, considering my full-time job only:

[![Chart for time working in my full-time job](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-fulltime-job.png "Chart for time working in my full-time job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time.png "")

April was conference + retreat + vacations for me, so it's an outlier.
Considering 40 days of vacations during the year (national holidays are
considered vacations) and dividing the average of 151 hours a month by 18 (21
working days - 3 days of vacations per month) I have an average of 8 hours and
a half of work every day. At [Doist](https://doist.com), we recommend to not
work more than 8 hours a day, so I'm working a bit more but it's under control.

I spent 81 hours of my year in meetings. Most of them were weekly sync meetings
with my remote team and also a monthly 1-on-1 with the head of my team. I
consider all of those meetings productive. There was not a single meeting last
year where I found myself wasting my time, so this 81 hours are actually fine.

The most interesting part for me is the Shallow x Deep work ratio. I have
almost 3 times less time Deep working than Shallow working, which is not that
good. This is totally something I have to improve in 2020.

To give a bit more of context, I consider Deep work any work I can do without
distraction. Shallow work is the work I do while I have other tabs opened on my
browser or while I'm doing something else on the side.

I think I'm not tracking that as I should. Sometimes I'm focused on reading
Twist and answering questions, but as it's not coding, I consider it as shallow
work. I will certainly improve it for 2020. ü§û

Including my freelance job:

[![Chart for time working in my full-time and freelance job](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-plus-freelance.png "Chart for time working in my full-time and freelance job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-total-time-plus-freelance.png "")

It looks more even now but I don't know if it's a good thing. I don't
usually work as a freelancer but I work for 1 company for almost two
years now and I really like the challenges they have there, so I would
like to work for them again. To be able to do that, I have to
stabilize my workday.

From July to December I did almost no freelance work for this company:

[![Chart for time working in my freelance job](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-freelance.png "Chart for time working in my freelance job")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-freelance.png "")

**A goal for the next year is to work smarter not harder**, so I will have
more time to do other things not related to my full-time job. I really
like my full-time job (more than ever!) but I like to do different
projects without constraints, it can be this freelance job or other
activities that also bring me joy.

There's one metric that makes me feel great. I've been tracking the
amount of Deep work I do at work since the beginning of the year. I
consider something to be Deep work when I close all external
interruptions (Telegram, Slack, Email, Twist, Cellphone, etc) and
focus on the work I have to do. And for this year I have this:

[![Chart for my time Deep working](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-deepwork.png "Chart for my time Deep working")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-deepwork.png "")

What an **AMAZING** thing to see. I really like when I'm on the flow
state focusing on my task. That chart shows me that I was happier than
before. üôÇ

As I realized that it would not be possible to apply my deep work techniques in my previous job
I was applying that on my freelance work. If I add to the chart all
the freelance work I did for that company (features, bug busting,
infrastructure) we have this:

[![Chart for my time Deep working including my freelance](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-deepwork-plus-freelance.png "Chart for my time Deep working including my freelance")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-deepwork-plus-freelance.png "")

Which is not that bad. üôÇ

The good part is that I can apply Deep work to my full-time job
instead of look for a different place to use it. üéâ

I would love to track the time I spent in meetings comparing the first
semester and the second but I was not tracking it in the first
semester. Now, giving that a second thought, even if I tracked, it
would be more noise than signal. Sometimes you have productive
meetings and other times you have "meeting that need to be done" where
people keep talking about the unrelated stuff in the first 20 minutes
of the meeting to speak about the productive stuff after
that. So... `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`.

I also have a metric for the **time I spent doing/planning my talks**
this year:

[![Chart for my time doing/planning presentations](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-presentation.png "Chart for my time doing/planning presentations")](/images/stats/2019/yir/toggl-presentation.png "")

Sometimes I did not track it at all, especially in the beginning of the
year, but it's worth mentioning as well. In April and June, I was
practicing for my live-coding session. üôÇ

I'm also using [rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570) to
track my productivity. I'm not sure if my configuration is good and I
keep changing them, so these metrics may not be so accurate. A good
example of that is my tracking time, I'm also tracking the time at
night when I'm talking to friends via Telegram or over the weekend.

Let's look at the productive and distracting hours for the entire
year:

[![Rescuetime metrics for productive and distracting hours](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-productive-hours.png "Rescuetime metrics for productive and distracting hours")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-productive-hours.png "")
[![Rescuetime metrics for the category that took most of my time](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "Rescuetime metrics for the category that took most of my time")](/images/stats/2019/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png "")

A lot of distracting hours. As it considers my weekends and nights, I
don't think it's accurate. It still bothers me that "communication &
scheduling" is the most used category. I will change that this year.

### Music

I usually don't talk about music but [last.fm](https://last.fm) did a
good "year in review" for me, so I will add some stats here.

[![Songs scrobbled this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "Songs scrobbled this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png "")
[![Listening stats for this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png "Listening stats for this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png "")
[![Listening percentiles compared to the user base](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png "Listening percentiles compared to the user base")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png "")
[![Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-discovery.png "Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/lastfm-discovery.png "")

I started using the paid version
of [Google Music](https://music.google.com) this year, that explains
why my "Discovery" has an increase of "558%" this year. I also almost
doubled the number of artists I listened this year.

Some interesting statistics are related to the time I listened to more
songs. It seems that I listen to more songs between 20:00 and
21:00. It's usually when I want to do something different and need
more energy. Wednesday is the day I listen to more music, I have no
idea why it's so different than the rest. ü§î

And the obvious part... I listen to metal most of the time. üòú


### TV Shows

I will use my [tvshowtime](https://www.tvshowtime.com) stats to get
some data about it. Here are my data for January and December:

[![TV shows watched in January](/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched in January")](/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg "")
[![TV shows watched in December](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "TV shows watched in December")](/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg "")

Based on that (and ignoring how much I watched in January) I can get
to the conclusion that **I watched 241 episodes**, more than 4
episodes a week.

Let's imagine that tvshowtime uses 30 days for one month. In this
case, **I spent 8 days and 5 hours of my year watching TV shows**.

As I don't usually watch TV, I will consider that 1 week and half of
my entire year was spend watching TV. It's 2% of all my time spent
with TV, not sure if it's good enough.


### Physical activity

I was expecting to have an easy work on this one since I have some
apps for metrics but turns out that it's not so easy to retrieve
yearly information. üòû

What I did to get the information I need was to look month by month
and take screenshots on my cell phone. I'm not including November and
December because December is truncated in the monthly view for some
reason and it would be too much work to include November alone. It was
not so easy or pleasant to get that but here is the data regarding my
steps:

[![Number of steps from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-jan.jpg "Number of steps from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-jan.jpg "")
[![Number of steps from June to October](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-jun.jpg "Number of steps from June to October")](/images/stats/2019/yir/steps-jun.jpg "")

Nothing so unusual. It was mostly stable and I had peaks in February
and October, the two months I was traveling to Europe.

Regarding my sleep:

[![Amount of sleep from January to May](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-jan.jpg "Amount of sleep from January to May")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-jan.jpg "")
[![Amount of sleep from June to October](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-jun.jpg "Amount of sleep from January to October")](/images/stats/2019/yir/sleep-jun.jpg "")

Looks like my deep sleeping (the dark purple) increased in the second
semester. It's interesting because it correlates with the dates I
started in my new job at Doist. In February, when I was not working, I
had a good rate of deep sleeping as well, I will assume it was stress
related to my previous job.

In general, it looks good to me.

### ‚úÖ Words written and errors

After consolidating all the data I collected from Grammarly this year
I have the following:

[![Grammarly data for this year](/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly.png "Grammarly data for this year")](/images/stats/2019/yir/grammarly.png
"")

I just copied and pasted all the data from all posts into a Google
Spreadsheets and generated a chart, no science here. January,
February and March have no data, unfortunately.

The interesting metric I can get from this chart is that I'm writing a
lot more and the *corrections made* are not increasing at the same
pace. This is really great to see. üòÉ

Unique words are stable since I started tracking my words. Looks like
my vocabulary is not increasing but I think it's normal, we usually
don't use difficult words in our day-to-day life.

### ‚úÖ Locations

This year was amazing regarding traveling. I went to Belgium,
Netherlands, Scotland, England, Portugal, Spain, and visited many
different cities. I'm planning some posts about those cities for a
while now, maybe someday.

In one of those trips I had a goal to speak with people from other
countries and had long conversations with people from Germany, Poland,
Spain, Scotland, Colombia, Canada, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Japan,
Brazil, Uruguay, Australia, Russia, Ireland, Portugal, India, Belgium,
Bosnia, France, Argentina, and Netherlands. It was really great. üòÄ

Now that you know about the trips, I don't know if I can trust the
data provided by Google Locations. Take your own conclusions:

Unfortunately, I don't have my data for January, the first record was
in February (after visiting more than 13 cities in 4 countries):

[![General data for February](/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png "")

And this is the data for December:

[![General data for December](/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png "General view of my locations data")](/images/stats/2019/yir/location-general.png "")

It doesn't look so different even with all those travels. Considering
that I visited Porto, Lisbon, and Barcelona in October, it doesn't
make any sense. üòû

I use Google maps and Google trips to find new places to go. I'm
a [Google maps local guide](https://maps.google.com/localguides) and I
usually add reviews to the map. As a side-effect of that, I have stars
in almost all places I go.

[![My Google maps in Europe](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-europe.png "My Google maps in South America")](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-europe.png "")
[![My Google maps in South America](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-south-america.png "My Google maps in South America")](/images/stats/2019/yir/maps-south-america.png "")

I hope to have many other stars soon. :)

According to
[matadornetwork](https://matadornetwork.com/travel-map/22396bbf7ad1af6c0d8758cb54077e13-1515270907),
I visited 8 countries so far:

### ‚úÖ Expenses

I would love to do a deep analysis on this topic but unfortunately,
the apps I use do not provide an easy way of doing this. The only
thing I got was this chart for the last 6 months:

[![Expenses by category in the last 6 months](/images/stats/2019/yir/expenses.png "Expenses by category in the last 6 months")](/images/stats/2019/yir/expenses.jpg "")

The legend in the left is not so good because I had to remove the
actual values in cash to keep the percentages only. üôÑ

Looking into this chart I can see that "Viagem" (travel) took almost
35% of my expenses. I tend to live a frugal life, so it makes sense to
have my travel expenses taking most part of my money spent. For me,
traveling is an investment and I don't regret spending money on it.

It bothers me that "Compras" (general spending) is the second category
of my expenses. I was expecting to have "Mercado" (groceries) here or
maybe "Bares / Restaurantes" (eating out), but not "compras". I will
look closely at it this year because it's an yellow flag for my
expenses.

Regarding my savings, it **increased by 16.83%** this year,
considering the value I had at the end of April (I don't have data for
Jan, Feb, and March). It's an **average of 2.10%** for each month, so
if we apply that for January, February, March, and April, **we would
have 25.25%**. In the end of the year, I had 75.10% of my savings goal.

Considering that I did not receive any payment in the last 6 months,
it's **really great**! I'm already expecting for a huge increase in my
savings for January when I received the payment for the work in the
last months. üòÉ


### Time to write this blog post

Well, this one took some time. üòú

I started it on the airplane, coming back from York. Unfortunately, I
lost my tracking because of a software problem but I doubt I spent
less than 2 hours on it, so let's consider 2 hours.

After that I worked for 07h15min more, so we have **9h15min to write
this blog post** and it worth it, for sure.


### Conclusion

What a great year! :)

It is the first time I have that so much metrics to play with. I could
get some interesting information about how was my year and how some
changes influenced my behavior for good or bad.

It took a lot more time than I was expecting but I hope to have an
automated way to do that in the next year.

I achieved almost all of my goals last year, so I don't have anything
to complain. Hope that this year become even better than the last one.
