**TL;DR**: When traveling to Europe, I decided to take 2 or 3 days to visit
Oxford. I will describe how was the experience of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan there.

I'm a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien. Have read most of his books, the ones released
when he was still alive and other edited by Christopher Tolkien.

After attending [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) I decided to travel around some
countries in Europe and UK. The most expensive part, the airplane tickets
(Brazil -> Europe), were already paid, so... why not? :)

The last step of this journey would be London. Then I realized: "Why not to
visit Oxford?". It's a historical city and Tolkien himself wrote most part of
his books there.

I used Oxfordbus company as transport from Heathrow Airport to Oxford center. I
choose a cozy house to say via Airbnb for 3 days and 2 nights.

Everything in Oxford closes really early. I got there around 4pm and there was
nothing to do anymore. I tried to visit the Bodleian Library, but it was
closing. All colleges were closed. The only thing to do is to look for a place
to eat.

The first stop for real was Eagle and Child. This was the pub where the Inklings
met once a week in the morning. For those who don't know the Inklings, it was a
small group which J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were members. They used to talk
about their books in these meetings. The Lord of the Rings had their first
drafts showed in this pub, probably. It's a good place to eat, I liked it.

I was lucky to be in Oxford in a Wednesday, they have extended tours around the
Bodleian Library and Radcliff camera on Wednesdays and Saturdays. There were
some good stories about it, but unfortunately it's almost impossible for a
tourist to see any of the Tolkien's manuscripts or original materials. In order
to get access to it you need to have the Readers card. In order to obtain it,
you have to pay and justify *why* you need to have access to the them. So... No
manuscripts for me.

The guide of the Bodleian Library did not know anything about Tolkien, just the
history behind the Radcliff camera and the Bodleian Library. The extended tour
is expensive (£24, I think) but worth the price.

I went to the Weston Library, where they have a treasury room with a free
exposition. There I found a original drawing from Tolkien. But the other
manuscripts were already removed because they are planning to close this
exposition (as they said...).

Tolkien was a teacher at Merton College, you have to pay £4 to enter there if
you want to. After asking about Tolkien places to visit, I found that none of
the places I would like to visit in there were open to the public.

From the inside I could see (through the gate...) the rounded table that may
have inspired the meeting that created the fellowship of the ring.

I got this picture thanks to my 55-250mm lens, but it is not so close from the
gate. To enter there you have to be a Merton associate (or something like
that). But is still a good place to visit.

I decided to visit Magdalen College (£5) to walk in the "Addison's Walk" where
the Inklings talked about religion and where C.S Lewis was converted to
Christianity. Unfortunately, the wind was causing some threes to fall down and
they had to close the place for security reasons.

There was a exposition in the old library of the Magdalen College and it was
cool to see the old books. From the times they still had chains in the shelves. :)

There is a good place to find Tolkien books, in case you're interested. Go
to
[Blackwell Bookshop](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Blackwell's+Bookshop/@51.7545513,-1.2554288,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x998ba5c1ca8ff22f!2sBlackwell's+Bookshop!8m2!3d51.7546524!4d-1.2555315!3m4!1s0x0:0x998ba5c1ca8ff22f!8m2!3d51.7546524!4d-1.2555315) and
look for the shelf dedicated to J.R.R Tolkien.

In the last day, I decided to go to the cemetery where Tolkien was buried
(Wolvercote cemetery). It's not so far, but almost 1 hour walking. There are
some buses that take you there easily, just go to the bus station to get
information. I like to walk around the cities I visit, so we went there walking.

It's a simple tombstone, nothing spectacular, but I'm glad to get there.

Then we came back walking and passed in front of the house he lived with his
family for some time.

### Other things around Oxford

You're already in Oxford, so I recommend you to visit the Blenheim Palace. It's
expensive £23 (go by bus and buy the tickets on the bus because it's cheaper
than buying there) but worth the price. It's not the Highclere Castle from
Downton Abbey, but some rooms were made me think about it. :)

Walk around the Carfax Tower and the Oxford castle. I liked both structures. The
interesting part about the Carfax Tower is that it is there since 900 a.c.

The architecture for all colleges is really impressive, just walk around them if
you like it. I'm a big fan of these kinds of architectures, so I enjoyed walking
around them and taking pictures (yes, I like photography too!).

### Conclusion about my Tolkien Tour

There are some other pictures related to Tolkien
in [this Google photos album](https://goo.gl/photos/U6T3zf66nwWAwi7G6).

I was expecting to see more materials from Tolkien. There were no expositions
about him, the only thing I saw was a drawing. I know that all (or at least,
many) of his manuscripts are available at the Bodleian Library, but they're not
accessible.

The city do not use the fact that Tolkien lived there as touristic
attraction. The only place referencing Tolkien was the Eagle and Child.

But Oxford is a good city to visit. There is a lot of history there. I just
recommend you, J.R.R. Tolkien fan, to align your expectations with what is
there.
