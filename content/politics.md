title = "Politics"

I usually don't talk much about politics, mostly because it usually do not worth
my time discussing it or because I want to keep all my public profiles tech
related (I don't care much if you think politics is everywhere BTW).

I wanted a page I can link to when someone asks about my perspective on
politics, so I decided to write this.

I currently live in Brazil and I think I current president is an idiot. Probably
the worse president we ever had and certainly not the president we need in the
middle of a pandemic.

I can't understand why so many people voted for him in the previous election. I
know people had a strong aversion for the previous party, but we had many other
canditates to be considered and he was still elected.

My political spectrum is probably around the center. If I had to choose left or
right (because people think everything is black or white), I would say I'm
leaning towards right.
