I usually don't talk much about politics, mostly because it usually do not worth
my time discussing it or because I want to keep all my public profiles tech
related (I don't care much if you think politics is everywhere BTW).

I wanted a page I can link to when someone asks about my perspective on
politics, so I decided to write this.

I currently live in Brazil and I think the current president do not act in good
faith. Probably the worse president we ever had and certainly not the president
we need in the middle of a pandemic.

I can't understand why so many people voted for him in the previous election. I
know people had a strong aversion for the previous party, but we had many other
canditates to be considered and he was still elected.

I strongly believe he is responsible for the hundreds of thousand of deaths we
had in Brazil due to COVID. We are the country with most deaths in 2020, even
comparing with countries with more population than us. He ignored vaccines,
usually says publicly it's not his faults or even paying respects for the dead.
If we had a decent president, I'm sure we would have saved many lives.

My political spectrum is probably around the center. If I had to choose left or
right (because people think everything is black or white), I would say I'm
leaning towards right. You don't have to be in the "left spectrum" so say the
current president is not worth a penny.
