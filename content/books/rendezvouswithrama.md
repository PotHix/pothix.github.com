Book: [Rendezvous with Rama (Rama, #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537) by Arthur C. Clarke. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

I tend to not read much science fiction but this is a great book.

I'm a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien because I love the way he used to build his world. I found Rama an amazing place where things work in a different way but following most of the same laws we have.

Arthur C. Clarke writes in a nice way, adding the exact number of details you need to feel immersed in the story without adding too much information.

I'm now curious about the other Rama books. üò¨
