Book: [Outliers: The Story of Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917) by Malcolm Gladwell. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It was a good reading. I would review this book as 3 stars but at the end, I was convinced that it made me think about many interesting things on successful people in general.

The key point of this book is: what makes successful people is a match of many factors. Some of those factors were not clear to me.

Cultural inheritance is one of those factors. Who were your ancestors? How they lived their life? They probably have some influence on how you lived yours.

Dedication is a key point. Many of the outliers present in this book's study had 10000+ hours of practice in their area before becoming successful.

Access to the right tools at the right time. To have a computer when most people in the world doesn't can make a huge difference on your success rate, for example. Bill gates is an example of that.

My expectation for this book was pretty high, that's the reason for the first sentence of this review, but *it is* a good book.

Here are my notes about the book:

- 10000 hours of practice. 3 hours a day for 10 years
- After 100-130 of IQ the difference doesn't matter
- Practical intelligent. Express your thoughts to others in a convincing way. Say what you have to say, in the right way and the right time
- Family background makes a lot of difference on the kid success. Access to books and education.
- Family, ability and personality to get a job. Who has more of these qualities have more chance of getting a job.
- Do a work that is meaningful
- Talent, Dedication and timing
- Success is the combination of many things. Being in the right moment, a dose of talent, a lot of dedication and opportunity. It's not some random thing.
- Cultural legacy matters. We can't make sense of the world without them
- PDI power distant industry. Low PDI tends do hide power to exercise it.
- Highest PDI in pilots were found in Brazil.
- Book "remember since" Chinese numbers in 2 seconds.
- Outliers are the result of a lot of work, luck, social context and many other things.
