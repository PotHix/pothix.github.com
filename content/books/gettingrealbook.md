Book: [Getting Real: The Smarter, Faster, Easier Way to Build a Web Application](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/447648) by 37 Signals. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

There are almost 10 years from this book release and the ideas are still valid for the software development industry that we have now.

Some of them can't be applied to big and established companies, but it shows why small companies can beat them if they know how to organize. "Divide and conquer" and "Do only what is needed" are the core of this book IMO.

This book is still inspiring for who that wants to create a new product (or improve the current ones) and it's less then 200 pages. Worth reading.
