Book: [At the Mountains of Madness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32767) by H.P. Lovecraft. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

The first H.P. Lovecraft book I read/listen and now I understand what people say from his descriptions.

It's interesting how he keeps the suspense until the last 5% of the book. The bad part is that it becomes boring sometimes. You want to understand was is there and why he doesn't want to talk about it but he keeps describing icy mountains and large rooms.

When I finished the book I started listening to "The thing the should not be" from Metallica, because of the reference. :)
