Book: [Programming Phoenix: Productive |> Reliable |> Fast](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26871792) by Chris McCord. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It is a great book for web developers learning Elixir (yeah, not just Phoenix).

I'm on the path of playing with Elixir and was looking for a book to amplify my knowledge. I first started with Programming Elixir, from Dave Thomas but I was looking for something more practical.

I decided to try Programming Phoenix and found that it shows everything I need to know about Elixir to build a web application. For me, it was really great to start with this one. Now I know what needs to be done to build a web application and I can go back to programming Elixir to do a deep dive in the language.
