Book: [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11) by Douglas Adams. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

This book is amazing! There are some non-sense parts but in general, it makes you think about "life, universe, and everything".

There are some ideas that look so absurd in real life but make sense in the book context. If you're that kind of geek/nerd that likes physics (you don't need to be an expert, just an enthusiast) this book will be great.

The feeling is really different between the book and the movie, so if you just watched the movie (like I did before reading) I really recommend you to read the book before rating the story.
