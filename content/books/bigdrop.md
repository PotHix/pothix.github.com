Book: [The Big Drop: How To Grow Your Wealth During the Coming Collapse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26160453) by James Rickards. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

TL; DR - A lot of theories about the next economic crash, if you want to know some connections between gold, dollar and other different investments to protect you in case it happens, it may be a good book for you.

I'm Brazilian and some part of the economic context is not the same here, but there are some parts make totally sense. In case you like economy, or has some investments and want to understand some relationships, or just want to "be warned" about what may come in the future, this book would be good for you.
