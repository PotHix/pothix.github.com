Book: [Cesar Millan's Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939161) by Cesar Millan. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Nice book for those thinking about adopting a shelter dog and did not research it yet.

I adopted my dog from a local shelter, he was abandoned at the shelter door with his brothers as a puppy. He was 2 months old when we adopted him. I had to do some research in different sources and buy some e->

The book is not considering you're adopting a puppy, but most part of what it shows is still valid.

Here is my raw notes about the book:

- Introduce the dog calmly to everyone in the house
- Walk the dog at least two times a day, 45 minutes each
- Remember that you must be the leader always. The dog must be the follower.
- Be strict with your rules, you can change it later.
- Your comes and goes must not be a big deal.
- Audiobooks are good for the dog but you have to do it half an hour before leaving. Audiobooks should be related to a rest time, not departure.
- Vary your routine when walking, get to know your neighborhood
- Feed yourself first and then feed your dog, no begging at the dinner table
- Don't give a threat to your dog before he does the action or you will remove the incentive for the action
- Don't hug or squeeze your dog, it's not a natural sensation for them
- Don't give your dog affection when she is already super excited. They will enjoy it more when they are calm
- Always praise your dog after he did something good not before or without a reason or he will not understand
- The first days at the new home are the most important for your new dog. He will understand this is a new environment and will follow the rules if you teach in the right way
- It's possible to change the dog's name. Be consistent and use it many times
