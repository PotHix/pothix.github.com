Book: [On Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35049472) by Robert A. Caro. Rating: ⭐️⭐️.

Not that much to learn from this "book".

It's really small (almost two hours of audio) and looks like an abridged version of a collection of other books. I'm not American, so I'm not part of the context or his target audience and maybe it also plays some role here.

The whole thing about the electricity was a reality for my mom (and for me when I visited my grandparents as a child) in Brazil, it may be shocking to people living in New York nowadays but I already knew all of that in my own context.

The power examples of power were not so good as I expected, maybe because there is not so much time to tell a good story.

Maybe Caro has some good materials out there but I don't think this is one of them.
