Book: [A Study in Scarlet (Sherlock Holmes, #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102868) by Arthur Conan Doyle. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

A good book! I always wanted to read Sherlock Holmes books but never tried it. Thanks to BBC's Sherlock Series I decided to give it a try. The good part is that I could understand a lot of jokes that the TV show made and the differences from the 189x to 201x. :)

I really recommend you to read it if you like stories on investigation. By the way, watch the TV shows as well, both are awesome.
