Book: [The Future of the Professions: How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23462787) by Richard Susskind. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It is a nice idea and the arguments looks valid and make you think about the future.
The book is not easy to follow through and I the first 5 chapters are not so interesting. Most part of the book is an introduction to the main subject that is presented on the last chapters.

Here are my notes for this book:

- More people in our world have cellphones than teeth brusher
- We need to be experts to know to to seek an expert.
- Driverless car, doctorless patient, lawierless client
- Pay by value generated instead of hours worked. In the online market it will not make sense.
- We process more data than we get knowledge from.
- Mistification of professioes and complicated words being used to create a social closure.
- If you fold a paper X times you will have light years of size
- Coisas podem ser transformada em digital mas o objeto não. Industrial goods.
- Shoulders of giants
- We have more information than we crn manage with knowledge (number of drugs for a doctor)
- Network professionals - Remote team. They are not hired full time but by project.
- Knowledge engineering - expose information withiut content with a human being via online services
- Communities of experience - People sharing through systems like wikipedia. Less formal.
- Embedded model - proactive information in a machine
- Machine generated model - big data and AI develop the knowledge to solve a problem. Helps defining when to ask for help.
- Professions were created because we cant have sufficient knowledge to deal with all problems we have, so we ask people with pratical experience.
- A task that is so simple to a robot to do is benief the dignity of the human brain
- A ideia das profissões é levar conhecimento aos leigos e ajudá lis a resolver os problemas. É um meio, não um fim
- Machines will kill professions but open space for new tasks
