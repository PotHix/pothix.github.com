Book: [Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202) by Steven D. Levitt. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Nice book with really interesting statistics done in some sets of data. It remembers me about the whole "big data" trend that we have today.

In some parts it looks like the comparison of the global warming and the number of pirates (as my "Statistics One" professor and the book author used to say: "correlation does not imply causation"), but the whole idea behind the studies are really interesting. It is all about using creativity to find the "most right" data to understand what happened in the past.
