Book: [The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8695) by Douglas Adams. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Another great book from Douglas Adams. The idea behind the restaurant is really really interenting and the author does a great job to insert funny concepts behind the whole event.

There are some nice gotchas that make you laugh while reading, I really recommend it.
