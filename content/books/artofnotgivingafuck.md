Book: [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707) by Mark Manson. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It was good at the beginning but the end was too self-help for me.

I learned good things in this book and that's what matters for me.

Here are my raw notes about the book:

- Give a fuck about things you already have, not only what you want.
- We have a limited number of fucks to give, choose yours wisely.
- If you're giving a fuck to a lot of things is because you're lacking important things to give a fuck
- Everyone wants the good parts of life (playing in a band and being a rockstar) but nobody wants the difficult part (countless hours playing your guitar alone and working on band's marketing). Fail is the way forward.
- Your actions are guided by your values, think about them and define good values for your life.
- Set good metrics for yourself. The example of Dave Mustaine is really great. Mustaine is awesome but he always compares his band with Metallica. He may have better metrics than that.
- Take responsibility for your feelings. You can't control other people's feelings, but you can control your own.
- The point of democracy is to deal with people we don't like
- We don't praise enough  people we like and praise famous people that don't deserve it
- Michael Jordan failed multiple times so succeed
- Improve your values and your metrics. Your life will blow away, everything will change but you will feel better
- You can't control other people, but you can control your feelings
- You are wrong about everything. Question yourself whenever possible
- Fail is the way forward. Everyone talks about success but noone talks about the huge amount of failure to get there.
- Give yourself the chance to fail and improve. If you don't know what to do, try it anyway and the ideas will come to your mind.
- Traveling is a good way to grow. You will understand how people live with different values and are happy with that.
- Uma teoria sobre o porque das pessoas serem honestas na Russia é o comunismo. Lá você precisa acreditar nas pessoas e a honestidade é muito importante para o sistema. No capitalismo, se você se apresentar de outra forma, que não precisa ser honesta, talvez seja melhor para ganhar ou vender coisas.
