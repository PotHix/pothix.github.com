Book: [MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23014006) by Anthony Robbins. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I have mixed feelings about this one. I got some cool insights about financing and how I can improve my plant of financial freedom, but the book was repetitive most of the time.

When I started this book my feeling was: "Man, this may be one of the best books I read". Some time ago I was reading a lot of "soon you'll see" or even repeating what was said before. In the end of the book I read some self-help.

The last words were really cool, btw.

So... I will still keep it with four stars. It do not deserve three. :)
