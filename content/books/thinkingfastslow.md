Book: [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377) by Daniel Kahneman. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

The concept of system 1 (fast) and system 2 (slow) is really great.

For tech folks, the system 1 looks like a cache inside your head. It is the best way to explain it for tech related people, in my opinion.

There are dozens of serious research done to make this book happen. They were not made exclusively for the book, but it is really nice to read a book that has strong foundations.
