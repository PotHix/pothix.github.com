Book: [Leadership and Self-Deception: Getting Out of the Box](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180463) by The Arbinger Institute. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️.

It's a good book. Good information in a good narrative form.

This is a short book with an easy to follow narrative about leadership. There are not so many notes about this one, but here they are:

* See People as people, not objects
* Self-betrayal is an act in contrary of what I feel I should do for another person. i.e. when you want to hold the door but doesn't
* When I betray myself I enter in the box and start seeing the world in a way it justifies my self-betrayal, my view of reality becomes distorted
* With time we tend to carry boxes with us and see ourselves in some self-justifying images we created
* We don't see people as people but as objects. If they act in ways that don't justify the image we built, we see them as treats. If they act reinforcing the self-justifying image, we see them as allies. If they fail to matter as the self-justifying image we see them as unimportant.
* When you question your virtues and feelings you can get out of the box.

In summary, this book helps you think about your attitude towards other people and why you have some kinds of feelings in a specific situation. Sometimes it's better to rethink yourself to be able to understand the situation better.

I recommend everyone to read this book since it's a small and easy to read.
