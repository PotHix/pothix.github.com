Book: [A Jornada do Escritor: Estrutura mítica para escritores](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26809605) by Christopher Vogler. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

Essential reading for those who wants to write a book. I really like the way that Christopher explores movies like Titanic, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King. The examples of the Hero's journey based on this movie really helped me to understand the various archetypes and how they interact in each stage of the journey.

Just read it for the first time but I'm sure that I'll read it again soon and keep it on my desk for reference. :)
