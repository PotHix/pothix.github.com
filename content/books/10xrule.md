Book: [The 10x Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10339170) by Grant Cardone. Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

I really like this book. I would recommend it if you are the kind of person that
wants to make a difference in the world and want to be remembered in the future
generations. The book will not give you that but if you follow a methodology
like it recommends you will get closer to your big goals.

Here is my raw notes about the book:

- Always multiply your goal by 10. You will have to think differently about the problem when you do that. By having such a big goal, you will need to attack it with massive action.
- Don't worry about what the society thinks about you. Most people decided to be mediocre (part of the average people, and that's ok) and they will criticize you because you're not "living your life". Just remember that success is your duty.
- Fear is a good thing, it mean you're going to learn new things and conquer new places. Don't be afraid to do things.
- Forget about excuses, it will just give you a reason to "be on average". Instead of using excuses, do what have to be done.
- Don't be a victim. Will you add to your CV: "I am a programmer and part-time victim?". Will you teach your kids how to be a victim? So don't act like one.
- You are the problem and the solution
- Never change your goals for less in case you find that you are not ne able to reach them. There is no problem in no reaching your goals.
- Mass action. You will be weird for many people that are mediocre, but your efforts will totally worth it.
- Working for a burger company was not good for him. Not because of the money, but because it was not aligned with hes goals. A friend of his were just ok with the job, because it make sense for his future.
- Write down the people you know that live on average and the ones that are really good on what they do. What is the difference?
- Don't be competitive, be dominant
- Fear is a good thing. Be scared to not have fear of something
- Wake up! No one will save you. You must do it for yourself.
- There are no excuses. Do not use them. Make it happen. Car traffic? Leave earlier
- To do something big you have to take risks
- Have courage. Courage is for those who act
