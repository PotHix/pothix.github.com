I listen to podcasts since 2007 when I had to download them and transfer to my
AAA-battery powered MP3 player every day (ðŸ‘´). A lot changed since then, but I
still listen to podcast now and then.

I also used Podcasts to help with my listening to learn new languages, so you
will see different languages being listed here. ðŸ˜‰

Here is a list of the podcasts I recommend. By language and category:
