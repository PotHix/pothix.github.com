I listen to podcasts since 2007 when I had to download them and transfer to my
AAA-battery powered MP3 player every day (ðŸ‘´). A lot changed since then, but I
still listen to podcast now and then.

I also used Podcasts to help with my listening to learn new languages, so you
will see different languages being listed here. I will write everything in
English here and rely on Google Translate for the proper translation of
everything. ðŸ˜‰

Here is a list of the podcasts I recommend. By language and category:

## ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Portuguese

### 99 Vidas
**Category:** Gaming â€” **URL:** https://99vidas.com.br

It's mostly about old games and it's a topic I like a lot. Sometimes they
deviate a bit for some other nostalgia topic and I particularly skip these.

### Podquest
**Category:** GameDev â€” **URL:** https://podquest.com.br

Game developers working on AAA games. I really like the insights on the game
development career and the games' industry. They also do some reviews on games
released at the moment. It's a great podcast for those interested in game
development. Some episodes are even great for those not into gaming but into
software engineering.

### Dev na estrada
**Category:** Tech â€” **URL:** https://devnaestrada.com.br

General development talk and interview with developers. I like the way they make
episodes short and less formal. I had the [chance of being a guest on the
show](/media) and I really enjoyed the experience.

### Hipsters.tech
**Category:** Tech â€” **URL:** https://hipsters.tech

It's similar in content and format to Dev na estrada, but they don't do
interviews. I like their approach to content and had the [chance to participate
as a guest more than once](/media). I really recommend the show.

### Mauro Halfeld â€” CBN
**Category:** Money â€” **URL:** https://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm?podcast=87/cbn-dinheiro&ctarget=cbn-dinheiro-mauro-halfeld

Investment tips, daily brazilian economics and portfolio evaluation. It's very
conservative, but I like it anyway.

### Carlos Alberto Sarderberg â€” CBN
**Category:** Money â€” **URL:** https://cbn.globoradio.globo.com/servicos/podcast/PODCAST.htm?podcast=73/linha-aberta&ctarget=linha-aberta-carlos-alberto-sardenberg

Daily economics in Brazil. It's very short and brings the current economics
news. It works well for me and I can easily listen to it 3x faster.

### CafÃ© Brasil
**Category:** Misc â€” **URL:** https://portalcafebrasil.com.br/

When I started listening to this show there were very little politics, but
currently it's a mix of politics, great music, and some good ideas.

I like Luciano's ideas on productivity and even some controversial topics.
Politics is always a two-edged sword for me. Sometimes I agree with him, but not
always.

### Nerdcast
**Category:** Misc â€” **URL:** https://nerdcast.com.b

It was the first podcast I listened to and their quality is amazing. I'm not
listening to all episodes anymore, but they sometimes have great content. I
especially enjoy some yearly especial episodes they do but there are also some
other good ones.


## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English

### Ruby Rogues
**Category:** Tech â€” **URL:** https://devchat.tv/podcasts/ruby-rogues/

It's the best Podcast about the Ruby programming language that I could find.
I'm not working full time with Ruby anymore and I'm not listening to it that
much, but I still recommend it.

### Hardcore History
**Category:** History â€” **URL:** https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/

Is's usually very long episodes about some part of our history. There's a lot of
research to do such an episode, and they do an awesome work. It's like listening
to a history audiobook. I especially recommend the episode about the atomic
bombs.

### How to afford anything
**Category:** Money â€” **URL:** https://affordanything.com/podcast/

The show is reled to money management in general and I like their early
retirement interviews and content. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to
improve their money management.

### Retirement wnswer man
**Category:** Money â€” **URL:** https://www.rogerwhitney.com/blog

This is all about retirement. I was in a path of early retirement some years ago
and I really like the content here. Currently, I'm not totally into FIRE
(Financial Independence Retire Early) anymore, but I still want to find my FI,
so I keep listening to it.

### Philosophize this!
**Category:** Philosophy â€” **URL:** https://www.philosophizethis.org/

The only and best philosophy podcast I found. They have amazing episodes. I
recommend anyone who is curious about philosophy to start from the episode 1 and
keep listening at least until the episode 10. That's what I did and it was a
great experience.


## ðŸŸ¢ Esperanto

### La Pola Retradio
**Category:** News â€” **URL:** http://pola-retradio.org/

It's one of the few Esperanto podcasts I found and it's great to exercise your
listening. They usually talk about general world news and Esperanto related
news.


## ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish

### Programar es una mierda
**Category:** Tech â€” **URL:** https://www.programaresunamierda.com/

I was looking for tech content in Spanish and these guys do it in a way a that
is very familiar to me as a brazilian. It's about technology in general and it
has the same vibe as Dev na estrada sometimes.
