I listen to podcasts since 2007 when I had to download them and transfer to my AAA-batery powered MP3 player every day (ðŸ‘´). A lot changed since then, but I still listen to podcast now and then.
I also used Podcasts to help with my listening to learn new languages, so you will see different languages being listed here. ðŸ˜‰
