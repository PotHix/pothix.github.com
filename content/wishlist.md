Sometimes people want to give me stuff and I would like to refer them to a page.
Well... this is the page for it. ðŸ™‚

This page may contain things from cheap to very expensive, it's OK if I never
receive any of them.

Let's go for the list:

- The DIY version of [the framework laptop](https://frame.work/). i7 with 32GB
  of RAM.
- A DIY kit to build a [Corne keyboard](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/corne-v3). Hot
  swappable chocs.
