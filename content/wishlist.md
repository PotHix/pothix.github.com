Sometimes people want to give me stuff and I would like to refer them to a page.
Well... this is the page for it. ðŸ™‚

This page may contain things from cheap to very expensive, it's OK if I never
receive any of them.

Let's go for the list:

Number one of all is **Time**: This is something I want with all my heart. Time
to not have anything in my calendar and do whatever I want. If you can make it
happen, I will take it.

Now, the list of things to buy:

- [Dust to Dust](https://www.ligamagic.com.br/?view=cards%2Fsearch&card=dust+to+dust&tipo=1): A few copies (4 max) of this card, which will be very useful for me.
- [MNT Pocket Reform](https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform): This thing is amazing and I really want to have it at some point.
- [Lord of the Rings deck of cards by Theory11](https://store.theory11.com/products/lord-of-the-rings-playing-cards): This is just amazing and I would like to have it around. Maybe to be back to Cardistry/Magic training.
- [GameSir G8 Galileo](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2) to play mobile games. Being very honest, I don't really need this one, but it would be nice and I want to keep it here as a bookmark.
