Sometimes people want to give me stuff and I would like to refer them to a page.
Well... this is the page for it. ðŸ™‚

This page may contain things from cheap to very expensive, it's OK if I never
receive any of them.

Let's go for the list:

- [SteamDeck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck)
- [Razer Kishi controller](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2) to play mobile games.
- [MNT Pocket Reform](https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform)
