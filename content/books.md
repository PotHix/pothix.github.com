Here I describe the list of books I recommend to people. The recommendation also
links to my review here, in case you want to have more information about it.

If you want to see all my reviews, not just for the recommended books, I suggest
you to check the [books tag](/tags/books).

Now let's start with my recommendations. ðŸ’ª

## Tolkien: A biography

It's no secret that I'm a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. I have (or had, depending
on when you're reading this) a book collection of 15 printed books and read
almost all of them.

Tolkien was a real nerd and was very dedicated to his studies and languages. His
biography shows a bit more about the man, not just his work. To me, it was like
navigating with him while he wrote the books I love.

The fact that he only had one manuscript of the Lord of the Rings and had to
lend it to his editor is mind-blowind to someone reading it now in 2020. ðŸ¤¯
