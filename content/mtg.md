I'm a big fan of Magic The Gathering (or MTG) since the first time I played it
in 2004, but even before that I saw a friend who had some cards and they were
amazing.

I couldn't play much since then, but I'm back now to play for real. What enabled
me to play MTG was the Pauper format.

I'm currently an owner of the following Pauper decks:

- Temur Affinity
- Mono-White Heroic
- Selesnya (and sometimes Naya ðŸ˜‰) Slivers
- Azban Soul Sisters
