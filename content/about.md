<center><i>\<pt-BR\>Tem também a [versão em português](/about_ptbr)\</pt-BR\></i></center>

I'm Willian Molinari, also known as **PotHix**. I've been working with
software development since 2006, using many languages professionally
throughout the years. I'm a [published author](/writing/) and
usually [speak about programming](/speaking/) around Brazil and the
world.

### Getting in touch

Want to contact me? I decided to centralize the pointers to all my
profiles at [about.me/pothix](https://about.me/pothix).

And obviously, you can always send me an email (I prefer) on pothix
[at] pothix [dot] com or [via Telegram](https://t.me/pothix).

### WTF is PotHix

Well... Here we go again. :)

If you're reading this the probability that you asked me "WTF PotHix
means" is really high, so I redirected you to this page where I tried
to explain the reason of that silly nickname.

Back when [Diablo II](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d2/) was a
hit I had a [Paladin](http://diablo.gamepedia.com/Paladin_(Diablo_II))
char and was playing Diablo a lot with my friends. In the same time I
found that was really boring to create new accounts on some websites
because the name WillianMolinari was already taken on them (yes.. The
same name with the same letters), so I decided that a new nickname was
needed! And started thinking about it.

The requiremens are:

+ Good to read
+ Unique
+ Should represent things I like

With these requirements in mind I started to pick some letters:

+ **P** aladin
+ **o** f
+ **t** he
+ **H** eaven

Nice! It was cool to me, I think nobody else will use PotH as a
Nickname... until I found a guy with PotH as surname when playing
Gunbound (with a 56kbs connection... LOL). So, let's go to the plan B:

+ **ix** - from the *.nix. Linux ftw. :)
So I got PotHix!! Yay!!

Silly, isn't? d-_-b

As you could see on my requirements, I was not thinking on people
calling me by this name, I just wanted a good nickname to use on my
games and logins, but today I'm known as PotHix more than Willian
Molinari. LOL

So, you can stop asking me if PotHix has something to do with
drugs...It is just a nerd thing from someone that haven't considered
people saying this out loud. ;)
