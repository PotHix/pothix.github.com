        <p><strong>Brace yourselves, this post will be HUGE</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It was a <strong>great</strong> year and I&rsquo;m really glad to see the
metrics and notice everything I accomplished.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I posted my yearly review publicly but
as I&rsquo;m doing monthly posts of my stats, it makes sense to do an annual
review as well.</p>
<p>I do yearly reviews since around 2005 but I never post them
publicly. I also write down my goals for the next year, so I can
review them in the last week of the year (like I did some weeks
ago). I write a lot of content but usually don&rsquo;t publish it because I
try to keep this blog less personal. The stats posts are here because
I really think it&rsquo;s great to have metrics about yourself, so you can
evaluate and improve (remember: continuous improvement). These posts
aim to show that in a practical way while helping me to commit to writing
them monthly.</p>
<p>I will try to follow a template like the one I use for
my <a href="/tags/stats">monthly stats</a> but I will also add some other items
and notes about my goals.</p>
<h3 id="-books">✅ Books</h3>
<p>My yearly goal was to read 30 books this year and I read 31.</p>
<p>Last year I read 42 but I decided to not be so aggressive this year
and try a different strategy. The idea was to add a full review
on <a href="https://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> after the book is finished, so I
can think about how much I understood and retained about it.</p>
<p>The experiment went really well and helped me with the process of
adding more notes about the important parts (IMO) of the book. I&rsquo;m
using <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google keep</a> for that, using a label
for book notes. These notes help me to get into the context of the
book. They are also easy to find using Google Keep&rsquo;s search engine
when I need to find a reference.</p>
<p>Here are the books from this year&rsquo;s list that I really recommend
reading, with links to my review:</p>
<p>Non-Fiction</p>

<p>You can always look for my whole
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/38970458-willian-molinari?read_at=2017&amp;sort=date_read">list of books read this year on Goodreads</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some stats provided by Goodreads comparing all the books I
have registered:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/goodreads.png" alt="List of books read by year" title="List of books read by year"></a></p>
<p>I started <a href="/audiobooks/">listening to audiobooks</a> in 2016 and it
was a huge difference in my life, as you can see in the charts above.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the books I read this year with last year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/pothix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/goodreads-details.png" alt="Comparison between 2016 and 2017" title="Comparison between 2016 and 2017"></a></p>
<p>10 books less than last year but it was expected. What bothers me is
that I <strong>only gave 5 stars to 2 books</strong> (comparing to 9 last year)
and <strong>the number of books with 3 starts is higher than the last year</strong>.</p>
<p>The number of books in the &ldquo;audible-deal&rdquo; shelf is higher this year
and most of the books in the 3-stars row are on this shelf&hellip; Maybe
the deal is not worth the price after all.</p>
<p>Even with the high number of books in the 3-star row I&rsquo;m happy with my
results for 2017 regarding books. <a href="http://amzn.to/2AZWD2q">Mastery</a>
was the shiny pearl of this year, I really like it.</p>
<h3 id="-articles">✅ Articles</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have data for the whole year but I can use the
data I have from March to December.</p>
<p>I could not find a good way to track the articles I read. While I&rsquo;m
still looking for a better way to do that, I&rsquo;m
using <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and manually checking it every
month. It means that every article I read since March was added to
Pocket. Sometimes I read from there but others I just add it there to
count as read.</p>
<p>In March I had <strong>760 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>570 articles Read</strong>. Now,
using the data from my <a href="/dec2017">December stats post</a>, I
have <strong>1296 articles Unread</strong> and <strong>946 articles Read</strong>.</p>
<p>It means that <strong>I read 186 articles this year</strong>, an average of <strong>15
articles each month</strong>. I&rsquo;m aware that I will probably never read all
those 1296 articles left in my Pocket account and I&rsquo;m OK with that.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning that my definition of article read is when I found
some interesting and useful article and read that from bottom to end.</p>
<p>I had no goal for reading articles but I decided to track that to
understand how much I read every year. Before starting with audiobooks
I was really frustrated with the state of my reading stats. I was not
reading many books in the year but I had a feeling that I was reading
many articles, which is not so bad. By tracking that I have the data I
need to prove to myself that I&rsquo;m reading enough, which helps with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor symdrome</a>.</p>
<h3 id="-coding">✅ Coding</h3>
<p>All my coding metrics are provided by <a href="https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix">Wakatime</a>.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the total time coding:</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-coding-total.png" alt="Total time coding this year" title="Total time coding this year"></a></p>
<p>I confess that I was expecting much more than that. An average of 1h31
per day looks really low for me.</p>
<p>I felt better when checking the comparison with the user base. It
shows that I have almost twice as many hours coding! :)</p>
<p>The low number of hours is probably related to how Wakatime gets the
stats.</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-projects-total.png" alt="Total time coding by project this year" title="Total time coding by project this year"></a></p>
<p>This year I did a lot for this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the entire layout</li>
<li>migrated it to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a></li>
<li>converted all posts to Hugo
format</li>
<li>redirected old URLs to the new content,</li>
<li>wrote 19 posts (my goal was 10! 😃)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected to have my blog as the first in the
list of projects for this year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to have my freelance project as the second one
because I almost not work for them in the last 6 months! It says that
I was working for them <strong>a lot</strong> in the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud to have <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> on my list of
projects this year. I&rsquo;m using/following Todoist since 2007 and it&rsquo;s
amazing to have the chance to contribute to the app. 🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-editors-total.png" alt="Total time coding by editor this year" title="Total time coding by editor this year"></a></p>
<p>Looks like I fully switched to Emacs. I&rsquo;m not using Vim as I used
before but sometimes I miss some Vim features. I was talking to a
friend last week about it and I mentioned that if I was still using
querty
(<a href="/experiences-of-almost-two-years-using-colemak/">I use Colemak</a>) I
would probably be still using Vim. Emacs is nice and so is Vim. :)</p>
<p>I was using a plugin to register my terminal usage but I think it
generated more noise than signal. 😞</p>
<p><a href="https://wakatime.com/@PotHix" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/wakatime-languages-total.png" alt="Total time coding by language this year" title="Total time coding by language this year"></a></p>
<p>Markdown is the first one for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote many posts on my blog</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m responsible for <a href="https://developer.todoist.com">Todoist</a>
and <a href="https://developer.twistapp.com">Twist</a> documentation</li>
<li>I usually write long post in Emacs and then paste them to Twist</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, we have <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Go</strong>, and a little
bit of <strong>Rust</strong>, <strong>Elixir</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong>. I was playing with
game development in Javascript this year and I really bet in Rust and
Elixir, both languages are really great. I don&rsquo;t think I will have
enough ground to play with Elixir this year but maybe Rust will have
his time in my schedule in 2018. 😃</p>
<p><strong>Go</strong> is on my top 5 list but I&rsquo;m not totally comfortable as I would
like to be, hope to improve it in 2018.</p>
<p>Forget about &ldquo;Other&rdquo; it&rsquo;s related to Bash because of my plugin. 🙄</p>
<p>In general, these are great results IMO. 😃</p>
<h3 id="-speaking">✅ Speaking</h3>
<p>I have to say that I&rsquo;m really proud of myself on this one. 😃</p>
<p>Here is the burndown chart I created to follow up each month (nothing fancy, a simple Google spreadsheets):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/presentations.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/presentations.png" alt="Burn down chart for my presentations" title="Burn down chart for my presentations"></a></p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know yet (because I usually don&rsquo;t post publicly
many things), I was in a &ldquo;competition&rdquo;
with <em><a href="http://milhouseonsoftware.com">Milhouse</a>&rsquo;s last year ghost</em>.</p>
<p>This story is worth sharing since it was part of my goals:</p>
<p><em>In December 2016 I asked Milhouse about how many talks he gave and he</em>
<em>said it was 18 talks. I was stunned. At the time, I was really proud</em>
<em>of my personal record of 12 talks in one year and I know it was really</em>
<em>hard to achieve this number. I asked him to post about it on his blog</em>
<em>and <a href="http://milhouseonsoftware.com/2016/12/29/retro_216/">here it is</a></em>.
<em>When I saw that, I started a competition with</em>
<em>myself, my goal was <strong>to speak in 2017 more than Milhouse did in 2016</strong></em>.</p>
<p>It looks like a time trial race in video games when you have to defeat
your own &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; or the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; of a friend. For those who played bike
racer from <a href="http://www.topfreegames.com/">Top Free Games</a>, it&rsquo;s just
like that.</p>
<p>It may look silly but I always do &ldquo;competitions&rdquo; like that to motivate
myself. Sometimes I use my own data and others I use the data from
someone I admire or someone who did amazing things. This time was
really nice because I told that I was doing it to some friends
(including Milhouse) and it was a cool internal joke between us.</p>
<p>Thanks to that &ldquo;competition&rdquo; I could motivate myself to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Propose a talk to <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> and speak outside the
country in a different language. Milhouse had 1 talk outside of
Brazil, so I had to beat that. For this reason, I spoke in Belgium and Portugal.</li>
<li>Speak 3 times in the same conference
(<a href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br">TDC</a>) about 3 different
languages (Go, Ruby, Javascript) and 3 different fields (CLI, Web,
Games)</li>
<li>Do 5 talks with live-coding. 3 of them starting from scratch, with a
blank text file and 40 minutes of time (For those who don&rsquo;t know,
one of my biggest fears was live-coding talks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Met a lot of new people, studied many languages, and had <strong>a ton</strong> of
fun. I really recommend this motivation hacking. It&rsquo;s not just for
speaking, you can use it for anything you want.</p>
<h3 id="-completed-tasks">✅ Completed tasks</h3>
<p>In the last years, Todoist is providing a Year in review and this year
is no different. If you&rsquo;re a Todoist user, you can check your
data <a href="https://todoist.com/review/2017/you">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check my Todoist tasks! 🙂</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png" alt="Tasks completed on my Todoist account" title="Tasks completed on my Todoist account"></a></p>
<p>Hm, less than I expected but still OK. I was already expecting for
that but looks like <strong>Monday is the day I complete more tasks</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-by-weekday.png" alt="Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account" title="Tasks completed by weekday on my Todoist account"></a></p>
<p><strong>My most productive time is 16:00</strong> and <strong>what I can&rsquo;t finish at this
time I usually postpone at 19:00</strong> 😬:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/tasks-completed-boost-postpone.png" alt="Tasks completed by time and postponed by time" title="Tasks completed by time and postponed by time"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the top 1% of all Todoist users in 2017! 😃</p>
<p>This <em>Year in Review</em> by Todoist is astonishing! I had the chance to
contribute by helping with the pt-BR translation. 🙂</p>
<h3 id="-podcasts">✅ Podcasts</h3>
<p><strong>587 hours</strong> listening to Podcasts. If I was listening to the
episodes in normal time (spoiler: I wasn&rsquo;t) it would be equivalent to
more than 23 days of non-stop listening. My app says that I listened
17 days and 7 hours, but I decided to not trust it because I changed
my Podcast application in the beginning of the year and restored a
backup after it, so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s accurate. Instead of using
the value calculated by the app, I calculated month by month based on
my posts.</p>
<p>I consider that one month of extra time since I listen to Podcasts
while commuting, walking the dog, washing the dishes, doing exercises,
etc. It works <strong>really well</strong> for me and sometimes I change between
Podcasts and audiobooks.</p>
<h3 id="-hours-working-focusing-and-distractions">✅ Hours working, focusing and distractions</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review how was my year related to work. This time I have a lot
of metrics to correlate. \o/</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re following my posts or social networks
(<a href="https://twitter.com/PotHix">Twitter</a> is the only one I&rsquo;m using) you
know that I changed jobs in June. I expect that to have a huge impact
on my metrics.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with time working, considering my full-time job only:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time.png" alt="Chart for time working in my full-time job" title="Chart for time working in my full-time job"></a></p>
<p>It increased a lot from July to
December. At <a href="https://doist.com">Doist</a>, they recommend to not work
more than 8 hours a day and I&rsquo;m clearly not doing that. 😞</p>
<p>Including my freelance job:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time-plus-freelance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-total-time-plus-freelance.png" alt="Chart for time working in my full-time and freelance job" title="Chart for time working in my full-time and freelance job"></a></p>
<p>It looks more even now but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a good thing. I don&rsquo;t
usually work as a freelancer but I work for 1 company for almost two
years now and I really like the challenges they have there, so I would
like to work for them again. To be able to do that, I have to
stabilize my workday.</p>
<p>From July to December I did almost no freelance work for this company:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-freelance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-freelance.png" alt="Chart for time working in my freelance job" title="Chart for time working in my freelance job"></a></p>
<p><strong>A goal for the next year is to work smarter not harder</strong>, so I will have
more time to do other things not related to my full-time job. I really
like my full-time job (more than ever!) but I like to do different
projects without constraints, it can be this freelance job or other
activities that also bring me joy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one metric that makes me feel great. I&rsquo;ve been tracking the
amount of Deep work I do at work since the beginning of the year. I
consider something to be Deep work when I close all external
interruptions (Telegram, Slack, Email, Twist, Cellphone, etc) and
focus on the work I have to do. And for this year I have this:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork.png" alt="Chart for my time Deep working" title="Chart for my time Deep working"></a></p>
<p>What an <strong>AMAZING</strong> thing to see. I really like when I&rsquo;m on the flow
state focusing on my task. That chart shows me that I was happier than
before. 🙂</p>
<p>As I realized that it would not be possible to apply my deep work techniques in my previous job
I was applying that on my freelance work. If I add to the chart all
the freelance work I did for that company (features, bug busting,
infrastructure) we have this:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork-plus-freelance.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-deepwork-plus-freelance.png" alt="Chart for my time Deep working including my freelance" title="Chart for my time Deep working including my freelance"></a></p>
<p>Which is not that bad. 🙂</p>
<p>The good part is that I can apply Deep work to my full-time job
instead of look for a different place to use it. 🎉</p>
<p>I would love to track the time I spent in meetings comparing the first
semester and the second but I was not tracking it in the first
semester. Now, giving that a second thought, even if I tracked, it
would be more noise than signal. Sometimes you have productive
meetings and other times you have &ldquo;meeting that need to be done&rdquo; where
people keep talking about the unrelated stuff in the first 20 minutes
of the meeting to speak about the productive stuff after
that. So&hellip; <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>.</p>
<p>I also have a metric for the <strong>time I spent doing/planning my talks</strong>
this year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-presentation.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/toggl-presentation.png" alt="Chart for my time doing/planning presentations" title="Chart for my time doing/planning presentations"></a></p>
<p>Sometimes I did not track it at all, especially in the beginning of the
year, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning as well. In April and June, I was
practicing for my live-coding session. 🙂</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570">rescuetime</a> to
track my productivity. I&rsquo;m not sure if my configuration is good and I
keep changing them, so these metrics may not be so accurate. A good
example of that is my tracking time, I&rsquo;m also tracking the time at
night when I&rsquo;m talking to friends via Telegram or over the weekend.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the productive and distracting hours for the entire
year:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-productive-hours.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-productive-hours.png" alt="Rescuetime metrics for productive and distracting hours" title="Rescuetime metrics for productive and distracting hours"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/rescuetime-yir-by-category.png" alt="Rescuetime metrics for the category that took most of my time" title="Rescuetime metrics for the category that took most of my time"></a></p>
<p>A lot of distracting hours. As it considers my weekends and nights, I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s accurate. It still bothers me that &ldquo;communication &amp;
scheduling&rdquo; is the most used category. I will change that this year.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t talk about music but <a href="https://last.fm">last.fm</a> did a
good &ldquo;year in review&rdquo; for me, so I will add some stats here.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-scrobbles.png" alt="Songs scrobbled this year" title="Songs scrobbled this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-listening-stats.png" alt="Listening stats for this year" title="Listening stats for this year"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-percentiles.png" alt="Listening percentiles compared to the user base" title="Listening percentiles compared to the user base"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-discovery.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/lastfm-discovery.png" alt="Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year" title="Artists, albums, and track discoveries for this year"></a></p>
<p>I started using the paid version
of <a href="https://music.google.com">Google Music</a> this year, that explains
why my &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; has an increase of &ldquo;558%&rdquo; this year. I also almost
doubled the number of artists I listened this year.</p>
<p>Some interesting statistics are related to the time I listened to more
songs. It seems that I listen to more songs between 20:00 and
21:00. It&rsquo;s usually when I want to do something different and need
more energy. Wednesday is the day I listen to more music, I have no
idea why it&rsquo;s so different than the rest. 🤔</p>
<p>And the obvious part&hellip; I listen to metal most of the time. 😜</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h3>
<p>I will use my <a href="https://www.tvshowtime.com">tvshowtime</a> stats to get
some data about it. Here are my data for January and December:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched in January" title="TV shows watched in January"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/tvshows.jpg" alt="TV shows watched in December" title="TV shows watched in December"></a></p>
<p>Based on that (and ignoring how much I watched in January) I can get
to the conclusion that <strong>I watched 241 episodes</strong>, more than 4
episodes a week.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that tvshowtime uses 30 days for one month. In this
case, <strong>I spent 8 days and 5 hours of my year watching TV shows</strong>.</p>
<p>As I don&rsquo;t usually watch TV, I will consider that 1 week and half of
my entire year was spend watching TV. It&rsquo;s 2% of all my time spent
with TV, not sure if it&rsquo;s good enough.</p>
<h3 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h3>
<p>I was expecting to have an easy work on this one since I have some
apps for metrics but turns out that it&rsquo;s not so easy to retrieve
yearly information. 😞</p>
<p>What I did to get the information I need was to look month by month
and take screenshots on my cell phone. I&rsquo;m not including November and
December because December is truncated in the monthly view for some
reason and it would be too much work to include November alone. It was
not so easy or pleasant to get that but here is the data regarding my
steps:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jan.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jan.jpg" alt="Number of steps from January to May" title="Number of steps from January to May"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jun.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/steps-jun.jpg" alt="Number of steps from June to October" title="Number of steps from June to October"></a></p>
<p>Nothing so unusual. It was mostly stable and I had peaks in February
and October, the two months I was traveling to Europe.</p>
<p>Regarding my sleep:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jan.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jan.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep from January to May" title="Amount of sleep from January to May"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jun.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/sleep-jun.jpg" alt="Amount of sleep from June to October" title="Amount of sleep from January to October"></a></p>
<p>Looks like my deep sleeping (the dark purple) increased in the second
semester. It&rsquo;s interesting because it correlates with the dates I
started in my new job at Doist. In February, when I was not working, I
had a good rate of deep sleeping as well, I will assume it was stress
related to my previous job.</p>
<p>In general, it looks good to me.</p>
<h3 id="-words-written-and-errors">✅ Words written and errors</h3>
<p>After consolidating all the data I collected from Grammarly this year
I have the following:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/grammarly.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/grammarly.png" alt="Grammarly data for this year" title="Grammarly data for this year"></a></p>
<p>I just copied and pasted all the data from all posts into a Google
Spreadsheets and generated a chart, no science here. January,
February and March have no data, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The interesting metric I can get from this chart is that I&rsquo;m writing a
lot more and the <em>corrections made</em> are not increasing at the same
pace. This is really great to see. 😃</p>
<p>Unique words are stable since I started tracking my words. Looks like
my vocabulary is not increasing but I think it&rsquo;s normal, we usually
don&rsquo;t use difficult words in our day-to-day life.</p>
<h3 id="-locations">✅ Locations</h3>
<p>This year was amazing regarding traveling. I went to Belgium,
Netherlands, Scotland, England, Portugal, Spain, and visited many
different cities. I&rsquo;m planning some posts about those cities for a
while now, maybe someday.</p>
<p>In one of those trips I had a goal to speak with people from other
countries and had long conversations with people from Germany, Poland,
Spain, Scotland, Colombia, Canada, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Japan,
Brazil, Uruguay, Australia, Russia, Ireland, Portugal, India, Belgium,
Bosnia, France, Argentina, and Netherlands. It was really great. 😀</p>
<p>Now that you know about the trips, I don&rsquo;t know if I can trust the
data provided by Google Locations. Take your own conclusions:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have my data for January, the first record was
in February (after visiting more than 13 cities in 4 countries):</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/feb/location-general.png" alt="General data for February" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>And this is the data for December:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/location-general.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/dec/location-general.png" alt="General data for December" title="General view of my locations data"></a></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look so different even with all those travels. Considering
that I visited Porto, Lisbon, and Barcelona in October, it doesn&rsquo;t
make any sense. 😞</p>
<p>I use Google maps and Google trips to find new places to go. I&rsquo;m
a <a href="https://maps.google.com/localguides">Google maps local guide</a> and I
usually add reviews to the map. As a side-effect of that, I have stars
in almost all places I go.</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-europe.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-europe.png" alt="My Google maps in Europe" title="My Google maps in South America"></a>
<a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-south-america.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-south-america.png" alt="My Google maps in South America" title="My Google maps in South America"></a></p>
<p>I hope to have many other stars soon. :)</p>
<p>According to
<a href="https://matadornetwork.com/travel-map/22396bbf7ad1af6c0d8758cb54077e13-1515270907">matadornetwork</a>,
I visited 8 countries so far:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-world.png" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/maps-world.png" alt="My world map" title="My world map"></a></p>
<h3 id="-expenses">✅ Expenses</h3>
<p>I would love to do a deep analysis on this topic but unfortunately,
the apps I use do not provide an easy way of doing this. The only
thing I got was this chart for the last 6 months:</p>
<p><a href="/images/stats/2017/yir/expenses.jpg" title=""><img src="/images/stats/2017/yir/expenses.png" alt="Expenses by category in the last 6 months" title="Expenses by category in the last 6 months"></a></p>
<p>The legend in the left is not so good because I had to remove the
actual values in cash to keep the percentages only. 🙄</p>
<p>Looking into this chart I can see that &ldquo;Viagem&rdquo; (travel) took almost
35% of my expenses. I tend to live a frugal life, so it makes sense to
have my travel expenses taking most part of my money spent. For me,
traveling is an investment and I don&rsquo;t regret spending money on it.</p>
<p>It bothers me that &ldquo;Compras&rdquo; (general spending) is the second category
of my expenses. I was expecting to have &ldquo;Mercado&rdquo; (groceries) here or
maybe &ldquo;Bares / Restaurantes&rdquo; (eating out), but not &ldquo;compras&rdquo;. I will
look closely at it this year because it&rsquo;s an yellow flag for my
expenses.</p>
<p>Regarding my savings, it <strong>increased by 16.83%</strong> this year,
considering the value I had at the end of April (I don&rsquo;t have data for
Jan, Feb, and March). It&rsquo;s an <strong>average of 2.10%</strong> for each month, so
if we apply that for January, February, March, and April, <strong>we would
have 25.25%</strong>. In the end of the year, I had 75.10% of my savings goal.</p>
<p>Considering that I did not receive any payment in the last 6 months,
it&rsquo;s <strong>really great</strong>! I&rsquo;m already expecting for a huge increase in my
savings for January when I received the payment for the work in the
last months. 😃</p>
<h3 id="time-to-write-this-blog-post">Time to write this blog post</h3>
<p>Well, this one took some time. 😜</p>
<p>I started it on the airplane, coming back from York. Unfortunately, I
lost my tracking because of a software problem but I doubt I spent
less than 2 hours on it, so let&rsquo;s consider 2 hours.</p>
<p>After that I worked for 07h15min more, so we have <strong>9h15min to write
this blog post</strong> and it worth it, for sure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>What a great year! :)</p>
<p>It is the first time I have that so much metrics to play with. I could
get some interesting information about how was my year and how some
changes influenced my behavior for good or bad.</p>
<p>It took a lot more time than I was expecting but I hope to have an
automated way to do that in the next year.</p>
<p>I achieved almost all of my goals last year, so I don&rsquo;t have anything
to complain. Hope that this year become even better than the last one.</p>
