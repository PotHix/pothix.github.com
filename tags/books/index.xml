      <description>Book: The Little Sisters of Eluria (The Dark Tower, #0.5) by Stephen King. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fun story for those who are into the Dark Tower series. It&amp;rsquo;s a short story actually, and brings a bit more about Roland&amp;rsquo;s early adventures, happening a bit before &amp;ldquo;The Gunslinger&amp;rdquo;.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t add much to the whole story other than just showing a bit more of a random place in the Mid-World, but it&amp;rsquo;s still an enjoyable story.</description>

      <description>Book: The Wind Through the Keyhole by Stephen King. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I wish I have read this book in chronological order. The book is not bad, but reading it right after finishing the series just because it was released afterwards was not a good call. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if I would have enough motivation to continue reading the series if I read this book right after book 4.</description>

      <description>Book: The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7) by Stephen King. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
√öltimo livro da s√©rie, tamb√©m lido (ouvido!) em Portugu√™s, ent√£o vamos ao review em pt-BR.
Eu estava bem curioso com o fim da hist√≥ria e como as coisas se resolveriam com a torre, o ka-tet, Mordred, o Rei Rubro, etc. Tamb√©m estava preparado para muita coisa, dado que √© um livro do Stephen King.
A forma que o King construiu os personagens foi fant√°stica e me deixou bem apegado a eles.</description>

      <description>Book: The Lottery by Shirley Jackson. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I decided to read The Lottery after reading The Waste Lands (The Dark Tower, #3. They mention the book because of a situation happening in Lud, and they call it &amp;ldquo;Shirley&amp;rsquo;s nightmare&amp;rdquo;. I took some notes about it and added this short story to my reading list.
It&amp;rsquo;s funny how random the situation is in Lud when the plot is revealed, but their case was much more complicated üòÖ.</description>

      <description>Book: The Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allan Poe. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I decided to read this book after reading Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, #6). This book was mentioned because the &amp;ldquo;Red Death&amp;rdquo; was described there too, so I was curious to read the original story.
It&amp;rsquo;s all about a prince defying the disease by locking his people inside their castle walls with enough supplies and goodies. They do &amp;ldquo;masked parties inside.</description>

      <description>Book: Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, #6) by Stephen King. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Livro lido (ouvido? üôÇ) em Portugu√™s, portanto review em Portugu√™s tamb√©m.
Gostei bastante do livro, foi curto e direto ao ponto. Parece que o Stephen King escreveu os 3 √∫ltimos livros de uma vez, um pr√≥ximo do outro para terminar a hist√≥ria e eles encaixaram de uma vez muita coisa que estava faltando.
Nesse livro aconteceu algo que eu n√£o vi em nenhum outro livro que eu li at√© hoje.</description>

Estou lendo essa s√©rie em portugu√™s, ent√£o os reviews tamb√©m ser√£o em portugu√™s. Eu gostei mais desse livro do que do anterior porque ele moveu mais a hist√≥ria para a frente ao inv√©s de dar mais contexto para as coisas. Conhecer uma nova cidade e os ocultismos que vem com ela foi bem interessante. Eu tamb√©m curti saber mais sobre &amp;ldquo;Os outros mundos al√©m desse&amp;rdquo; e como as coisas se conectam.</description>

Outro livro que li em Portugu√™s, ent√£o o review vai ser em Portugu√™s tamb√©m.
Eu gostei do livro no geral. Parece que a sensa√ß√£o de &amp;ldquo;nossa, que legal&amp;rdquo; e &amp;ldquo;mano, que bizarro&amp;rdquo; est√° se atenuando cada vez mais. Em alguns momentos eu fico bem interessado sobre como as hist√≥rias do mundo de Roland de Gilead (n√£o consigo chamar de Roland Deschain.</description>

Ouvi esse livro em Portugu√™s (e provavelmente farei o mesmo para todos os pr√≥ximos). Eu tenho todos os livros f√≠sicos mas preferi procurar um audiobook para facilitar a minha &amp;ldquo;leitura&amp;rdquo;.
Assim como o livro 2, esse me surpreendeu bastante (talvez porque eu gostei pouco do primeiro). Agora eu estou come√ßando a me envolver com a hist√≥ria e ficar curioso com o mundo da Torre Negra.</description>

What a surprise! I enjoyed listening to this book. I have the whole series of books (printed version) here and decided to listen to the first one some years ago. I was not very impressed by it and decided to put the who series aside for some time. Last month I decided to give the second book a shot.</description>

      <description>Book: The Life‚ÄëChanging Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I like the book and there are very few things I disagree with the author. I think it&amp;rsquo;s too much to talk to objects, but I understand where this is coming from. In my opinion, just holding the object is enough, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t talk to them.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to remove all objects from your bad/purse every day.</description>

      <description>Book: Tolkien‚Äôs Ordinary Virtues, by Mark Eddy Smith. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I‚Äôm a big fan of Tolkien (if you follow me or my blog, you probably already know that) and decided to give a chance to this one even knowing it was totally related to religion and it‚Äôs not my thing anymore.
The book is about Christian comparisons between The Lord of the Rings and some virtues shown in the Bible. I know talking took his Catholic religion very seriously and was even raised by a Priest after his mother passed away, so it would be nice to see the book again through these lenses.</description>

      <description>Book: Daily Rituals: How Artists Work. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I just read the book When and it mentioned this book. The idea was so interesting that I decided to give it a try.
What first caught my attention was the pattern of the peak, through, rebound everywhere. It&amp;rsquo;s not everywhere because we&amp;rsquo;re just mentioning artists here. I believe a similar pattern tends to emerge whenever people have control over their time.</description>

      <description>Book: When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, by Daniel Pink. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I read this book two times. The first time I had no context and was just looking for something to improve myself. The second time I read it to review everything I used and implemented so I could quote the book when writing an article about how to manage your energy to be more effective.
The book provides amazing insights if you like to base your decisions on scientific research.</description>

      <description>Book: J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, by Humphrey Carpenter. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret to anyone that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. I have 3 versions of this book. A translated version (pt-BR), the original version in English, and the audiobook. It&amp;rsquo;s no news that it would be a 5 star book to me.
I just listened to the Inklings book by Humphrey Carpenter, so it was the best time to also listen to this one (yes, I went for the Audiobook).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m giving it 5 stars because I enjoyed it a lot and it came at the right time for me. For most people, it will probably be a 4-stars book.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien and also the concept of the Inklings. I have my own spin-off of this group with some friends but instead of discussing literature, we just take some time to have some deep conversation about anything.</description>

      <description>Book: Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
This is a great book for sure. I started reading it in 2017 but never find the time to read it. Now, thanks to having two babies at home, I have enough time to read while waiting for them to sleep. :)
There are many things I like about this book. The first is the comparisons with C and C++ since both authors are/were C/C++ developers.</description>

      <description>Book: Nonviolent Communication by Marshall B. Rosenberg. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Great book! It&amp;rsquo;s short and straight to the point.
In summary, we should emphasize more with other people and understand what they are really trying to say. Sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t communicate well and it&amp;rsquo;s up to someone to find out what is the problem and raise the right questions.
This book feels even more important now that we have more people working remotely.</description>

It was a suggestion from a friend when I published the review of Don&amp;rsquo;t Panic: Taking Control of Anxiety Attacks, as he found the content to be complimentary.
I liked the book overall. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how the author shows some scientific facts of the &amp;ldquo;positive thinking&amp;rdquo; which contradicts the current collective thinking. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything against positive thinking, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure positive thinking alone will not do much.</description>

A good book and exactly what I needed, thanks for the recommendation, Rafael Rosa!
Some people said it seems like a Rust programming language book because of the word &amp;ldquo;panic&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s actually related to panic/anxiety attacks. It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time I suffer from anxiety but it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I felt the panic attack symptoms, so I decided to read more about it.</description>

Nothing outstanding, but a good book overall.
I like listening to books like this one from time to time as it helps me to again think about what is essential. This topic is something we tend to forget and having a reminder is nice.
Sometimes we have so much noise around that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find what is really essential to us.</description>

I love these kinds of dialogues where both sides know how to win something. Currently, there are not many good dialogues on our society, especially with the advent of social media (üôÑ), but I would not go into detail here.

A short and good book. After reading Letters from a Stoic, I got the recommendation of this book as well and it was worth listening to it. This book makes me think about the way I&amp;rsquo;m living my life and how I&amp;rsquo;m using my time (not focusing enough?).
If you want a quick and meaningful book, pick this one. :)</description>

      <description>Book: Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World book and this is another great book by Cal Newport. This one is not life-changing as Deep work was for me, but it brings great insights into technology in general.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of social networks in general, they are mostly a waste of time in my point of view.</description>

A great book. I felt like it&amp;rsquo;s a compilation of some good books I read in the past years. It was not a life-changing book for me but it was great to review the important info I collected in the past years. I would totally recommend this book as the first book for someone looking for performance improvement.</description>

I got a recommendation for this book on Quora. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember what was the question about, but I usually mark some books to read when I get these &amp;ldquo;books you should read&amp;rdquo; questions.
I had low expectations about this one and it surprised me. :)
It was great to follow Steve&amp;rsquo;s career from a broke comedian to a famous one.</description>

      <description>Book: How to Be Free: An Ancient Guide to the Stoic Life by Epictetus. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
A good book. It seems like a summary of the whole enchiridion. After reading Seneca, I decided to try Epictetus. These books are usually very dense and require some time to think about, so I decided to not go with the long form of the enchiridion. I do not regret it; it was a good reading/listening.</description>

      <description>Book: Letters from a Stoic by Seneca. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I was expecting a bit more about this book but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is just a problem with my expectations. The book is a collection of letters from Seneca to Lucilius, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what you should expect from it. Seneca was a wise man and these letters contain great pieces of advice. Many of these advices are still valid today, but some makes much more sense when you consider the whole context in which Seneca was at the time.</description>

This is the kind of book you read and think: &amp;ldquo;I would love to have read this when I was starting my career&amp;rdquo;, as you have seen a lot of what he describes during the past 10 years.
I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I did most of what he mentions here, and I can say it works.</description>

Esse livro conta a hist√≥ria dele querendo ser um cientista em Corn√©lio Proc√≥pio. Parece ser uma boa descri√ß√£o do que √© ser um cientista no Brasil no geral pelo que ou√ßo falar de outros cientistas tamb√©m.</description>

Amazing book! It has the potential to be life-changing for me.
When I started reading it, my review was around 3 stars. This book is not easy to read and sometimes (especially in the beginning) it feels boring. It took me some time to engage in the topic. I think I felt the same when reading Deep Work.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a good book but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not for me.
They mostly talk about their personal experiences and how they helped them to get better. There are some interesting experiences, especially because they were working for Google in the past and the culture of meetings is really strong there.
I already knew many things exposed here, so it was not life-changing for me.</description>

This book was in my reading list for a while. After an exam that requires pupil dilatation, I decided to go for the audiobook as it would not require any notes. :)
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the influence of Norse Mythology in some things. I particularly noted that Ragnarok mentions the coldest winter, which is also mentioned in ASOIAF as something the is near to the end of the world.</description>

The interesting part of reading this book is that I&amp;rsquo;m currently living most part of it in the past 2 years. :)
The book itself is a little bit outdated as it was written in 2013 and we had a very different scenario then. They mention it in the first chapter, BTW.
I found it to be a little repetitive as well, they are not very pragmatic about the content and decided to mention things over and over again so you can open the book in any particular chapter and use it as a reference (at least that&amp;rsquo;s what I felt).</description>

This is a great book that made me pause many times think. This is the kind of book I love to read. I heard some criticism about Yuval&amp;rsquo;s books and they are mostly related to his way to connect things that he is not an expert about. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s the best part of the books because it also makes me consider the connections and think about them.</description>

This one is hard to rate. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I liked it or not, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the structure of the book.
It starts as a non-fiction/business book, as I expected it to be, but out of nowhere, it became &amp;ldquo;a novel&amp;rdquo; (big quotes here). This &amp;ldquo;novel&amp;rdquo; part was not too bad, I liked it in the end, but it was totally unexpected.</description>

One of the best books I ever read. The amount of information here is huge. There are many things I did not know about the history and some possible explanations about where we came to the current state.
I really like the way the author says &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t know this yet&amp;rdquo;. Sometimes, we just don&amp;rsquo;t have the answer but we have many proposed theories, so he talks about them and lets you reach your own conclusions.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a good book, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to complain about it. Some &amp;ldquo;laws&amp;rdquo; seem to be fillers to me, but many make total sense.

I follow their blog for a while now and like it a lot, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the same feeling with the book.
It was interesting to read that they felt themselves to be privileged when comparing to the rest of the population. Financial independence is not for everyone but frugality can be and that&amp;rsquo;s what they tried to say, IMO.</description>

I was between a 4 and 5 stars for this book and decided to go with 4.
The ideas behind this book are amazing, especially when you read a little bit about Orwell and the political scenario of the time. It is a criticism of many things but it&amp;rsquo;s still an interesting construct of what may happen in a very extreme scenario.
The whole idea of creating a language to limit how people describe things and how they think is a really interesting concept.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s an OK book if you&amp;rsquo;re a Tolkien fan.
For those who like Tolkien and everything he researched, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting book to read. I would not recommend this book to someone who&amp;rsquo;s not into Tolkien.
There are three poems in this book and it tries to tell a story about how Tolkien wrote the final poem. None of them are that great alone but together they show one particular part of Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s style of writing/researching.</description>

A great book if you are a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien (like me).
I read 10+ J.R.R. Tolkien books already. I really like the descriptive way of writing and the whole fantasy world he created. I also read some other books that are not related to middle earth.
With that said, it was amazing to me to find so much that was not explicit in the story.</description>

Nice book but not that simple for those who are not engaged with physics. That&amp;rsquo;s not a problem with the book, IMO, physics is complicated.
The pacing of the book is really good. He starts with the basics of physics and how paper after paper it is changing. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how Stephen Hawking puts himself as part of that story, not the center of it.</description>

      <description>Book: The Introvert&amp;rsquo;s Edge: How the Quiet and Shy Can Outsell Anyone by Matthew Owen Pollard. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I bought this book because I wanted to understand a little bit more about introverts, so I can improve myself and understand others better. In the end, this book is totally related to sales, and part of it was not so interesting to me.
I have to say that his method seems to be really good.</description>

      <description>Book: Managing Oneself by Peter F. Drucker. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
This book is not life-changing but it&amp;rsquo;s small, straight to the point, and has many terrific bits of advice for your career and life.
I would totally recommend you to read it since it&amp;rsquo;s not expensive and quick to read/listen to (around 1 hour on Audible).
Here are my raw notes about the book:

Um livro bem interessante para aqueles que querem pensar sobre algumas coisas mais &amp;ldquo;profundas&amp;rdquo; mas sem precisar adentar em um idioma mais complicado. Os autores comentam de forma simples sobre algumas quest√µes interessantes (e as vezes complicadas) da filosofia. Se voc√™ j√° conhece muitas delas mais a fundo, provavelmente esse n√£o seja um livro para voc√™.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a good book overall, especially if you are (or want to be) a CEO. Some (many?) ideas are not aligned with the way I would manage my own company, but there are many useful insights into hairy situations one may be faced during his CEO time.
Sometimes the author contradicts himself, IMO.</description>

Good book overall, I did not take notes because it seems like a fictional book. :P
If you like this book I would also recommend you to read Masters of Doom and some chapters of Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution where they tell some game companies stories.
I would also add Indie game: the movie (also available on Netflix) to the list of complimentary content.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a good book. There are some good insights, some things that only work for a particular context, and some others that I disagree.
I have to highlight one item of my notes:

I bought this book as an Audible daily deal. For the price and size of the book, it was ok.
The book is exactly what the author says in the beginning: It&amp;rsquo;s a lecture that became a book. It can be summarized in less than 10 lines. Please read the other reviews and you will know the whole book.</description>

Great book if you&amp;rsquo;re curious about stoicism and its practices. After reading this I found that I&amp;rsquo;m practicing many techniques of stoicism for many years without knowing it.
The book starts with the history of stoicism, the first stoics, and the context of their time. The beginning is not pragmatic as I was expecting but when I finished the book, I decided it was a good thing.</description>

Nice book. I first heard of Josh when listening to Tim Ferriss show and then I got a recommendation (tks, Amir!).
The author is the guy from &amp;ldquo;Searching for Bobby Fischer&amp;rdquo; movie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108065/). He was a chess prodigy as a kid and a Tai Chi Chuan champion as an adult. The links between the learning of martial arts and chess are really interesting.</description>

I just read &amp;ldquo;rich dad poor dad&amp;rdquo; before reading this one and I think it ruined my experience. After reading that book first, this one looks like a puzzle you already know the answer.
This book is a series of parables of the &amp;ldquo;richest man in Babylon&amp;rdquo; (as you expect) and you need to read the parables understand the context and translate it to your life if you want to get something useful from it.</description>

The first part of this book was truly amazing. I really enjoyed the way he was showing the difference that both dads tell him how to live life and invest in his future. It was really great to take children for that because some things just don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for a child and are really easy to explain to the reader without having to rely on his current knowledge.</description>

Amazing book! It&amp;rsquo;s worth 5 stars.
I listened to it on Audible, and it&amp;rsquo;s around 1h30 of audio, straight to the point. He is not theorizing about what should be right or what you should do to be successful. Instead, he is talking about his experience and what he thinks were the goods and bad choices he made.
This book was concise enough and with tons of valuable information to earn this 5 stars review.</description>

I received this book from a monk while walking on the streets of York (UK) last year. I gave a small donation, and he told me to keep the book, so I decided to read it. He said it was about meditation, but it&amp;rsquo;s about yoga in general (not the physical practice).
I was not aware of anything related to Bhagavad Gita, Krishna, or anything like that, so it was an enjoyable reading for me.</description>

The first H.P. Lovecraft book I read/listen and now I understand what people say from his descriptions.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how he keeps the suspense until the last 5% of the book. The bad part is that it becomes boring sometimes. You want to understand was is there and why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it but he keeps describing icy mountains and large rooms.</description>

I listen to their Podcast and read some articles on their website. This book looks like a list of pointers to their website.

      <description>Book: On Power by Robert A. Caro. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Not that much to learn from this &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s really small (almost two hours of audio) and looks like an abridged version of a collection of other books. I&amp;rsquo;m not American, so I&amp;rsquo;m not part of the context or his target audience and maybe it also plays some role here.
The whole thing about the electricity was a reality for my mom (and for me when I visited my grandparents as a child) in Brazil, it may be shocking to people living in New York nowadays but I already knew all of that in my own context.</description>

I tend to not read much science fiction but this is a great book.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien because I love the way he used to build his world. I found Rama an amazing place where things work in a different way but following most of the same laws we have.

A good book to introduce physics to common people.
Neil deGrasse Tyson is great at explaining complicated topics in a simple way. The explanation of dense objects using hot chocolate and cream was really nice for me (no spoilers, read it! :D).

It has many truths, you will notice many of them if you&amp;rsquo;re working for a big company. You may not agree with some parts of it depending on how you see work and people but if you really care about people careers and the performance of your team it makes a lot of sense.</description>

      <description>Book: Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman by Yvon Chouinard. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It was 3 stars until 70% of the book but the ending deserves 4.
This book is the story of Patagonia and how its founders deal with business, people, and the environment.
Their way of life resonates a lot with what I think is a good way to live. Maintain a sustainable business, hire people you trust and give them enough freedom to live a good life while giving their best to make the company grow, thinking about the environment, grow only when you have to grow (to supply your demand), live a minimalistic life, and so many other stuff.</description>

      <description>Book: The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership by Bill Walsh. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great book on leadership. I confess that I was really bored in the first 15% of the book. The beginning is boring for those who don&amp;rsquo;t give a f*ck about football but keep reading, it worth the journey. Bill Walsh took the San Francisco 49ers from a really bad performance (2 wins/14 losses) to an amazing one (13 win/3 losses) 2 years later.</description>

A good book, but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not for me.
I really like books that have a lot of research behind it, this is one of them. For almost every assumption made, the author reveals research done to support his point.
This book made me realize that our words do not give meaning to something.</description>

Here are some few sentences I like and some comments on them:

 That&amp;rsquo;s really sad. Elon has a great vision of the future and you can feel like him when reading the book (at least I can).</description>

An ordinary book. 3 stars are good enough.
The whole book discusses how to do business when you have no money. Daymond is the man behind Fubu and a TV show called Shark Tank. His story is really interesting to follow because he raised his entire business out of nothing, following the power of broke principle.</description>

      <description>Book: Einstein no Brasil by Aguinaldo Prandini Ricieri. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Um livro comum, com apenas um quote que valeu muito a pena. No geral consegui extrair algumas poucas boas informa√ß√µes sobre o Einstein daqui.
Muita coisa do que tem nesse livro √© parte do contexto do Brasil em 1925. Apesar da visita do Einstein ter sido noticiada em v√°rios jornais e ele ter recebido homenagens de v√°rios grupos, n√£o teve nada muito revelador.</description>

Great book, 4.5 stars.
Mike does a great job describing how is the life of an astronaut. Listen (yes, I used an Audible audiobook) to his story was like living it with him. I could feel how was to be waiting for the NASA phone call after so many years trying to be an astronaut.</description>

It is a good book. I almost gave 3 stars, but it is still a Mastery effect. It deserves four.
Each chapter in the book is devoted to a specific area: Motivation, Teams, Focus, Goal setting, Managing others, Decision making, Innovation, and Absorbing data.
My notes on each topic:

This is one of those books for Tolkien fans. I do not recommend it if you did not read other books by Tolkien.
It is nice to read if you already read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This book shows a lot of details that Tolkien used as a guideline to write the book.</description>

The whole book is about meditation and I would say 50% of it is about focusing on your breathe.
The chapter about loving kindness is also interesting. There are some quotes of Buddha that are really great.

Um livro para quem √© f√£ de Tolkien.

A hist√≥ria de Kullervo inspirou muito do que aconteceu na hist√≥ria de Turin Turambar, al√©m de outras coisas que s√£o contadas no Silmarilion.</description>

I decided to read this book one month before visiting the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam. My plan is to use the whole context of the book to have the full experience when visiting the museum.
The book is OK. Most part of it is just what you expect from a diary of a 14 years old girl, even with the whole context implied.</description>

The key point of this book is: what makes successful people is a match of many factors. Some of those factors were not clear to me.</description>

      <description>Book: The Memory Illusion: Remembering, Forgetting, and the Science of False Memory by Julia Shaw. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
The whole point of this book is to show that our memories are not reliable. We can&amp;rsquo;t be sure that something happened because a lot of things may influence our past memories.
The good argument in favor of this book is its references. There are many references for academic studies. The bad part is that it is not so comfortable to read, the language is not that good.</description>

I tend to not implement algorithms just for the sake of learning a new one and this is not a good thing. When you read these kinds of books you understand why it&amp;rsquo;s so important to know which kinds of algorithms already exists and which problems they solve.</description>

      <description>Book: Programming Phoenix: Productive |&amp;gt; Reliable |&amp;gt; Fast by Chris McCord. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It is a great book for web developers learning Elixir (yeah, not just Phoenix).
I&amp;rsquo;m on the path of playing with Elixir and was looking for a book to amplify my knowledge. I first started with Programming Elixir, from Dave Thomas but I was looking for something more practical.
I decided to try Programming Phoenix and found that it shows everything I need to know about Elixir to build a web application.</description>

This is a great book for IT folks.
In case you worked (or still work) in a big company with lots of ITIL things that holds the development, this book will be like home for you.
It is a typical hero&amp;rsquo;s journey and the characters are not so well developed (IMO) but the story is still good to follow.</description>

I already use many of the tips mentioned in this book and they really work. It makes a good pair with habitica.com, in case you like to play these kinds of games in real life.
There are many great references for the nerds out there.</description>

Here are my raw notes about the book:

I&amp;rsquo;ve used the Audible Abridged version for this one. The narration is not good as the other audiobooks I&amp;rsquo;m used to listen.
The book content is not good to follow as well. It is focused on interrogation and this is not my goal for reading it.
But it is not all that bad. I got some interesting tips on body language and these kind of stuff.</description>

The concept of system 1 (fast) and system 2 (slow) is really great.
For tech folks, the system 1 looks like a cache inside your head. It is the best way to explain it for tech related people, in my opinion.
There are dozens of serious research done to make this book happen. They were not made exclusively for the book, but it is really nice to read a book that has strong foundations.</description>

Esse livro mostra todos os conceitos gatilhos, janelas, autofluxo e etc. dentro de um romance. A hist√≥ria √© ok e chega a ser interessante at√© perto do final. Na minha vis√£o ficou n√≠tido que a hist√≥ria n√£o √© o centro do livro e sim os conceitos que est√£o envolvidos com ela.</description>

Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to &amp;ldquo;properly read/listen&amp;rdquo; now.
I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results.</description>

Quem me conhece sabe que h√° muito tempo eu ou√ßo podcasts sempre que eu posso, principalmente no caminho entre a minha casa e o trabalho. No fim do ano de 2015 eu vi a quantidade de livros que o Rafael Rosa leu e fiquei abismado. Ele leu mais de 90 livros em um ano! Tudo bem que ele estava em um per√≠odo sab√°tico, mas mesmo assim ainda √© uma quantidade bem absurda de livros para se ler em um ano.</description>

This book is amazing! There are some non-sense parts but in general, it makes you think about &amp;ldquo;life, universe, and everything&amp;rdquo;.
There are some ideas that look so absurd in real life but make sense in the book context. If you&amp;rsquo;re that kind of geek/nerd that likes physics (you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert, just an enthusiast) this book will be great.</description>

There are some great insights, at least for me, in this book. The author says that the world works on the &amp;ldquo;outside-in&amp;rdquo; but we need to work on the &amp;ldquo;inside out&amp;rdquo;, taking care of ourselves and doing the best to make things better.</description>

√â um livro muito legal para quem √© f√£ de Tolkien. A hist√≥ria √© bem pequena, menos da metade de livro. O restante do livro √© um pouco de contexto sobre a hist√≥ria e porque ela foi escrita, juntamente com algumas liga√ß√µes sobre a vida do Tolkien na √©poca.
Esse foi o √∫ltimo livro escrito pelo Tolkien antes de sua morte e diz muito sobre o seus pensamentos sobre escrita, sobre o mundo das &amp;ldquo;fadas&amp;rdquo; (que n√£o tem nada a ver com o que pensamos dele atualmente) e sobre a vida no geral.</description>

There are almost 10 years from this book release and the ideas are still valid for the software development industry that we have now.
Some of them can&amp;rsquo;t be applied to big and established companies, but it shows why small companies can beat them if they know how to organize. &amp;ldquo;Divide and conquer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Do only what is needed&amp;rdquo; are the core of this book IMO.</description>

I have mixed feelings about this one. I got some cool insights about financing and how I can improve my plant of financial freedom, but the book was repetitive most of the time.
When I started this book my feeling was: &amp;ldquo;Man, this may be one of the best books I read&amp;rdquo;. Some time ago I was reading a lot of &amp;ldquo;soon you&amp;rsquo;ll see&amp;rdquo; or even repeating what was said before.</description>

O come√ßo do livro √© bem confuso e muitas vezes eu tinha que reler para entender em qual contexto as coisas estavam acontecendo.

Essential reading for those who wants to write a book. I really like the way that Christopher explores movies like Titanic, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King. The examples of the Hero&amp;rsquo;s journey based on this movie really helped me to understand the various archetypes and how they interact in each stage of the journey.

A good book! I always wanted to read Sherlock Holmes books but never tried it. Thanks to BBC&amp;rsquo;s Sherlock Series I decided to give it a try. The good part is that I could understand a lot of jokes that the TV show made and the differences from the 189x to 201x. :)
I really recommend you to read it if you like stories on investigation.</description>

TL; DR - A lot of theories about the next economic crash, if you want to know some connections between gold, dollar and other different investments to protect you in case it happens, it may be a good book for you.
I&amp;rsquo;m Brazilian and some part of the economic context is not the same here, but there are some parts make totally sense.</description>

      <description>Book: Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven D. Levitt. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Nice book with really interesting statistics done in some sets of data. It remembers me about the whole &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; trend that we have today.
In some parts it looks like the comparison of the global warming and the number of pirates (as my &amp;ldquo;Statistics One&amp;rdquo; professor and the book author used to say: &amp;ldquo;correlation does not imply causation&amp;rdquo;), but the whole idea behind the studies are really interesting.</description>

      <description>Book: Management 3.0: Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders by Jurgen Appelo. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I read this book in 2015 when the product director of the company I worked for suggested to buy a bunch of copies and do a book club on that book. The director (and many of us, leaders) liked the ideas here, but there were not not attractive to the rest of the directors. Needless to say that reading this didn&amp;rsquo;t change anything in how the company does things.</description>

Esse livro √© muito legal para quem n√£o conhece Rails e quer colocar a m√£o na massa criando uma aplica√ß√£o do zero. Com ele voc√™ consegue explorar uma boa parte do que √© necess√°rio para criar uma aplica√ß√£o comum usando o framework.</description>

      <description>Quem me conhece sabe como eu sou meio doido quanto a ler coisas aleat√≥rias (Google reader e artigos interessantes que eu acho perdidos por a√≠), e como eu tenho um tempo um pouco limitado, devido ao trabalho e a faculdade eu sempre tenho alguns esquemas diferentes para ler. :P
Fluxo de leitura Depois que eu comprei um Android o meu fluxo de leitura se modificou um pouco. E est√° da seguinte maneira:</description>

      <description>Hoje terminei de ler o livro da 37signals chamado Rework! E vou falar um pouco sobre a id√©ia dele aqui.
Atualmente eu fiz uma compra na Amazon em conjunto com uns amigos (@vinibaggio, @hugobarauna, @cantoniodasilva), e cogitei a compra do Rework, mas depois de uma pergunta no Twitter e algumas respostas sobre a id√©ia do livro eu resolvi n√£o comprar, pois parecia muito gerencial, e acabei optando por outros (Design Patterns In Ruby, Ruby Programming Language, The Pragmatic Programmer), que falarei em outros posts :P.</description>

      <description>Book: Silmarilion by J.R.R. Tolkien. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
This is J.R.R. Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s life work. The other known books a product of this. He was not able to finish this masterpiece, but Christopher Tolkien finished his father&amp;rsquo;s work in a great way.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, the Silmarilion is not an easy to read book. I would not recommend it to anyone who was not totally aware of the other books and still looking for more middle earth content.</description>

      <description>Aqui estou eu novamente para falar de um livro que eu li nas f√©rias! Dessa vez vou comentar sobre: &amp;ldquo;A cabe√ßa de Steve Jobs&amp;rdquo;
Sobre o livro O livro √© bem interessante e conta como Steve Jobs fez para ter o sucesso que tem atualmente, contando n√£o somente os acertos, mas tamb√©m os erros de Steve com o mercado, o que faz com que voc√™ caia na real que ele (assim como voc√™) √© apenas uma pessoa comum e que as vezes suas decis√µes fant√°sticas levavam a uma m√° situa√ß√£o.</description>

      <description>Felizmente eu estou de f√©rias da faculdade novamente, e isso me d√° um tempo livre para ler alguns livros, portanto resolvi come√ßar com ‚ÄúAnjos e Dem√¥nios‚Äú, que √© um livro que eu estou postergando a leitura faz mais de 2 anos (desde que li o c√≥digo da vinci).
Eu particularmente gosto dos livros do Dan Brown, pois em sua grande maioria s√£o hist√≥rias ‚Äúpolemicas‚Äù por misturar alguns fatos reais (que ninguem consegue provar a favor nem contra) com outros que s√£o pura fic√ß√£o.</description>

      <description>Mais um dos livros que eu consegui terminar de ler nas f√©rias! O livro fala sobre performance de front end, como fazer as suas p√°ginas carregarem mais rapidamente e fornecer uma melhor experi√™ncia para o usu√°rio.
O livro come√ßa explicando um pouco sobre o HTTP, seus m√©todos e utiliza√ß√µes, e depois inicia as sobre as 14 regras para ter um website mais perform√°tico. Eu vou tentar mostrar um pouco de cada uma das regras que o livro aborda, mas √© claro que sem os grandes detalhes, compara√ß√µes e exemplos que o livro d√°, que s√£o muito amplos e interessantes para se entender, mas vou dar uma vis√£o geral de qual √© o conte√∫do da regra, para te chamar para comprar o livro e ler (ou n√£o&amp;hellip;hehhe).</description>

      <description>Chegou o momento que eu estava esperando h√° v√°rios meses&amp;hellip;. Ap√≥s terminar de ler, vou escrever sobre O Senhor dos An√©is! :D
Todos que me conhecem sabem como eu sou apaixonado pelo mundo de O senhor dos an√©is na verdade sobre hist√≥rias medievais e o Senhor dos an√©is √© foda), e eu s√≥ tinha assistido o filme (mais de 10 vezes o primeiro, e milh√µes de vezes os outros 2) e n√£o tinha lido o livro ainda, o que me deixava inquieto, pois eu sabia muito bem que o n√≠vel de riquezas e detalhes do livro ia muito alem do que eu podia imaginar, sem contar que muita coisa foi cortada no filme (obviamente) para que se fosse feita uma boa adapta√ß√£o.</description>

      <description>H√° tempos que eu estava querendo conhecer um pouco mais do Git e nos √∫ltimos dias estava procurando um livro legal, quando me deparei com esse livro. Fiz algumas perguntas para um pessoal no Twitter como pessoalmente sobre esse livro, alguns me recomendavam, outros me passavam outros tamb√©m interessantes, e estava em d√∫vida entre comprar ou n√£o, at√© que consegui emprestado e li em 3 dias.
O livro √© bem interessante, aborda desde o mais b√°sico at√© o n√≠vel intermedi√°rio, n√£o abordando conte√∫dos t√£o avan√ßados.</description>
