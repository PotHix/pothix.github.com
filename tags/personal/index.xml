      <title>Stats for January, 2017</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post of a series that will show all the data I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting during the month. One of my goals this year is to track everything possible. These posts will help me to analyze all the data and may extract something for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new idea, I&amp;rsquo;m inspired
by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.truevalhalla.com/blog/online-income-report-057-january-2017&#34;&gt;posts like this&lt;/a&gt; from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.truevalhalla.com/about&#34;&gt;Matthew of truevalhalla.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to &lt;strong&gt;read 30 books this year&lt;/strong&gt;, so I must have an average
of 2.5 books per month. I read two this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/pothix&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/goodreads.png&#34; alt=&#34;List of books read this month&#34; title=&#34;List of books read this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both books were &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; by using audiobooks from &lt;a href=&#34;https://audible.com&#34;&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;coding&#34;&gt;Coding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To track my time coding I&amp;rsquo;m
using &lt;a href=&#34;https://wakatime.com/i/PotHix&#34;&gt;Wakatime&lt;/a&gt; (this link is a
referral, use it in case you want to try it out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using it I can see the amount of hours I spent programming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wakatime.com/@PotHix&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-coding.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hours of coding on Wakatime this month&#34; title=&#34;Hours of coding on Wakatime this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the colors in this chart, each project has it&amp;rsquo;s own color but it&amp;rsquo;s not relevant for this case. My best best day was Jan 19th, almost 12h coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can check the languages I&amp;rsquo;m using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wakatime.com/@PotHix&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-languages.png&#34; alt=&#34;Languages used during this month on Wakatime&#34; title=&#34;Languages used during this month on Wakatime&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what this &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; means. The purple one
is &lt;a href=&#34;http://elixir-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m playing with it and it&amp;rsquo;s
really great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the controversial fact. My text editors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wakatime.com/@PotHix&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/wakatime-editors.png&#34; alt=&#34;Editors used during this month on Wakatime&#34; title=&#34;Editors used during this month on Wakatime&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget about Chrome, I was testing a feature from Wakatime. But yes,
I&amp;rsquo;m using both Vim and Emacs. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;speaking&#34;&gt;Speaking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke three times this month, here is the list and descriptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://campuscode.com.br/&#34;&gt;Campus Code&lt;/a&gt;, it was opening the &lt;em&gt;Quero
ser dev&lt;/em&gt; program. I was talking about the chooses we made as
developers during our careers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.impacta.com.br&#34;&gt;Impacta&lt;/a&gt;, speaking about what what
happens behind a web request. This is the presentation that
inspired &lt;a href=&#34;https://desconstruindoaweb.com.br&#34;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://campuscode.com.br/&#34;&gt;Campus Code&lt;/a&gt;, after 6+ rehearsals I was
trying my talk &amp;ldquo;Open source behind a web request&amp;rdquo; for an actual
audience. It was my first talk in English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts&#34;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of audio programs. I have many audiobooks and podcasts in my collection and I listen to them whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my stats for this month, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;Podcast Addict&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/podcasts.png&#34; alt=&#34;Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month&#34; title=&#34;Amount of time spent listening to Podcasts this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big numbers is my total time, but look at the &amp;ldquo;January 2017&amp;rdquo; time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hours-working&#34;&gt;Hours working&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m testing &lt;a href=&#34;https://toggl.com&#34;&gt;Toggl&lt;/a&gt; to track my working hours. This
is the first month and here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/toggl-time-working.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hours working using Toggl&#34; title=&#34;Hours working using Toggl&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/1403570&#34;&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt; to
track my apps on my cellphone and personal computer. It still needs
some tuning but here are my goal of 3 productive hours per day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/rescuetime-productivetime.png&#34; alt=&#34;Goal of productive hours on RescueTime&#34; title=&#34;Goal of productive hours on RescueTime&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;physical-activity&#34;&gt;Physical activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to keep a regular physical activity. After buying a simple and cheap &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mi.com/en/miband/&#34;&gt;Mi band&lt;/a&gt; I can track it better. It&amp;rsquo;s integrated with &lt;a href=&#34;https://fit.google.com&#34;&gt;Google Fit&lt;/a&gt;, so I can extract all those nice charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the amount of steps this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-steps.png&#34; alt=&#34;Amount of steps for this month&#34; title=&#34;Amount of steps for this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distance by day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-distance.png&#34; alt=&#34;Travelled distance this month&#34; title=&#34;Travelled distance this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m also tracking my weight, which is improving! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/physical-activity-weight.png&#34; alt=&#34;My weight for this month&#34; title=&#34;My weight for this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using miband, I can also track the amount of sleep for this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/sleep.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/sleep.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Amount of sleep for this month&#34; title=&#34;Amount of sleep for this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this app does not know how to deal with sleep time when
you sleep after midnight. This is the main reason why it says I&amp;rsquo;m
going to sleep at 07:20 and I&amp;rsquo;m waking up 07:18 (???). I will try to
workaround this bug by avoiding to sleep after midnight, as I&amp;rsquo;m waking up
around 6. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tv-shows&#34;&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t watch so much TV but it&amp;rsquo;s a hobby of mine (and my wife) to
watch TV Shows on Netflix and Game of thrones on HBO when available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tvshowtime.com&#34;&gt;tvshowtime&lt;/a&gt; to track it and here is my stats for this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/tvshows.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime&#34; title=&#34;TV shows watched this month according to tvshowtime&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expenses&#34;&gt;Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;rsquo;m planning to do for a long time now but never got
the chance. I always keep track of my expenses and now I decided to
publish here as well. It will not have values (because it don&amp;rsquo;t need
to), but here is the chart for my expenses by category:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/expenses.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/stats/2017/jan/expenses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Expenses by category this month&#34; title=&#34;Expenses by category this month&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know, all categories in pt-BR. This chart is generated by a
Brazilian app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.guiabolso.com.br/&#34;&gt;GuiaBolso&lt;/a&gt; and
it&amp;rsquo;s the best I have for the moment. As you may expect, it takes a lot
of time to collect all these data, so I will keep it as is for a
while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most part of my expenses was covering the travel expenses for my
Eurotrip next of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post, so there are many details missing. The idea is
to start &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; and keep improving in the next months. As it&amp;rsquo;s not
so easy to write posts like these, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to create some
&amp;ldquo;templates&amp;rdquo; for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty good experience to see all that data together. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it goes in the next months.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oxford for Tolkien fans</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/oxford-for-tolkien-fans/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: When traveling to Europe, I decided to take 2 or 3 days to visit
Oxford. I will describe how was the experience of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien. Have read most of his books, the ones released
when he was still alive and other edited by Christopher Tolkien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://fosdem.org&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; I decided to travel around some
countries in Europe and UK. The most expensive part, the airplane tickets
(Brazil -&amp;gt; Europe), were already paid, so&amp;hellip; why not? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step of this journey would be London. Then I realized: &amp;ldquo;Why not to
visit Oxford?&amp;ldquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a historical city and Tolkien himself wrote most part of
his books there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Oxfordbus company as transport from Heathrow Airport to Oxford center. I
choose a cozy house to say via Airbnb for 3 days and 2 nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in Oxford closes really early. I got there around 4pm and there was
nothing to do anymore. I tried to visit the Bodleian Library, but it was
closing. All colleges were closed. The only thing to do is to look for a place
to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop for real was Eagle and Child. This was the pub where the Inklings
met once a week in the morning. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know the Inklings, it was a
small group which J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were members. They used to talk
about their books in these meetings. The Lord of the Rings had their first
drafts showed in this pub, probably. It&amp;rsquo;s a good place to eat, I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to be in Oxford in a Wednesday, they have extended tours around the
Bodleian Library and Radcliff camera on Wednesdays and Saturdays. There were
some good stories about it, but unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible for a
tourist to see any of the Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s manuscripts or original materials. In order
to get access to it you need to have the Readers card. In order to obtain it,
you have to pay and justify &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you need to have access to the them. So&amp;hellip; No
manuscripts for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide of the Bodleian Library did not know anything about Tolkien, just the
history behind the Radcliff camera and the Bodleian Library. The extended tour
is expensive (£24, I think) but worth the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Weston Library, where they have a treasury room with a free
exposition. There I found a original drawing from Tolkien. But the other
manuscripts were already removed because they are planning to close this
exposition (as they said&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tolkien was a teacher at Merton College, you have to pay £4 to enter there if
you want to. After asking about Tolkien places to visit, I found that none of
the places I would like to visit in there were open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the inside I could see (through the gate&amp;hellip;) the rounded table that may
have inspired the meeting that created the fellowship of the ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/oxford-for-tolkien-fans/council-of-elrond-merton.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fellowship of the ring&#34; title=&#34;Round table&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this picture thanks to my 55-250mm lens, but it is not so close from the
gate. To enter there you have to be a Merton associate (or something like
that). But is still a good place to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to visit Magdalen College (£5) to walk in the &amp;ldquo;Addison&amp;rsquo;s Walk&amp;rdquo; where
the Inklings talked about religion and where C.S Lewis was converted to
Christianity. Unfortunately, the wind was causing some threes to fall down and
they had to close the place for security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a exposition in the old library of the Magdalen College and it was
cool to see the old books. From the times they still had chains in the shelves. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good place to find Tolkien books, in case you&amp;rsquo;re interested. Go
to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Blackwell&#39;s+Bookshop/@51.7545513,-1.2554288,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x998ba5c1ca8ff22f!2sBlackwell&#39;s+Bookshop!8m2!3d51.7546524!4d-1.2555315!3m4!1s0x0:0x998ba5c1ca8ff22f!8m2!3d51.7546524!4d-1.2555315&#34;&gt;Blackwell Bookshop&lt;/a&gt; and
look for the shelf dedicated to J.R.R Tolkien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last day, I decided to go to the cemetery where Tolkien was buried
(Wolvercote cemetery). It&amp;rsquo;s not so far, but almost 1 hour walking. There are
some buses that take you there easily, just go to the bus station to get
information. I like to walk around the cities I visit, so we went there walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/oxford-for-tolkien-fans/tolkien-tombstone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tolkien tombstone&#34; title=&#34;Tombstone of J.R.R Tolkien&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a simple tombstone, nothing spectacular, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we came back walking and passed in front of the house he lived with his
family for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-things-around-oxford&#34;&gt;Other things around Oxford&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re already in Oxford, so I recommend you to visit the Blenheim Palace. It&amp;rsquo;s
expensive £23 (go by bus and buy the tickets on the bus because it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper
than buying there) but worth the price. It&amp;rsquo;s not the Highclere Castle from
Downton Abbey, but some rooms were made me think about it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walk around the Carfax Tower and the Oxford castle. I liked both structures. The
interesting part about the Carfax Tower is that it is there since 900 a.c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture for all colleges is really impressive, just walk around them if
you like it. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of these kinds of architectures, so I enjoyed walking
around them and taking pictures (yes, I like photography too!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion-about-my-tolkien-tour&#34;&gt;Conclusion about my Tolkien Tour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other pictures related to Tolkien
in &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/photos/U6T3zf66nwWAwi7G6&#34;&gt;this Google photos album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting to see more materials from Tolkien. There were no expositions
about him, the only thing I saw was a drawing. I know that all (or at least,
many) of his manuscripts are available at the Bodleian Library, but they&amp;rsquo;re not
accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city do not use the fact that Tolkien lived there as touristic
attraction. The only place referencing Tolkien was the Eagle and Child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Oxford is a good city to visit. There is a lot of history there. I just
recommend you, J.R.R. Tolkien fan, to align your expectations with what is
there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vendendo minhas coisas</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/vendendo-minhas-coisas/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/vendendo-minhas-coisas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Esse ano aconteceram algumas coisas zuadas para mim e resolvi capitalizar o
dinheiro das coisas que eu tenho e começar denovo no ano que vem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurei preços justos para tudo que estou vendendo (os links das minhas
pesquisas estão nas descrições dos produtos), mas caso alguém ache que alguma
das coisas está com um preço não-justo e estiver interessado é só entrar em
contato que negociamos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estou aproveitando para testar a plataforma do loja integrada, mas os
pagamentos eu prefiro que sejam por depósito mesmo, e se possível marcamos a
entrega pessoalmente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dá para acessar a loja pelo link &lt;a href=&#34;http://loja.pothix.com&#34;&gt;http://loja.pothix.com&lt;/a&gt;
(redireciona para a &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.lojaintegrada.com.br&#34;&gt;lojaintegrada&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espero conseguir vender essas paradas o quanto antes. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quem puder me ajudar a divulgar eu agradeço muito.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://pothix.com/post/organizando-os-feeds-do-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/organizando-os-feeds-do-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Como muitos sabem, eu sou meio doido por organização (heheh) e eu
mesmo não gosto de ficar lendo coisas que não me interessam de outros
blogs, ou seja, no blog de alguém que gosta bastante de Vim eu ter que
ficar lendo sobre paraquedismo :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora eu gostaria de além de escrever sobre coisas técnicas, escrever
também sobre os meus outros hobbies, como Motos, Shows e etc.  Alguns
deles eu até já escrevia um pouco antes, mas nem tanto, e isso já me
incomodava um pouco, por que eu sei bem que várias pessoas que seguem
o feed não gostam das mesmas coisas que eu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Então minha idéia foi simples, criei um feed só para os posts técnicos
(programação, Vim, eventos de tech, e coisas relacionadas), e o que eu
achar que não é tech eu não coloco a tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portanto, se você só quer ver os posts técnicos do meu blog, assine
&lt;a href=&#34;http://feeds.feedburner.com/PotHixTech&#34;&gt;este feed&lt;/a&gt;, e o feed atual
começa a ser o &amp;ldquo;FULL&amp;rdquo; onde terá todos os posts. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se você não liga para só ler posts técnicos e quer ler tudo que eu
colocar, é só ignorar isso tudo :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fluxo de leitura e o Android</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/fluxo-de-leitura-e-o-android/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/fluxo-de-leitura-e-o-android/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Quem me conhece sabe como eu sou meio doido quanto a ler coisas
aleatórias (Google reader e artigos interessantes que eu acho perdidos
por aí), e como eu tenho um tempo um pouco limitado, devido ao
trabalho e a faculdade eu sempre tenho alguns esquemas diferentes para
ler. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fluxo-de-leitura&#34;&gt;Fluxo de leitura&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depois que eu comprei um Android o meu fluxo de leitura se modificou
um pouco. E está da seguinte maneira:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aproveito o café da manhã para dar uma revisada no meu Google Reader pelo celular, colocando estrela nos artigos que me interessam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Termino de separar os artigos e colocar estrela nos que me interessam e marcar como lido os que não interessam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leio os artigos pequenos que estão com estrela e os artigos maiores vão para o Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E com isso eu consigo pegar meus &amp;ldquo;tempos livres&amp;rdquo; para ler um pouco
desses artigos aos poucos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;aplicações-para-android&#34;&gt;Aplicações para Android&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando comprei o celular já estava pensando em conseguir aplicações
legais para leitura justamente para ajudar a resolver esse meu
&amp;ldquo;problema&amp;rdquo;, portanto fui atrás logo cedo.  Minha primeira idéia era
simplesmente colocar um .pdf no Android e ler em qualquer leitor de
PDF normal, como o quickoffice ou até mesmo o adobereader para
Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seguindo o caminho PDF eu descobri que é um pouco desconfortável ficar
lendo PDFs em uma tela pequena, e vc precisa ficar fazendo scroll com
frequencia, dar zoom e etc, e isso deixa a leitura meio enfadonha
(sempre quis usar essa palavra :P).  Então decidi seguir outro rumo
não muito comum, vou transformar esses artigos em .epub e ler em um
leitor de epubs para Android.  Os dois leitores legais que eu
encontrei foram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.reader.books.laputa.ui&#34;&gt;Laputa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.aldiko.android&#34;&gt;Aldiko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primeiramente tentei algo com o &lt;strong&gt;Laputa&lt;/strong&gt; que parecia um iBooks para
Android. Todo cheio de frescuras de desenhar quando você está virando
a página para parecer um livro e tal, mas eu prefiro as coisas mais
simples :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ao mesmo tempo já estava testando o &lt;strong&gt;Aldiko&lt;/strong&gt; tambem e comparando
funcionalidades. O Aldiko tinha as mesmas funcionalidades só que com
menos frescuras e algumas coisas a mais que realmente fazem a
diferença, como o ajuste de brilho tocando o lado esquerdo da tela,
por exemplo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E no fim das contas acabei decidindo usar o &lt;strong&gt;Aldiko&lt;/strong&gt; como meu leitor
padrão, por ter boas funcionalidades e não ter frescuras. Mas depois
disso ainda tinha um problema para resolver&amp;hellip;Tinha que transformar em
.epub e colocar no Android toda vez que eu quisesse ler um texto nele,
e isso provavelmente ia ser uma tarefa muito chata&amp;hellip;Se não fosse o
&lt;strong&gt;Calibre&lt;/strong&gt;! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;calibre&#34;&gt;Calibre&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O &lt;strong&gt;Calibre&lt;/strong&gt; é uma aplicação para organização de ebooks que provê uma
maneira fácil para editar metatags e exportar para diversos formatos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ultima versão (se vc usa Ubuntu, não instale por apt-get que a
versão é antiga, &lt;a href=&#34;http://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux&#34;&gt;instale diretamente do
site&lt;/a&gt;) reconhece
perfeitamente o meu Milestone e envia para a pasta eBooks/import, que
é a pasta que o Aldiko usa para importar ebooks! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portanto, utilizando essas ferramentas ficou muito fácil de seguir o
meu fluxo de leitura:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ler um artigo com estrela&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se for grande imprimir em pdf (geralmente uso um plugin do Chrome chamado iReader, que formata muito bem para leitura/impressão)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;converter o .pdf para .epub no calibre e já enviar direto para o Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no Aldiko importar os novos livros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E pronto! Agora tenho os artigos que eu quero ler em boa fonte, como
se fosse um ebook comum! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espero que seja útil para mais alguem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saldo final das férias de julho</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/saldo-final-das-ferias-de-julho/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Eu sempre digo que a faculdade me atrasa bastante, por que eu não
consigo estudar/fazer um monte de coisas que eu tenho vontade para me
dedicar as coisas que a faculdade me obriga a fazer. Se a faculdade é
bom ou ruim não é discussão para esse post, mas resolvi postar a
quantidade de coisas que eu consegui fazer nessas férias aproveitando
que eu não precisava me preocupar com a faculdade, assim deixando o
tempo da noite e a cabeça menos preocupada:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;leituras&#34;&gt;Leituras:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminei de ler O senhor dos anéis! ( faltavam mais de 13 capítulos, sendo que cada um tem cerca de 20 folhas )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminei de ler o High Performance Websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;screencasts&#34;&gt;Screencasts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assisti o screencast antigão ( na época do lançamento do Rails 2 ) do Akita sobre RESTful Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screencast sobre RSpec Basics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screncast sobre RSpec Mocks and Stubs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;eventos&#34;&gt;Eventos:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/events/encontro-de-numero-5-do-guru-sp&#34; title=&#34;5 encontro do Guru-sp&#34;&gt;Encontro do Guru-sp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../development/gamejam&#34; title=&#34;GameJam&#34;&gt; GameJam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;trabalhos&#34;&gt;Trabalhos:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iniciei um novo projeto pessoal ainda em back mas falarei o que é em breve e já estou terminando&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trabalhei um pouco mais e aprendi bastante coisa no Ikwa nos momentos mais tranquilos com a equipe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;blog&#34;&gt;Blog:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consegui postar sobre os jogos que eu estava jogando no PSP ( &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/games/gamereview-diablo&#34; title=&#34;Diablo&#34;&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt; e &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/games/gamereview-spiderman-friend-or-foe&#34; title=&#34;Spiderman Friend or Foe&#34;&gt;Spiderman&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalmente postei meu &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/books/bookreview-pragmatic-version-control-using-git&#34; title=&#34;Pragmatic Version Control using Git&#34;&gt;review do Pragmatic version control with Git&lt;/a&gt; que já fazia meses que estava de molho&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postei meu &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/books/bookreview-lord-of-the-rings&#34; title=&#34;Lord of the rings&#34;&gt;review do O senhor dos anéis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postei meu &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/books/bookreview-high-performance-websites&#34; title=&#34;High Performance Websites &#34;&gt;review sobre o High Performance Websites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finalmente fiz meu primeiro &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/development/um-pouco-sobre-o-vim&#34; title=&#34;Um pouco sobre o Vim&#34;&gt;post sobre Vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postei sobre &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/development/instalando-o-allegro-4-2-2-no-linux-x86&#34; title=&#34;Como instalar o Allegro 4.2.2 no Linux x86&#34;&gt;como instalar o Allegro 4.2.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postei sobre &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/development/gamejam&#34; title=&#34;GameJam&#34;&gt;como foi o GameJam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postei sobre o &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/events/encontro-de-numero-5-do-guru-sp&#34; title=&#34;5 encontro do Guru-sp&#34;&gt;Evento do Guru-sp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;open-source&#34;&gt;Open Source&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incluí mais uma funcionalidade no meu &lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/anti-ie6-army&#34; title=&#34;Anti IE6 Army&#34;&gt;plugin do Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiz algumas &lt;a href=&#34;http://pt-br.gitready.com/avancado/2009/01/15/piecemeal-staging.html&#34; title=&#34;Uma das traduções&#34;&gt;traduções para o Git Ready&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escrevi um pouco para o &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/vimbook/&#34; title=&#34;Projeto Vimbook&#34;&gt;vimbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribui para o plugin &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/dcrec1/remarkable_paperclip/tree/master&#34; title=&#34;Remarkable Paperclip no GitHub&#34;&gt;remarkable_paperclip&lt;/a&gt; do Diego Carrion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;game-develo&#34;&gt;Game Develo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parcicipei de um concurso de desenvolvimento de games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aproveitando o concurso consegui aprender bastante sobre Allegro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiz networking com um pessoal legal que tambem conhece bastante coisa sobre games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Além de tudo isso tive que fazer um trabalho que a professora ( que
não tem noção alguma ) deixou para entregar depois das férias, e
estudar para Estrutura de Dados que não fui muito bem ( o curso é
anual ) e vou ter que melhorar até o final do ano. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essas férias me foram muito custosas em termos de saúde
tambem&amp;hellip; Gastei mais de 1000 reais somente com saúde! :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bem, é isso! Acho que não dá para responder: &amp;ldquo;Ahh&amp;hellip;Não fiz nada
nessas férias&amp;rdquo; :P&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Projeto de fevereiro</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/projeto-de-fevereiro/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/projeto-de-fevereiro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;No mês de fevereiro eu estive envolvido com um projeto bem
interessante na &lt;a href=&#34;ainda vamos
trabalhar mais em nosso site 😛&#34;&gt;empresa que estou trabalhando&lt;/a&gt;, que foi feito em Python / Django e
deveria gerar páginas estáticas ( exigência do projeto ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tivemos um prazo muito curto para tudo que deveria ser feito, o que
gerou uma grande quantidade de trabalho fora do horário e dos dias
comuns. Entre o começo e o fim do projeto, tínhamos o carnaval,
portanto tivemos que deixar &lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mHmy-foJwpAQDav4MeKhpA?feat=directlink&#34; title=&#34;Veja a alegria!&#34;&gt;nossos espíritos carnavalescos&lt;/a&gt; guardados
e partir para o trabalho árduo no feriado até horas indeterminadas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O ambiente de trabalho era bem legal, trabalhamos onde chamávamos de
The Rubens, que tinha tudo o que precisávamos para nos sentir a
vontade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/jVW8dd3JY7WCrCz0hiV_UQ?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/projeto_fevereiro_instrumento.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Foto de uma Sitar no The Rubens&#34; title=&#34;Sitar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-vMfDbnPkfAvctXMJRjzWA?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/projeto_fevereiro_violao.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Foto dos violões do Rubens&#34; title=&#34;Violões&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NoofOiWk-FpJKbQaEJ0jHA?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/projeto_fevereiro_biblioteca.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Foto dos livros da biblioteca do Rubens&#34; title=&#34;Biblioteca&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviamente nada melhor do que instrumentos (para uma leve descontraída
antes de voltar ao trabalho árduo), pessoas motivadas, barrinhas de
cereal, livros (vários nomes interessantíssimos nessa biblioteca!) e
programação! A única coisa que não tínhamos era tempo o suficiente
para fazer tudo tranquilamente, mas aproveitamos bastante o tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/C9GP7QYcyrNlXOIvbH6B7Q?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bXWgXlrMJ55dk3wesmhpZx-n1iFNfLRJu_kD-wIF0YI=w720-h900-no&#34; alt=&#34;Foto do relógio marcando quase duas horas da manhã quando estava indo para casa&#34; title=&#34;Olha o horário&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trabalhamos todos os dias durante o carnaval, sábado, domingo, de
madrugada, e em qualquer outro horário que fosse possivel ( hehe ).
Nosso repositório Git já estava bem legal no gráfico de Network do
GitHub, entre emaranhados coloridos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durante o caminho tivemos que enfrentar alguns contratempos, como o
calor infernal, a falta de energia elétrica, a quantidade de novidades
para lidar, tanto com o Python / Django, como com o Git e outras coisas
mais!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WKEYkHv63No08HDzdQNmpw?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WvzTz_kVWsQ/SdOp0dF8fcI/AAAAAAAABiU/KJl8daqu0uA/w720-h900-no/moto_0441.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PotHix usando a mascara do Darth Vader&#34; title=&#34;Darth Vader!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nenhum dos contratempos pode nos barrar muito! Com o calor vieram os
ventiladores, com a falta de energia veio o nosso local de trabalho
provisório (só durante aquele dia), e o prazo curto nós conseguimos
vencer com muitas barrinhas de cereal e horas de trabalho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahhh! É claro que no meio de toda a correria tinhamos que ter tambem o
nossos momentos de descontração, alem do nosso amigo Darth Vader que
aparecia na hora dos conflitos do merge… hehehe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entre nossas descontrações (geralmente pouco antes de ir embora,
22:00h) tinhamos sessão violão e Sitar, ou momento Guitar Hero, ou
jogo de alvo + dardos, um pouco de tiro com o &lt;a href=&#34;http://openarena.ws/&#34; title=&#34;Open Arena!&#34;&gt;Open Arena&lt;/a&gt; entre
outras coisinhas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estavamos trabalhando com 2 Macs, 1 Windows e 1 Linux, portanto sempre
tinha as boas e velhas conversas sobre o melhor sistema operacional, que
é claro que o Linux é o melhor (haha, pelo menos aqui eu sou o root
para dizer isso… hehehe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enfim…Foi um projeto corrido, dormimos pouco, trabalhamos muito,
consideramos feriados e finais de semana como dias normais de
trabalho, mas…Como diria o &lt;a href=&#34;algo parecido com isso&#34;&gt;Rubens&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;É dos projetos mais difíceis que ficam as suas ótimas recordações&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portanto, na minha humilde opinião, se você tiver a oportunidade de
entrar naquele projeto difícil com bons amigos, faça que vai valer a
pena! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Bem lembrado pelo Nelson! Nós temos o nosso vídeo de
comemoração, quando terminavamos nossas features:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dia difícil</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/dia-dificil/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/dia-dificil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hoje o dia foi $#&amp;amp;&amp;amp;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/photos/+WillianMolinari/albums/5300186538520936977?banner=pwa&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-o-d1Cuoqs4U/SY4LyeeCslI/AAAAAAAABSk/h8ZKw09LENY/w1200-h900-no/S7301819.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Foto da minha garagem cheia de água de enchente&#34; title=&#34;Água de enchente&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atualmente moro em Diadema (que não é uma cidade ruim como muitos
ouvem falar), e tenho o azer de morar próximo a um córrego, que a
prefeitura promete canalizar há mais de 10 anos, e agora parece que
finalmente o projeto começou a andar, mas enquanto o projeto não é
concluído de vez a coisa ficou pior que o normal&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No momento ruim eu tirei &lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/20090207Enchente?feat=directlink&#34; title=&#34;Fotos da enchente maldita&#34;&gt;algumas fotos&lt;/a&gt; (o que sempre faço nesses casos) para
mostrar a situação da coisa&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pois é&amp;hellip; Já tivemos coisas bem piores que essa no passado, mas a
situação é muito ruim independente do quão grande for a desgraça.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoje para tudo calhou para dar errado e deixar minha cabeça
doendo&amp;hellip; Foi como um &amp;ldquo;efeito coringa&amp;rdquo;, que diz que você pode ficar
doido igual o coringa se tudo de ruim acontecer com você de uma hora
para a outra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estava eu estudando algoritmo para fazer o meu EP (exercício programa
) do curso de verão, quando o tempo começa a fechar ( ou seja&amp;hellip;Muitos
relâmpagos e computador desligado, pois já tive muita coisa queimada
por causa de raio ) o que já me deixa em alerta para muita coisa, e
meus pais tinham saído.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pois bem&amp;hellip;A chuva forte começa, e junto com ela os relampagos que eu
tinha previsto, e quando eu vi como a chuva estava caindo já me toquei
que ia dar problema! Quando vou ligar para o meu pai ex-Sysadmin do
meu ex-trampo me liga dizendo que o nosso ex-chefe ligou dizendo que o
site está fora do ar, e ele está na estrada nesse momento e não tem
como ver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situação ótima&amp;hellip;. Preparar comportas para segurar a enchente, um
carro na garagem que precisa ser retirado, relampagos ameaçando o meu
computador a cada momento, 3 servidores virtualizados fora do
ar&amp;hellip; Hora de correr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aos poucos fui contendo a situação&amp;hellip; Meu pai chegou e tirou o carro
enquanto eu fui arrumando a comporta, depois corri para ver os
servidores (com a ajuda do SysAdmin por telefone), e enquanto
iniciava alguns serviços eu corria lá embaixo para ver como estava a
situação para tentar ajudar em alguma coisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fim das contas temos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uma rua lotada de lama, que a prefeitura simplesmente ignora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 servidores no ar novamente e o site funcionando (graças ao SysAdmin, claro!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Felizmente tudo em ordem e nada queimou (como da ultima vez que perdi uma placa mãe, telefone, modem e outras coisas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Um cara totalmente stressado e mal humorado (eu)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essa confusão toda (principalmente a enchente) me deixa muito mal
humorado, e o pior de tudo é saber que não posso fazer nada a
respeito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O que tentei fazer foi mandar um
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diadema.sp.gov.br/apache2-default/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;amp;id=24&amp;amp;amp;Itemid=29&#34; title=&#34;Página com os contatos da prefeitura&#34;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;
para a prefeitura de Diadema perguntando se eles ao menos podem &amp;ldquo;fazer
o favor&amp;rdquo; de mandar algo/alguem para limpar a rua após as enchentes até
que o projeto que supostamente resolverá os nossos problemas com as
enchentes esteja terminado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora o que posso fazer é aguardar uma resposta deles ( se é que vão
responder ) e seguir rumo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New year is coming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Estou apenas postando para dizer que nesse novo ano eu pretendo postar
mais sobre programação! Essa é a primeira virada de ano desse blog,
então resolvi postar meus &amp;ldquo;planos&amp;rdquo; para o próximo ano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como o blog é novo eu comecei a escrever faz pouco tempo e estou
pegando experiência aos poucos, e talvez agora nesse novo ano a
qualidade dos posts aumente! (ou não&amp;hellip;heheh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Não sei bem qual rumo minha vida vai seguir nesse novo ano, o que eu
vou ter que aprender e estudar, talvez eu tenha que aprender coisas
que eu não tinha planejado e isso pode tomar uma boa parte do meu
tempo, mas eu pretendo postar todos os meus estudos aqui, portanto
terei algum material interessante aqui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esse ano estarei em alguns eventos por aqui (como todo ano), e eu
pretendo postar sobre eles aqui no blog! Um evento que já está com
minha presença confirmada é o
&lt;a href=&#34;http://campusparty.com.br/index.php/oevento.html&#34; title=&#34;Campus Party&#34;&gt;Campus Party Brasil&lt;/a&gt;,
que parece que vai ser bem lega, além da conexão monstruosa que terei
lá vou encontrar umas pessoas bem legais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eu estarei fazendo o curso de
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ime.usp.br/~verao/index.php?secao=difusao&amp;amp;amp;anoID=1&amp;amp;amp;&#34; title=&#34;Curso de verão do IME/USP&#34;&gt;verão da USP&lt;/a&gt;
(tópicos de programação) no mês de janeiro no período noturno,
portanto se alguem for fazer tambem me avise que nos encontraremos por
lá! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bem&amp;hellip;É isso! Um feliz ano novo a todos os leitores do Blog e amigos e
nos veremos em 2009!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Concurso Quarto mais Nerd</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/concurso-quarto-mais-nerd/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/concurso-quarto-mais-nerd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bem&amp;hellip;Estava eu aproveitando as férias (tanto da faculdade como as
férias coletivas do trabalho) para colocar as coisas em ordem,
começando pelo meu quarto que é o lugar da casa que eu passo mais
tempo e eu gosto de manter bem organizado, portanto já tratei de
aproveitar meu tempo livre para deixar ele do jeito que eu queria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprei uma pequena estante para colocar mais livros e outras coisas
legais, encaixotei várias coisas que eu quase nunca vou usar, e joguei
2 sacolas de papéis e outras coisas inúteis fora. Com isso tudo acabei
até achando 2 adesivos legais (um do Quake III e outro do Unreal
Tournament GotY) que eu tinha para colar no&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/a-tiDhsHv5pIkSce68oH7w?feat=directlink&#34; title=&#34;Adesivo do Unreal Tournament&#34;&gt;meu capacete&lt;/a&gt;
e na &lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tif9whzrOfu3PdnDx-DRfg?feat=directlink&#34; title=&#34;Adesivo do Quake III&#34;&gt;minha moto&lt;/a&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fim das contas finalmente consegui deixar o meu quarto como eu
queria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/QuartoNerd?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/quarto_nerd1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;NerdRoom1&#34; title=&#34;NerdRoom1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/QuartoNerd?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/quarto_nerd2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;NerdRoom2&#34; title=&#34;NerdRoom2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/Willian.molinari/QuartoNerd?feat=directlink&#34; title=&#34;NerdRoom&#34;&gt;mais fotos aqui&lt;/a&gt;[](&lt;a href=&#34;http://pothix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/s7301132.jpg&#34;&gt;http://pothix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/s7301132.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acho que consegue me descrever bastante:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fora da mesa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violão e guitarra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posters dos 3 filmes d&amp;rdquo;O Senhor dos Anéis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mochila preta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na mesa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vários porta cds com DVDs de arquivos e outras coisas mais&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Um porta cd com alguns cds de musica como Metallica, Bach ( da coleção da folha se não me engano ) e outros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palm e teclado ao lado do monitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roteador Wireless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pastinha do Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livro de C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na estante:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peças e relógio de xadrez da Jaehrig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabuleiro de xadrez portátil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mangás Sakura Card Captors (curto esse esquema de cartas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pasta com muitas cartas de Magic - the Gathering (na parte de baixo da estante)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alguns livros: O senhor dos anéis - Edição completa, Universidade Hacker, Repensando a web com Rails, Servidores Unix&amp;hellip;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Várias revistas: Linux Magazine, Revista Locaweb, Revista WWW&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Várias apostilas e livros impressos: Hackerzine, Guia do Linux 7 do Carlos Morimoto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pastas de desenhos ( faz muito tempo que não desenho algo, mas fica a recordação de quando desenhava )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caderno e pasta da faculdade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em cima da estante:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crachás dos eventos que eu participei (faltando alguns que se perderam)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E aí que vem a parte que eu queria chegar!:D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aqui é o maior concurso de todos os tempos, se você tem um quarto tão
nerd como o meu tire umas fotos dele e post aqui para eu ver, e quem
sabe você pode ganhar&amp;hellip; humm&amp;hellip;.. adivinhe&amp;hellip;. SiiimmM!! Toda a honra e
a glória de ter um quarto mais nerd que o meu&amp;hellip; E o meu respeito
tambem, que não vale tanta coisa assim, mas pelo menos vc vai se
divertir! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coloquem as fotos no picasa/flickr/ImageShare/QualquerOutroQueVcConheça e poste os links
aqui nos comentários.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First post in English here</title>
      <link>http://pothix.com/post/first-post-in-english-here/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi international friends! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just posting to inform that I want to post some content in English
too! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make a RSS Feed only for my English posts, so you
don&amp;rsquo;t need to view my portuguese posts on your feed reader. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As everyone knows, my English is not so good, but I think you can
understand me well! Any English errors (I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will have a lot of
them) please tell me and I&amp;rsquo;ll correct it asap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to have you following this blog! :)&lt;/p&gt;
