      <description>This post is the updated version of the one I wrote in 2019. Instead of changing the previous one, I decided to create an updated version based on that.
From time to time, I receive questions about my productivity workflow and I think it will be useful to have it written down somewhere. This post will describe how I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with it in 2021.
Tool As you probably know, I work for Doist for some time now, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Todoist user since 2007, so the my tool of choice is quite obvious.</description>

      <description>From time to time, I receive questions about my productivity workflow, so I decided to write it down here. Keep in mind it&amp;rsquo;s a living thing and may change with time, but what I&amp;rsquo;m documenting here is what I&amp;rsquo;m using right now.
