      <description>A lot happened since my last post and all parts are already here! ðŸ˜ƒ
It was expected that I would not have that much time to work on the keyboard when all the parts arrive, this will be a long journey. The only thing that I wanted to do as soon as possible was to check if the products were in a good condition.
These are cheap parts coming from China in a month-long journey, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to check if they are working as expected while I still can open a dispute with the seller if something is wrong.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a keyboard that would be great to take with me when I&amp;rsquo;m not working from home for some days. I finally found the Iris keyboard that seems to be exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.

      <description>I just bought an Atreus keyboard and I&amp;rsquo;m now configuring my own firmware.
To do that, I&amp;rsquo;m using the qmk_firmware.
I&amp;rsquo;m adding a new file as a layout (link here) and I have to change tmk_core/common/avr/bootloader.c to be able to compile it:
-uint32_t reset_key __attribute__ ((section (&amp;quot;.noinit&amp;quot;))); +uint32_t reset_key __attribute__ ((section (&amp;quot;.noinit,\&amp;quot;aw\&amp;quot;,@nobits;&amp;quot;))); After that, I just had to get the keyboard to the reset mode via fn + ESC (to change the layout) and then pressed the RESET button.</description>
