      <title>Review of Brave New World</title>

      <description>Book: Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
People usually mention Brave New World along with [[book/1984]], so I had this one in my list for a long time now. Now that I read it, I can totally understand why both books are &amp;ldquo;related&amp;rdquo;, even with complete different plots.
Brave New World is about a dystopian future where humans are created to be happy. Things are engineered, so people will not feel unhappy and stability of the society as a whole is maintained.</description>

      <description>Book: How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion by Derek Sivers. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠ê‚≠êÔ∏è.
Another great book. I really like the content Derek produces on his blog and books. It&amp;rsquo;s usually dense and full of meaning, there are almost no fillers.
The proposal here is cool: there are many ways to live, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to choose one, you can pick many! All of them are valid ways to live a meaningful life.</description>

      <description>Book: Software Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time by Titus Winters. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It was a great book to read. It&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of book you read and start applying stuff at your current job. We all must remember we&amp;rsquo;re not Google, and many things mentioned there are great, but only applies to their context.
With that said, I quite enjoyed the book. I was curious about Google&amp;rsquo;s structure, and it&amp;rsquo;s mind-blowing the amount of problems specific to that scale.</description>

      <description>This is another post of my dactyl series. This time I&amp;rsquo;m going write about the process to make the 3D printed case, and prepare it for the keyboard.
Unfortunately, the process of assembling the keyboard is taking much longer than I anticipated. Being a parent of twins takes a lot of energy, and my predictions were very distant from the truth (for a change!). For this reason, I&amp;rsquo;m posting a step by step of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with this dactyl project.</description>

      <title>How to read Tolkien, in my experience</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, and It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time friends ask me about how to read Tolkien books. I even discussed this on Twitter because of some misconceptions people have about some of his book. To make things clear, I decided to write this with my opinion on the topic.
Do not pick a book at random Tolkien has a long list of published books, some of them he published in life, but most of them were published postmortem, edited by his son Christopher Tolkien.</description>

      <description>Last month I finished the final book I wanted to read about The Dark Tower Series. I wrote reviews for all books, but I also want to write one single post about the story as a whole.
I will try to not write spoilers here, especially for the main plot, but I may touch some points that I feel are quite interesting and you may want to experience yourself, especially in the Song of Susannah, so be warned.</description>

      <description>Book: The Sleep Lady&amp;rsquo;s Good Night, Sleep Tight: Gentle Proven Solutions to Help Your Child Sleep without Leaving Them to Cry-it-Out  by Kim West. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
This is not a book I read because I was excited to read it. It&amp;rsquo;s a book I read to make my nights less bad and try to understand how to improve the life with babies. I read this after a friend mentioned it had sections on how to deal with multiples.</description>

      <description>Book: Polished Ruby Programming: Build better software with more intuitive, maintainable, scalable, and high-performance Ruby code by Jeremy Evans. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I got a contact from Packtpub about this book. The deal was to receive the book for free in exchange for an honest review. Here I am, just finished the book and will write about it.
The book is quite good, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good information there, and I would totally recommend to someone investing in Ruby.</description>

      <description>This is a post I&amp;rsquo;m postponing since 2016. üòÖ
I built a case for my Kindle using a book with a nice cover that a friend gave me &amp;ldquo;for sacrifice&amp;rdquo;. The process was simple and the result is great IMO. I will describe the step by step here in case you want to do one for yourself.
This is the book I got:

      <description>Book: The Little Sisters of Eluria (The Dark Tower, #0.5) by Stephen King. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fun story for those who are into the Dark Tower series. It&amp;rsquo;s a short story actually, and brings a bit more about Roland&amp;rsquo;s early adventures, happening a bit before &amp;ldquo;The Gunslinger&amp;rdquo;.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t add much to the whole story other than just showing a bit more of a random place in the Mid-World, but it&amp;rsquo;s still an enjoyable story.</description>

      <description>Book: The Wind Through the Keyhole by Stephen King. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I wish I have read this book in chronological order. The book is not bad, but reading it right after finishing the series just because it was released afterwards was not a good call. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if I would have enough motivation to continue reading the series if I read this book right after book 4.</description>

      <description>Book: The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7) by Stephen King. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
√öltimo livro da s√©rie, tamb√©m lido (ouvido!) em Portugu√™s, ent√£o vamos ao review em pt-BR.
Eu estava bem curioso com o fim da hist√≥ria e como as coisas se resolveriam com a torre, o ka-tet, Mordred, o Rei Rubro, etc. Tamb√©m estava preparado para muita coisa, dado que √© um livro do Stephen King.
A forma que o King construiu os personagens foi fant√°stica e me deixou bem apegado a eles.</description>

      <description>Book: The Lottery by Shirley Jackson. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I decided to read The Lottery after reading The Waste Lands (The Dark Tower, #3. They mention the book because of a situation happening in Lud, and they call it &amp;ldquo;Shirley&amp;rsquo;s nightmare&amp;rdquo;. I took some notes about it and added this short story to my reading list.
It&amp;rsquo;s funny how random the situation is in Lud when the plot is revealed, but their case was much more complicated üòÖ.</description>

      <description>Book: The Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allan Poe. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I decided to read this book after reading Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower, #6). This book was mentioned because the &amp;ldquo;Red Death&amp;rdquo; was described there too, so I was curious to read the original story.
It&amp;rsquo;s all about a prince defying the disease by locking his people inside their castle walls with enough supplies and goodies. They do &amp;ldquo;masked parties inside.</description>

      <description>I love to listen to audiobooks (article in pt-BR), and I&amp;rsquo;m was an Audible subscriber for many years, just pausing my subscription because I have way too many books (~150) already and need some time to clear the queue. üôÇ
Audible is the best service to listen to audiobooks, no doubts here from my side, but sometimes I get audiobooks from other medias. As an example, I have 3 books from Pragmatic Programmers downloaded as mp3 files and I must find my way on how to listen to them.</description>

      <description>This is a quick post for any Logitech MX master 2 (any version, really) owner having problems with their mouse. If your mouse is not moving at all but buttons are still working, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance your problem has an easy fix.
There&amp;rsquo;s a video (in pt-BR) about that if you prefer doing it more interactively, but in summary: The [hidden] thumb button is the problem. It gets stuck and messes up everything.</description>

From time to time, I receive questions about my productivity workflow and I think it will be useful to have it written down somewhere. This post will describe how I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with it in 2021.
Tool As you probably know, I work for Doist for some time now, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Todoist user since 2007, so the my tool of choice is quite obvious.</description>

      <description>Note-taking is my current obsession, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to talk about it here. üòÉ
How it started Last year I was talking to my friend Diego Eis about his note-taking workflow. I knew he was doing that for a long time but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the advantages of doing this. He described his workflow but I was still not convinced it would be useful for me at the time.
When January came, I saw a post by Caffo talking about Roam Research and how he was using it to build his blog.</description>

What a surprise! I enjoyed listening to this book. I have the whole series of books (printed version) here and decided to listen to the first one some years ago.

      <description>Book: The Life‚ÄëChanging Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I like the book and there are very few things I disagree with the author. I think it&amp;rsquo;s too much to talk to objects, but I understand where this is coming from. In my opinion, just holding the object is enough, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t talk to them.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to remove all objects from your bad/purse every day.</description>

LastPass I&amp;rsquo;m using LastPass for many years now. A lot of people say that LastPass is not a good password manager, it has bugs, it&amp;rsquo;s ugly, it has too many trackers, yada, yada, yada.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of group chats. The current app I use the most for group chats (and direct messages as well) is Telegram. I even created some group chats for topics I like (mechanical keyboards, note taking and productivity, Books and audiobooks, Money and investing, etc.).
I take group chats (and communities) more seriously than I should and I make sure chats are moderated and following their topic, otherwise, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense to have chats split by topic.</description>

      <description>Some context I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Magic The Gathering (or MTG) since the first time I played it in 2004. Even before 2004, I remember seeing some cards a friend had and being totally amazed, even without understanding how the game worked.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t play much when I was a kid because these cards were (and some still are) very expensive. In 2007 I found some people to play and I bought some new cards (cheap ones).</description>

      <description>Book: Tolkien‚Äôs Ordinary Virtues, by Mark Eddy Smith. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I‚Äôm a big fan of Tolkien (if you follow me or my blog, you probably already know that) and decided to give a chance to this one even knowing it was totally related to religion and it‚Äôs not my thing anymore.
The book is about Christian comparisons between The Lord of the Rings and some virtues shown in the Bible. I know talking took his Catholic religion very seriously and was even raised by a Priest after his mother passed away, so it would be nice to see the book again through these lenses.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time I had to use HTTPS for local development and had to do the whole setup of self-signed certificates. It&amp;rsquo;s a painful process that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a good ROI for the developer.
One day, after being sick of doing this every time, I decided to do some research for an easy way to workaround this. That was when I found the thisisunsafe hack.
If you&amp;rsquo;re using Chrome (or chromium) you can type thisisunsafe when you access your development app complaining about HTTPS certificates.</description>

I just read the book When and it mentioned this book. The idea was so interesting that I decided to give it a try.
What first caught my attention was the pattern of the peak, through, rebound everywhere. It&amp;rsquo;s not everywhere because we&amp;rsquo;re just mentioning artists here. I believe a similar pattern tends to emerge whenever people have control over their time.</description>

      <description>The GitHub CLI is been a major time saver for me. I was skeptical about its usage in the beginning but it proved to be very useful.
Cloning When I want to download a new repository, instead of typing the whole URL or going to the browser to find the repository, I just type:
 gh repo clone name-of-the-repository  It works out of the box if the repo is mine.</description>

      <description>üí° Quick thought post. A bigger tweet but on my own platform.
I&amp;rsquo;m co-authoring a book about Rust and was reviewing an example about enums. My plan was to use some sort of reference to J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy world (because I really like it). I was considering using something like this:
enum Race { Elf, Dwarf, Men, Hobbit, Ent } PS: I&amp;rsquo;m only considering the free-peoples of middle earth for this enum.</description>

      <description>A lot happened since my last post and all parts are already here! üòÉ
It was expected that I would not have that much time to work on the keyboard when all the parts arrive, this will be a long journey. The only thing that I wanted to do as soon as possible was to check if the products were in a good condition.
These are cheap parts coming from China in a month-long journey, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to check if they are working as expected while I still can open a dispute with the seller if something is wrong.</description>

I read this book two times. The first time I had no context and was just looking for something to improve myself. The second time I read it to review everything I used and implemented so I could quote the book when writing an article about how to manage your energy to be more effective.
The book provides amazing insights if you like to base your decisions on scientific research.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret to anyone that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. I have 3 versions of this book. A translated version (pt-BR), the original version in English, and the audiobook. It&amp;rsquo;s no news that it would be a 5 star book to me.
I just listened to the Inklings book by Humphrey Carpenter, so it was the best time to also listen to this one (yes, I went for the Audiobook).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien and also the concept of the Inklings. I have my own spin-off of this group with some friends but instead of discussing literature, we just take some time to have some deep conversation about anything.</description>

This is a great book for sure. I started reading it in 2017 but never find the time to read it. Now, thanks to having two babies at home, I have enough time to read while waiting for them to sleep. :)
There are many things I like about this book. The first is the comparisons with C and C++ since both authors are/were C/C++ developers.</description>

Great book! It&amp;rsquo;s short and straight to the point.
In summary, we should emphasize more with other people and understand what they are really trying to say. Sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t communicate well and it&amp;rsquo;s up to someone to find out what is the problem and raise the right questions.
This book feels even more important now that we have more people working remotely.</description>

It was a suggestion from a friend when I published the review of Don&amp;rsquo;t Panic: Taking Control of Anxiety Attacks, as he found the content to be complimentary.
I liked the book overall. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how the author shows some scientific facts of the &amp;ldquo;positive thinking&amp;rdquo; which contradicts the current collective thinking. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything against positive thinking, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure positive thinking alone will not do much.</description>

A good book and exactly what I needed, thanks for the recommendation, Rafael Rosa!
Some people said it seems like a Rust programming language book because of the word &amp;ldquo;panic&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s actually related to panic/anxiety attacks. It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time I suffer from anxiety but it&amp;rsquo;s the first time I felt the panic attack symptoms, so I decided to read more about it.</description>

A short and good book. After reading Letters from a Stoic, I got the recommendation of this book as well and it was worth listening to it. This book makes me think about the way I&amp;rsquo;m living my life and how I&amp;rsquo;m using my time (not focusing enough?).

A good book. It seems like a summary of the whole enchiridion. After reading Seneca, I decided to try Epictetus. These books are usually very dense and require some time to think about, so I decided to not go with the long form of the enchiridion. I do not regret it; it was a good reading/listening.</description>

I was expecting a bit more about this book but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is just a problem with my expectations. The book is a collection of letters from Seneca to Lucilius, and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what you should expect from it. Seneca was a wise man and these letters contain great pieces of advice. Many of these advices are still valid today, but some makes much more sense when you consider the whole context in which Seneca was at the time.</description>

      <description>Book: Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
This book was in my reading list for a while. After an exam that requires pupil dilatation, I decided to go for the audiobook as it would not require any notes. :)
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the influence of Norse Mythology in some things. I particularly noted that Ragnarok mentions the coldest winter, which is also mentioned in ASOIAF as something the is near to the end of the world.</description>

      <description>Book: Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility by Patty McCord. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good book but I was expecting more from it. I think it happened because I had the chance to attend a workshop with Patty and it was very good. My feeling is that the book was not bringing that much news for me.
I part I like the most about this book is how Netflix &amp;ldquo;considers their employees as adults&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Book: Remote: Office Not Required by David Heinemeier Hansson. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
The interesting part of reading this book is that I&amp;rsquo;m currently living most part of it in the past 2 years. :)
The book itself is a little bit outdated as it was written in 2013 and we had a very different scenario then. They mention it in the first chapter, BTW.
I found it to be a little repetitive as well, they are not very pragmatic about the content and decided to mention things over and over again so you can open the book in any particular chapter and use it as a reference (at least that&amp;rsquo;s what I felt).</description>

This is a book I can see myself writing. I would say that around 80% of the things said here regarding a personal organization I already practice since I was a child. The ones about decluttering I learned many years ago when my home was robbed and I decided to get rid of [almost] everything that was left.</description>

A nice and informative book. It&amp;rsquo;s not outstanding but I found it to have great information about how data can change the way we live, especially in this case where human lives may be in danger. The whole thing about the way the U.S. government deal with their data department is weird, but at least they have one. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a great book that made me pause many times think. This is the kind of book I love to read. I heard some criticism about Yuval&amp;rsquo;s books and they are mostly related to his way to connect things that he is not an expert about. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s the best part of the books because it also makes me consider the connections and think about them.</description>

      <description>This is an amazing book! I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about productivity and habits for a while now and I think this book does a great work of gathering everything together and presenting it in a nice form.
I think I liked it even more because I already apply many of the tips written here and I can assure (at least to myself) that it actually works. I have to say that it was really great to hear confirmation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing for years.</description>

I just read Sapiens and I don&amp;rsquo;t think this book is so good as Sapiens is, that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to go with 4 stars.
I like the way Yuval brings some topics to the discussion. This book made me think about many things I usually don&amp;rsquo;t think about. Religion is a topic I like to read/listen to from different angles, for example.</description>

This book was a big hit in Brazil for a while and of course, I heard about it in the past. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit skeptical about books that became a hit, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t pick this one. My sister asked me to buy this book for her as a gift and I decided to buy one for me too so we could discuss it.</description>

This one is hard to rate. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I liked it or not, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably related to the structure of the book.
It starts as a non-fiction/business book, as I expected it to be, but out of nowhere, it became &amp;ldquo;a novel&amp;rdquo; (big quotes here). This &amp;ldquo;novel&amp;rdquo; part was not too bad, I liked it in the end, but it was totally unexpected.</description>

One of the best books I ever read. The amount of information here is huge. There are many things I did not know about the history and some possible explanations about where we came to the current state.
I really like the way the author says &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t know this yet&amp;rdquo;. Sometimes, we just don&amp;rsquo;t have the answer but we have many proposed theories, so he talks about them and lets you reach your own conclusions.</description>

I was between 3 and 4 stars and decided to go with 3 for this one.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good book, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to complain about it. Some &amp;ldquo;laws&amp;rdquo; seem to be fillers to me, but many make total sense.
I would recommend it to someone, but reading a summary first would probably give you 80% of the value the book can bring.</description>

I follow their blog for a while now and like it a lot, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the same feeling with the book.
It was interesting to read that they felt themselves to be privileged when comparing to the rest of the population. Financial independence is not for everyone but frugality can be and that&amp;rsquo;s what they tried to say, IMO.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a good book. It&amp;rsquo;s repetitive and a bit outdated (I heard Google reader somewhere) but all the hints here are still valid.
To summarize: the focus is everything. Chose something you want to do and do it. Remove everything else that&amp;rsquo;s not moving you toward your priorities and do what you have to do.</description>

Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s true, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be crazy at work. We can still do our best and deliver an amazing product without making ourselves miserable working like crazy to meet some made-up numbers used as &amp;ldquo;goals&amp;rdquo;.</description>

There are many good ideas in this book and many of the things I see here are logical. If you&amp;rsquo;re a logical person (instead of an emotional one) you will understand many of the strategies he describes in this book.</description>

I was between a 4 and 5 stars for this book and decided to go with 4.
The ideas behind this book are amazing, especially when you read a little bit about Orwell and the political scenario of the time. It is a criticism of many things but it&amp;rsquo;s still an interesting construct of what may happen in a very extreme scenario.
The whole idea of creating a language to limit how people describe things and how they think is a really interesting concept.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s an OK book if you&amp;rsquo;re a Tolkien fan.
For those who like Tolkien and everything he researched, it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting book to read. I would not recommend this book to someone who&amp;rsquo;s not into Tolkien.
There are three poems in this book and it tries to tell a story about how Tolkien wrote the final poem. None of them are that great alone but together they show one particular part of Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s style of writing/researching.</description>

A great book if you are a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien (like me).
I read 10+ J.R.R. Tolkien books already. I really like the descriptive way of writing and the whole fantasy world he created. I also read some other books that are not related to middle earth.
With that said, it was amazing to me to find so much that was not explicit in the story.</description>

Nice book but not that simple for those who are not engaged with physics. That&amp;rsquo;s not a problem with the book, IMO, physics is complicated.
The pacing of the book is really good. He starts with the basics of physics and how paper after paper it is changing. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how Stephen Hawking puts himself as part of that story, not the center of it.</description>

I would totally recommend you to read it since it&amp;rsquo;s not expensive and quick to read/listen to (around 1 hour on Audible).

      <description>Book: The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It&amp;rsquo;s a good book overall, especially if you are (or want to be) a CEO. Some (many?) ideas are not aligned with the way I would manage my own company, but there are many useful insights into hairy situations one may be faced during his CEO time.
Sometimes the author contradicts himself, IMO.</description>

Good book overall, I did not take notes because it seems like a fictional book. :P
If you like this book I would also recommend you to read Masters of Doom and some chapters of Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution where they tell some game companies stories.
I would also add Indie game: the movie (also available on Netflix) to the list of complimentary content.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a good book. There are some good insights, some things that only work for a particular context, and some others that I disagree.
I have to highlight one item of my notes:
&amp;ldquo;Even working remotely should be avoided because misalignment can creep in whenever colleagues aren&amp;rsquo;t together full-time, in the same place, every day&amp;rdquo;</description>

 Wait, What?: And Life&amp;rsquo;s Other Essential Questions: Exactly what the author says in the beginning: It&amp;rsquo;s a lecture that became a book. Not bad, but OK-ish.

The book is exactly what the author says in the beginning: It&amp;rsquo;s a lecture that became a book. It can be summarized in less than 10 lines. Please read the other reviews and you will know the whole book.</description>

Great book if you&amp;rsquo;re curious about stoicism and its practices. After reading this I found that I&amp;rsquo;m practicing many techniques of stoicism for many years without knowing it.
The book starts with the history of stoicism, the first stoics, and the context of their time. The beginning is not pragmatic as I was expecting but when I finished the book, I decided it was a good thing.</description>

Nice book. I first heard of Josh when listening to Tim Ferriss show and then I got a recommendation (tks, Amir!).
The author is the guy from &amp;ldquo;Searching for Bobby Fischer&amp;rdquo; movie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108065/). He was a chess prodigy as a kid and a Tai Chi Chuan champion as an adult. The links between the learning of martial arts and chess are really interesting.</description>

I just read &amp;ldquo;rich dad poor dad&amp;rdquo; before reading this one and I think it ruined my experience. After reading that book first, this one looks like a puzzle you already know the answer.
This book is a series of parables of the &amp;ldquo;richest man in Babylon&amp;rdquo; (as you expect) and you need to read the parables understand the context and translate it to your life if you want to get something useful from it.</description>

The first part of this book was truly amazing. I really enjoyed the way he was showing the difference that both dads tell him how to live life and invest in his future. It was really great to take children for that because some things just don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for a child and are really easy to explain to the reader without having to rely on his current knowledge.</description>

      <description>Book: Anything You Want by Derek Sivers. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Amazing book! It&amp;rsquo;s worth 5 stars.
I listened to it on Audible, and it&amp;rsquo;s around 1h30 of audio, straight to the point. He is not theorizing about what should be right or what you should do to be successful. Instead, he is talking about his experience and what he thinks were the goods and bad choices he made.
This book was concise enough and with tons of valuable information to earn this 5 stars review.</description>

I received this book from a monk while walking on the streets of York (UK) last year. I gave a small donation, and he told me to keep the book, so I decided to read it. He said it was about meditation, but it&amp;rsquo;s about yoga in general (not the physical practice).
I was not aware of anything related to Bhagavad Gita, Krishna, or anything like that, so it was an enjoyable reading for me.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I posted my yearly review publicly but as I&amp;rsquo;m doing monthly posts of my stats, it makes sense to do an annual review as well.
I do yearly reviews since around 2005 but I never post them publicly. I also write down my goals for the next year, so I can review them in the last week of the year (like I did some weeks ago).</description>

Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft, called At the mountains of madness was one of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read about minimalism just to realize that I&amp;rsquo;m a minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to listen to their podcast and read their website.</description>

The first H.P. Lovecraft book I read/listen and now I understand what people say from his descriptions.
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how he keeps the suspense until the last 5% of the book. The bad part is that it becomes boring sometimes. You want to understand was is there and why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it but he keeps describing icy mountains and large rooms.</description>

I listen to their Podcast and read some articles on their website. This book looks like a list of pointers to their website.

Not that much to learn from this &amp;ldquo;book&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s really small (almost two hours of audio) and looks like an abridged version of a collection of other books. I&amp;rsquo;m not American, so I&amp;rsquo;m not part of the context or his target audience and maybe it also plays some role here.
The whole thing about the electricity was a reality for my mom (and for me when I visited my grandparents as a child) in Brazil, it may be shocking to people living in New York nowadays but I already knew all of that in my own context.</description>

Books 
What Doesn‚Äôt Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength is a book that describes what the human body can do if trained for it.

Let&amp;rsquo;s start with two small books I read. Cesar Millan&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Audiobooks for Dogs and Cesar Millan&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog. These two books were free on Audible for Dogs, so I decided to give them a try.</description>

      <description>Book: Rendezvous with Rama (Rama, #1) by Arthur C. Clarke. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I tend to not read much science fiction but this is a great book.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien because I love the way he used to build his world. I found Rama an amazing place where things work in a different way but following most of the same laws we have.
Arthur C. Clarke writes in a nice way, adding the exact number of details you need to feel immersed in the story without adding too much information.</description>

      <description>Book: My Favorite Universe by Neil deGrasse Tyson. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
A good book to introduce physics to common people.
Neil deGrasse Tyson is great at explaining complicated topics in a simple way. The explanation of dense objects using hot chocolate and cream was really nice for me (no spoilers, read it! :D).
Did you watch Cosmos? Do you like to (or at least used to) follow Discovery Channel space documentaries? In case your answer is yes to any of these questions, you probably already know most part of this book.</description>

      <description>Book: Cesar Millan&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog by Cesar Millan. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Nice book for those thinking about adopting a shelter dog and did not research it yet.
I adopted my dog from a local shelter, he was abandoned at the shelter door with his brothers as a puppy. He was 2 months old when we adopted him. I had to do some research in different sources and buy some e-&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Book: Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity by Kim Malone Scott. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
A book every boss should read. It helps to create a culture of giving and receiving honest feedback and create great teams. It has many truths, you will notice many of them if you&amp;rsquo;re working for a big company. You may not agree with some parts of it depending on how you see work and people but if you really care about people careers and the performance of your team it makes a lot of sense.</description>

      <description>Okay, here we go for the first full month working in my new job. :)
Books 
This month I read Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman, which was recommended by the other Doisters. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book by the guy who built the company Patagonia, a bootstrapped company, from scratch. Their way of thinking looks a lot like the way we think at Doist.</description>

Talking to Fabio Akita about my Archlinux tunning, I heard that I should be posting about that. That&amp;rsquo;s true, so I decided to start writing it. I wrote in March and it was in draft form since then, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to release it. :)</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a great book.
I know ASOIAF from the TV show &amp;ldquo;Game of Thrones&amp;rdquo;. This book was the first one I bought at Audible but decided to not start with it (33hs of content). As the 7th season of the TV show started, I decided to gather more information about the whole plot.</description>

      <description>Book: Practice Perfect: 42 Rules for Getting Better at Getting Better by Doug Lemov. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
A good book with lots of advice. The structure is not so good, but it&amp;rsquo;s OK.
As the title says, it shows 42 rules to improve yourself and practice in the right way. It an introduction, 42 tips on how to get better at getting better, a conclusion, and the appendices. The structure looks like a to-do list of &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo;, so it&amp;rsquo;s not so comfortable to read.</description>

Books 
Last month I read Deep Work again because I was preparing to work for a new company. The new company is Doist, but this is a topic for a another post. It proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From their reading list I also took The score takes care of itself and Start with Why.</description>

It was 3 stars until 70% of the book but the ending deserves 4.
This book is the story of Patagonia and how its founders deal with business, people, and the environment.
Their way of life resonates a lot with what I think is a good way to live. Maintain a sustainable business, hire people you trust and give them enough freedom to live a good life while giving their best to make the company grow, thinking about the environment, grow only when you have to grow (to supply your demand), live a minimalistic life, and so many other stuff.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a great book on leadership. I confess that I was really bored in the first 15% of the book. The beginning is boring for those who don&amp;rsquo;t give a f*ck about football but keep reading, it worth the journey. Bill Walsh took the San Francisco 49ers from a really bad performance (2 wins/14 losses) to an amazing one (13 win/3 losses) 2 years later.</description>

But this time I decided to post about the whole transition, since I started my blog, back in 2008.
I needed a blog at the time but could not spend time creating something, I just wanted to &amp;ldquo;buy a blog&amp;rdquo; and write. Dreamhost was an awesome service for that. In one hour I bought a domain, installed a Wordpress via one click install and set up my own email via Google apps (at the time it was free).</description>

Books 
I will start a in a new company this month, so I decided to re-read Deep Work (I really recommend this one). This book is just great for everyone who wants to focus and do the hard work.

A good book, but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not for me.
I really like books that have a lot of research behind it, this is one of them. For almost every assumption made, the author reveals research done to support his point.

Here are some few sentences I like and some comments on them:

An ordinary book. 3 stars are good enough.
The whole book discusses how to do business when you have no money. Daymond is the man behind Fubu and a TV show called Shark Tank. His story is really interesting to follow because he raised his entire business out of nothing, following the power of broke principle.</description>

It is nice to read if you already read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This book shows a lot of details that Tolkien used as a guideline to write the book.</description>

The whole book is about meditation and I would say 50% of it is about focusing on your breathe.
The chapter about loving kindness is also interesting. There are some quotes of Buddha that are really great.

      <description>Book: Mastery by Robert Greene. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
One of the best books I ever read.
This book goes through the life of various masters of our history. Some of them I did not know and decided to look after their life, which was a great experience as well.
If you want to be a master of something, be prepared to use a huge amount of time dealing with it and practicing.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: When traveling to Europe, I decided to take 2 or 3 days to visit Oxford. I will describe how was the experience of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan there.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien. Have read most of his books, the ones released when he was still alive and other edited by Christopher Tolkien.
After attending FOSDEM I decided to travel around some countries in Europe and UK. The most expensive part, the airplane tickets (Brazil -&amp;gt; Europe), were already paid, so&amp;hellip; why not?</description>

      <description>TL;DR: It was my first time at FOSDEM and it took some time to feel comfortable, this post may help newcomers.
As I mentioned in my previous post, I spoke at FOSDEM this year. It was my first time there (in the whole Europe, btw!) and it took some time to get used to the way the event goes. This post will show some tips that may help FOSDEM newcomers and maybe some veterans as well.</description>

      <description>This year my proposal to speak at FOSDEM was accepted and I spoke at the Desktop devroom! :)
It was my first talk in English, so I decided to do as many rehearsals as I could. I was 8 in total, but as expected, it was still a little bit faster than expected. :P
I had 30 minutes to present and I did it in 26. I usually speak fast and this presentation was made to be fast because I had a lot of content to show in 30 minutes.</description>

      <description>Book: The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I decided to read this book one month before visiting the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam. My plan is to use the whole context of the book to have the full experience when visiting the museum.
The book is OK. Most part of it is just what you expect from a diary of a 14 years old girl, even with the whole context implied.</description>

      <description>Book: Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
It was a good reading. I would review this book as 3 stars but at the end, I was convinced that it made me think about many interesting things on successful people in general.
The key point of this book is: what makes successful people is a match of many factors. Some of those factors were not clear to me.</description>

      <description>Book: The Memory Illusion: Remembering, Forgetting, and the Science of False Memory by Julia Shaw. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
The whole point of this book is to show that our memories are not reliable. We can&amp;rsquo;t be sure that something happened because a lot of things may influence our past memories.
The good argument in favor of this book is its references. There are many references for academic studies. The bad part is that it is not so comfortable to read, the language is not that good.</description>

This is that kind of book that does not answer questions, it just creates a lot more. :)
I tend to not implement algorithms just for the sake of learning a new one and this is not a good thing. When you read these kinds of books you understand why it&amp;rsquo;s so important to know which kinds of algorithms already exists and which problems they solve.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not the best Elixir book I read but it&amp;rsquo;s a good book.
I started with Programming Phoenix for a more practical learning. This book feels like the other &amp;ldquo;Programming language book&amp;rdquo;. You will find how to split a string, or how you can deal with regex. In case you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the methods for many types, it will be for you.</description>

It was good at the beginning but the end was too self-help for me.
I learned good things in this book and that&amp;rsquo;s what matters for me.
Here are my raw notes about the book:

      <description>Book: TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking by Chris J. Anderson. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
There are some cool tips in this book but it&amp;rsquo;s not so straight to the point if you&amp;rsquo;re just looking for speaking tips. If you like to speak at IT events (like I do) I really recommend http://speaking.io.
This book shows the way to deliver a presentation that earns a standing ovation at the end.</description>

I really like this book. I would recommend it if you are the kind of person that wants to make a difference in the world and want to be remembered in the future generations. The book will not give you that but if you follow a methodology like it recommends you will get closer to your big goals.</description>

This is the first biography that I read and I found it amazing.
I knew that Albert Einstein was a genius but it was not just that. He was extremely devoted to what he did. I had many quotes from this book and one of them shows what I just said:
&amp;ldquo;As long as I am able to work, I must not and will not complain, because work is the only thing that gives substance to life&amp;rdquo;</description>

It is a great book for web developers learning Elixir (yeah, not just Phoenix).
I&amp;rsquo;m on the path of playing with Elixir and was looking for a book to amplify my knowledge. I first started with Programming Elixir, from Dave Thomas but I was looking for something more practical.
I decided to try Programming Phoenix and found that it shows everything I need to know about Elixir to build a web application.</description>

This is a great book for IT folks.
In case you worked (or still work) in a big company with lots of ITIL things that holds the development, this book will be like home for you.
It is a typical hero&amp;rsquo;s journey and the characters are not so well developed (IMO) but the story is still good to follow.</description>

I already use many of the tips mentioned in this book and they really work. It makes a good pair with habitica.com, in case you like to play these kinds of games in real life.
There are many great references for the nerds out there.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve used the Audible Abridged version for this one. The narration is not good as the other audiobooks I&amp;rsquo;m used to listen.
The book content is not good to follow as well. It is focused on interrogation and this is not my goal for reading it.
But it is not all that bad. I got some interesting tips on body language and these kind of stuff.</description>

The concept of system 1 (fast) and system 2 (slow) is really great.
For tech folks, the system 1 looks like a cache inside your head. It is the best way to explain it for tech related people, in my opinion.
There are dozens of serious research done to make this book happen. They were not made exclusively for the book, but it is really nice to read a book that has strong foundations.</description>

Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to &amp;ldquo;properly read/listen&amp;rdquo; now.
I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results.</description>

This book is amazing! There are some non-sense parts but in general, it makes you think about &amp;ldquo;life, universe, and everything&amp;rdquo;.
There are some ideas that look so absurd in real life but make sense in the book context. If you&amp;rsquo;re that kind of geek/nerd that likes physics (you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert, just an enthusiast) this book will be great.</description>

Did you watch the movie?
Yes: you&amp;rsquo;re done. The book does not add anything relevant IMO.
No: Watch the movie.
In case you prefer books than movies, you may try this one. It is not a bad book and you will see how a smart guy can be a perfect asshole.
The only thing that I absorved from this book is: This kind of life is not for me.</description>

This is a good book. There are some good examples there and it is worth reading, but if you want to understand the habits in a quick and easy manner just read on the author&amp;rsquo;s website.
There are some great insights, at least for me, in this book. The author says that the world works on the &amp;ldquo;outside-in&amp;rdquo; but we need to work on the &amp;ldquo;inside out&amp;rdquo;, taking care of ourselves and doing the best to make things better.</description>

Some of them can&amp;rsquo;t be applied to big and established companies, but it shows why small companies can beat them if they know how to organize. &amp;ldquo;Divide and conquer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Do only what is needed&amp;rdquo; are the core of this book IMO.</description>

      <description>Book: Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
Great book. John Carmack said it was the most inspiring book for him and I can understand why.
The word Hackers is not the same these days, but the Hacker Ethics still lives in some of the programmers out there. Those guys that keep hacking (and/or programming) for hours and hours just for the joy of create and modify things still exists.</description>

      <description>Book: MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom by Anthony Robbins. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
I have mixed feelings about this one. I got some cool insights about financing and how I can improve my plant of financial freedom, but the book was repetitive most of the time.
When I started this book my feeling was: &amp;ldquo;Man, this may be one of the best books I read&amp;rdquo;. Some time ago I was reading a lot of &amp;ldquo;soon you&amp;rsquo;ll see&amp;rdquo; or even repeating what was said before.</description>

      <description>Book: A Study in Scarlet (Sherlock Holmes, #1) by Arthur Conan Doyle. Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
A good book! I always wanted to read Sherlock Holmes books but never tried it. Thanks to BBC&amp;rsquo;s Sherlock Series I decided to give it a try. The good part is that I could understand a lot of jokes that the TV show made and the differences from the 189x to 201x. :)
I really recommend you to read it if you like stories on investigation.</description>

I love this book. The two Johns created an empire by using the engineering capabilities of Carmack with the enthusiasm and ideas of Romero.
There are some other thoughts to put in this book. The two Johns are doing great and creating amazing games following the startup way of life, relying on junk food and diet coke.</description>

TL; DR - A lot of theories about the next economic crash, if you want to know some connections between gold, dollar and other different investments to protect you in case it happens, it may be a good book for you.
I&amp;rsquo;m Brazilian and some part of the economic context is not the same here, but there are some parts make totally sense.</description>

Nice book with really interesting statistics done in some sets of data. It remembers me about the whole &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; trend that we have today.
In some parts it looks like the comparison of the global warming and the number of pirates (as my &amp;ldquo;Statistics One&amp;rdquo; professor and the book author used to say: &amp;ldquo;correlation does not imply causation&amp;rdquo;), but the whole idea behind the studies are really interesting.</description>

I read this book in 2015 when the product director of the company I worked for suggested to buy a bunch of copies and do a book club on that book. The director (and many of us, leaders) liked the ideas here, but there were not not attractive to the rest of the directors. Needless to say that reading this didn&amp;rsquo;t change anything in how the company does things.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I like Colemak, and it is a very good layout. I found some equivalent pros and cons, so I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to anyone without a little bit of philosophy. :)
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Colemak, it is a keyboard layout created to make the most used keys stay in the home row as well as make you swipe between your right and left hand.
There is a keyboard layouts heatmap for you to understand the benefits of using a keyboard layout that was designed to help you to be comfortable and fast when typing instead of one that helping the operator to not jam the typewriter.</description>

OSCON (Open Source Conference) is one of the most important open source conferences of our time and happened in Portland this year as usual. Portland is a great city, the one I liked the most until now, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have high car traffic, MAX (the train) took us for most of the places we wanted to know, nice people all over the place, great convention center and a lot of other benefits.</description>

Just to be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t think wordpress is not good at all, but I want to publish static files instead of keeping the wordpress &amp;ldquo;infrastructure&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve divided into 3 feeds:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Go last month and I really liked to work with the language.
The project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is dead simple and just retrieves metrics and save on a redis server (the data will be analyzed by a different project that I&amp;rsquo;m working on). So I have 15 goroutines retrieving data constantly and I&amp;rsquo;m using just two native threads.
I did some CPU profiling on the code using my current machine for Golang 1.</description>

Dominic is trying to show that Javascript is not a good language to develop the next AAA game but it is awesome to make simple games and have it easily available to the world.
We have a lot of negative comments on the post (I really don&amp;rsquo;t know why) but some good ones too.</description>

The reasons for the decision:
I have a hardware that works better with the newer kernels. I really want to understand the linux kernel better. As Judas Priest sings on Painkiller song: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm living on the eeeeeedge‚Äù. LOL
How to proceed There are some steps to follow when compiling a new kernel for your Linux box:</description>

      <description>Every time we need to deploy a new Ruby application on top of Debian Squeeze we need to fix some Ruby depedencies to make the application work as it should.
It happens because we&amp;rsquo;re building using rvm instead of the packaged version of ruby, but it needed to be that way in order to use our old build server.
I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it documented here:

I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, the Silmarilion is not an easy to read book. I would not recommend it to anyone who was not totally aware of the other books and still looking for more middle earth content.</description>

N√£o sei bem qual rumo minha vida vai seguir nesse novo ano, o que eu vou ter que aprender e estudar, talvez eu tenha que aprender coisas que eu n√£o tinha planejado e isso pode tomar uma boa parte do meu tempo, mas eu pretendo postar todos os meus estudos aqui, portanto terei algum material interessante aqui.</description>

      <description>I wrote desconstruindo a web in 2016 and my goal was to help web developers to understand the whole cycle of their application, from the initial keystroke to the loaded page.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand all the pieces involved in a web request so we can better debug problems happening in this process. The internet is a complex system and many parts can fail, knowing the purpose of each is quite useful when something goes wrong.</description>

      <description>This is my now page, inspired by Derek Sievers.
I&amp;rsquo;m living in S√£o Paulo, Brazil and working for Doist remotely and asynchronously full-time.
Intervac when there time to spare.
Here is a list of my current priorities:
 Improving Todoist and Twist APIs and backend codebase at Doist. Mostly working with Python and Golang. Improving my Rust skills and trying to contribute to the compiler (not much time for it nowadays, unfortunately) Co-authoring a book about Rust in pt-BR ü¶Ä Taking care of my twin children at home with all its ups and downs.</description>
