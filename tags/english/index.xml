      <description>February time! Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we can get from my metrics. üòÄ
Books Note: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on my Goodreads account.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite satisfied with my reading list for this month:

Five books read in a month and a 4.6 average rating. That&amp;rsquo;s what I call a good reading month.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to write this post about my performance for the first month of the year. I think I will have some great news at the end of this post, related to my expenses.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started! üòÄ
Books I decided to listen to my podcasts this month, so I did not hear that many audiobooks. The only book I read this month was a physical book:

Hiding in unnatural happiness is a book I received from a monk in York.</description>

      <title>2017 Year in Review (with metrics!)</title>

      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/2017-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>Brace yourselves, this post will be HUGE
TL;DR: It was a great year and I&amp;rsquo;m really glad to see the metrics and notice everything I accomplished.
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I posted my yearly review publicly but as I&amp;rsquo;m doing monthly posts of my stats, it makes sense to do an annual review as well.
I do yearly reviews since around 2005 but I never post them publicly.</description>

      <description>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel again this month. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.
Books I was traveling this month, so as usual, I&amp;rsquo;m not reading/listening to audiobooks because I prefer to focus on the place I&amp;rsquo;m visiting. For this reason, I did not finish any book this month.
With that said, it is the first time I have 4 books on my reading list at the same time.</description>

      <description>This will be a quick post to help people that are doing the same search as I was doing some minutes ago: &amp;ldquo;firefox disable ctrl+q&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m using Firefox Quantum for some weeks now (will probably post about it in the future) and the ctrl+q &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; really annoys me.
It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time that I hit ctrl+q by accident just to see the entire browser and tabs being closed without warning.</description>

Books 
Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft, called At the mountains of madness was one of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read about minimalism just to realize that I&amp;rsquo;m a minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to listen to their podcast and read their website.</description>

      <description>This month was very unusual because I was traveling through Portugal and Spain for work and tourism, so it will probably affect my stats a lot. With that said, let&amp;rsquo;s see how it is. üòÑ
Books I read some pages from Elixir in Action, but unfortunately did not finish any book this month. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t read that much when traveling, so it&amp;rsquo;s sad but expected. üòû
Articles As usual, I&amp;rsquo;m using that same export file from Pocket and the same script to calculate the amount of articles I read:</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m working on something I really believe is good at Doist and I feel great.
As I mentioned on this post (in pt-BR) I left the company I was working for the last year to join a new company. The new company is Doist and I&amp;rsquo;m working for them since July.
Some time ago a friend asked me why I joined Doist and I realized it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a love story so I decided to write the post.</description>

      <description>September is here, time to review my stats for August, 2017.
Books 
This is my personal record of books read in one single month. 7 freaking books. üò±
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with two small books I read. Cesar Millan&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Audiobooks for Dogs and Cesar Millan&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog. These two books were free on Audible for Dogs, so I decided to give them a try.</description>

      <description>Okay, here we go for the first full month working in my new job. :)
Books 
This month I read Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman, which was recommended by the other Doisters. It&amp;rsquo;s a great book by the guy who built the company Patagonia, a bootstrapped company, from scratch. Their way of thinking looks a lot like the way we think at Doist.</description>

Talking to Fabio Akita about my Archlinux tunning, I heard that I should be posting about that. That&amp;rsquo;s true, so I decided to start writing it. I wrote in March and it was in draft form since then, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to release it.</description>

Books 
Last month I read Deep Work again because I was preparing to work for a new company. The new company is Doist, but this is a topic for a another post. It proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From their reading list I also took The score takes care of itself and Start with Why.</description>

      <description>Yes, it was a journey. I decided to chance my blog engine again.
But this time I decided to post about the whole transition, since I started my blog, back in 2008.
I needed a blog at the time but could not spend time creating something, I just wanted to &amp;ldquo;buy a blog&amp;rdquo; and write. Dreamhost was an awesome service for that. In one hour I bought a domain, installed a Wordpress via one click install and set up my own email via Google apps (at the time it was free).</description>

      <description>Here we go again for my stats for the last month. :)
Books 
I will start a in a new company this month, so I decided to re-read Deep Work (I really recommend this one). This book is just great for everyone who wants to focus and do the hard work. It has everything to do with my new work schedule. The book about Elon Musk was a good reading as well, this guy has some great ideas.</description>

      <description>This was not a good month. I spent most of the time sick, recovering from what may be a Labyrinthitis. I still have to confirm that, but I&amp;rsquo;m in slow motion for a while.
But anyways, let&amp;rsquo;s go to the collected data.
Books Books for this month:

&amp;ldquo;Einstein no Brasil&amp;rdquo; (Einstein in Brazil) is a physical book I borrowed from a friend and The Art of The Lord of the Rings I have in my shelf (as a good LotR fan).</description>

      <description>Back to work this month. :)
After one month vacation, I got back to my routine and got some good results this month.
Books Added three more books to the list:

I have to note here that Mastery is one of the best books I ever read. Both Mindfulness in plain English and The Urban Monk are about meditation and how to live a minimalist life.
Articles I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to find a way to track the articles I read.</description>

      <description>February was an atypical month because I was on vacation. :)
Much of my stats will reflect my travel around Europe. But no coding was done during this trip.
Books Continuing my goal to read 30 books this year, I read two books this month:

I had plans to visit Amsterdam and Oxford during my travel. Because of that I decided to read the story of Kullervo, which mention a lot about J.</description>

This is not a new idea, I&amp;rsquo;m inspired by posts like this from Matthew of truevalhalla.com.
Books My goal is to read 30 books this year, so I must have an average of 2.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: When traveling to Europe, I decided to take 2 or 3 days to visit Oxford. I will describe how was the experience of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan there.
I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien. Have read most of his books, the ones released when he was still alive and other edited by Christopher Tolkien.
After attending FOSDEM I decided to travel around some countries in Europe and UK.</description>

As I mentioned in my previous post, I spoke at FOSDEM this year. It was my first time there (in the whole Europe, btw!) and it took some time to get used to the way the event goes. This post will show some tips that may help FOSDEM newcomers and maybe some veterans as well.</description>

It was my first talk in English, so I decided to do as many rehearsals as I could. I was 8 in total, but as expected, it was still a little bit faster than expected. :P
I had 30 minutes to present and I did it in 26. I usually speak fast and this presentation was made to be fast because I had a lot of content to show in 30 minutes.</description>

      <guid>http://pothix.com/post/experiences-of-almost-two-years-using-colemak/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: I like Colemak, and it is a very good layout. I found some equivalent pros and cons, so I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to anyone without a little bit of philosophy. :)
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Colemak, it is a keyboard layout created to make the most used keys stay in the home row as well as make you swipe between your right and left hand.
There is a keyboard layouts heatmap for you to understand the benefits of using a keyboard layout that was designed to help you to be comfortable and fast when typing instead of one that helping the operator to not jam the typewriter.</description>

OSCON (Open Source Conference) is one of the most important open source conferences of our time and happened in Portland this year as usual. Portland is a great city, the one I liked the most until now, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have high car traffic, MAX (the train) took us for most of the places we wanted to know, nice people all over the place, great convention center and a lot of other benefits.</description>

I decided that the time has came to change not just the layout but the blog engine as well. I&amp;rsquo;m now using middleman instead of wordpress. Just to be clear, I don&amp;rsquo;t think wordpress is not good at all, but I want to publish static files instead of keeping the wordpress &amp;ldquo;infrastructure&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Go last month and I really liked to work with the language.
The project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is dead simple and just retrieves metrics and save on a redis server (the data will be analyzed by a different project that I&amp;rsquo;m working on). So I have 15 goroutines retrieving data constantly and I&amp;rsquo;m using just two native threads.
I did some CPU profiling on the code using my current machine for Golang 1.</description>

      <description>I read the blog post from Impact engine creator Dominic where he shows an email he sent to John Carmack about his opinions on Javascript expressed on his keynote.
Dominic is trying to show that Javascript is not a good language to develop the next AAA game but it is awesome to make simple games and have it easily available to the world.
We have a lot of negative comments on the post (I really don&amp;rsquo;t know why) but some good ones too.</description>

      <description>Since I bought an Acer notebook to use Linux again (I sold my mac, I have a post about it but in portuguese) I started to compile my own kernel.
The reasons for the decision:
I have a hardware that works better with the newer kernels. I really want to understand the linux kernel better. As Judas Priest sings on Painkiller song: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm living on the eeeeeedge‚Äù. LOL
How to proceed There are some steps to follow when compiling a new kernel for your Linux box:</description>

      <title>Simlinks for ruby on Debian Squeeze</title>

      <description>Every time we need to deploy a new Ruby application on top of Debian Squeeze we need to fix some Ruby depedencies to make the application work as it should.
It happens because we&amp;rsquo;re building using rvm instead of the packaged version of ruby, but it needed to be that way in order to use our old build server.
I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it documented here:
ln -s /usr/lib/libruby-1.9.1.so.1.9.1 /usr/lib/libruby.so.1.9 ln -s /usr/bin/rake1.</description>

Finally i finished to translate all the presentation! Watched the video a lot of times, pausing and playing to write all I said translating to english. :)
Fortunately I had a big help from my friend Victor Goff, that corrected all my grammar errors and typos.
I&amp;rsquo;m posting below all i have about the presentation, slides from Slideshare and a translation pasted here, but you can find the translation at Google Docs too.</description>

      <description>Estou apenas postando para dizer que nesse novo ano eu pretendo postar mais sobre programa√ß√£o! Essa √© a primeira virada de ano desse blog, ent√£o resolvi postar meus &amp;ldquo;planos&amp;rdquo; para o pr√≥ximo ano.
Como o blog √© novo eu comecei a escrever faz pouco tempo e estou pegando experi√™ncia aos poucos, e talvez agora nesse novo ano a qualidade dos posts aumente! (ou n√£o&amp;hellip;heheh).
N√£o sei bem qual rumo minha vida vai seguir nesse novo ano, o que eu vou ter que aprender e estudar, talvez eu tenha que aprender coisas que eu n√£o tinha planejado e isso pode tomar uma boa parte do meu tempo, mas eu pretendo postar todos os meus estudos aqui, portanto terei algum material interessante aqui.</description>

      <description>Hi international friends! :)
I&amp;rsquo;m just posting to inform that I want to post some content in English too! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make a RSS Feed only for my English posts, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to view my portuguese posts on your feed reader. :)
As everyone knows, my English is not so good, but I think you can understand me well! Any English errors (I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will have a lot of them) please tell me and I&amp;rsquo;ll correct it asap.</description>
