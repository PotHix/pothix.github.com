                    <p>March is gone, and it&rsquo;s time for metrics! 📊
Books Note: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on my Goodreads account.
Just one book this month, but a 5 stars one:

When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing. This book is about optimization based on time and energy. What is the best time to do some action based on statistics? I found it to be amazing and could confirm many of the assumptions with my data.</p>

Books Note: I write a review for each book I read. You can find them on my Goodreads account.
I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with my reading list for this month:

Five books read in a month and a 4.6 average rating. That&rsquo;s what I call a good reading month.
The Art of Learning: A Journey in the Pursuit of Excellence.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;m excited to write this post about my performance for the first month of the year. I think I will have some great news at the end of this post, related to my expenses.
Let&rsquo;s get started! 😀
Books I decided to listen to my podcasts this month, so I did not hear that many audiobooks. The only book I read this month was a physical book:

Hiding in unnatural happiness is a book I received from a monk in York.</p>

                    <p>Brace yourselves, this post will be HUGE
TL;DR: It was a great year and I&rsquo;m really glad to see the metrics and notice everything I accomplished.
I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I posted my yearly review publicly but as I&rsquo;m doing monthly posts of my stats, it makes sense to do an annual review as well.
I do yearly reviews since around 2005 but I never post them publicly. I also write down my goals for the next year, so I can review them in the last week of the year (like I did some weeks ago).</p>

                    <p>Came back from a travel last month and just packed my stuff to travel again this month. Let&rsquo;s see if it affected my performance.
Books I was traveling this month, so as usual, I&rsquo;m not reading/listening to audiobooks because I prefer to focus on the place I&rsquo;m visiting. For this reason, I did not finish any book this month.
With that said, it is the first time I have 4 books on my reading list at the same time.</p>

                    <p>This will be a quick post to help people that are doing the same search as I was doing some minutes ago: &ldquo;firefox disable ctrl+q&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m using Firefox Quantum for some weeks now (will probably post about it in the future) and the ctrl+q &ldquo;feature&rdquo; really annoys me.
It&rsquo;s not the first time that I hit ctrl+q by accident just to see the entire browser and tabs being closed without warning.</p>

Books 
Read three books this month. My first book of H.P. Lovecraft, called At the mountains of madness was one of them. It was an interesting experience to read it. I also read about minimalism just to realize that I&rsquo;m a minimalism since forever. If you like minimalism I also recommend to listen to their podcast and read their website.</p>

                    <p>This month was very unusual because I was traveling through Portugal and Spain for work and tourism, so it will probably affect my stats a lot. With that said, let&rsquo;s see how it is. 😄
Books I read some pages from Elixir in Action, but unfortunately did not finish any book this month. I usually don&rsquo;t read that much when traveling, so it&rsquo;s sad but expected. 😞
Articles As usual, I&rsquo;m using that same export file from Pocket and the same script to calculate the amount of articles I read:</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s already the end of October and I could not manage to post my stats from September but I have a good reason for that (which you will read about in the next month 😉).
Books 
What Doesn’t Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength is a book that describes what the human body can do if trained for it. The writing process is not so good for my taste, sometimes it looks like a memoir, sometimes it&rsquo;s non-fiction&hellip; but the message it passes is really interesting.</p>

                    <p>TL;DR: I&rsquo;m working on something I really believe is good at Doist and I feel great.
As I mentioned on this post (in pt-BR) I left the company I was working for the last year to join a new company. The new company is Doist and I&rsquo;m working for them since July.
Some time ago a friend asked me why I joined Doist and I realized it&rsquo;s kind of a love story so I decided to write the post.</p>
