                    <p>September is here, time to review my stats for August, 2017.
Books 
This is my personal record of books read in one single month. 7 freaking books. 😱
Let&rsquo;s start with two small books I read. Cesar Millan&rsquo;s Guide to Audiobooks for Dogs and Cesar Millan&rsquo;s Guide to Bringing Home a Shelter Dog. These two books were free on Audible for Dogs, so I decided to give them a try.</p>

                    <p>Okay, here we go for the first full month working in my new job. :)
Books 
This month I read Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman, which was recommended by the other Doisters. It&rsquo;s a great book by the guy who built the company Patagonia, a bootstrapped company, from scratch. Their way of thinking looks a lot like the way we think at Doist.</p>

                    <p>I was playing with Archlinux in the last 3 or 4 years and last year I decided to reboot my configuration files and start using Xfce.
Talking to Fabio Akita about my Archlinux tunning, I heard that I should be posting about that. That&rsquo;s true, so I decided to start writing it. I wrote in March and it was in draft form since then, so it&rsquo;s time to release it. :)</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;m ready to review my stats for June and share them with you! Are you? Hope so! :D
Books 
Last month I read Deep Work again because I was preparing to work for a new company. The new company is Doist, but this is a topic for a another post. It proved to be a great asset, as they also recommend reading it. From their reading list I also took The score takes care of itself and Start with Why.</p>

                    <p>TL;DR: Esse mês eu completaria 7 anos trabalhando para a Locaweb, mas decidi sair no dia 2 de junho. Nada demais, só procurando coisas diferentes
Eu entrei na Locaweb em Junho de 2010. Na época o Fabio Kung entrou em contato comigo perguntando se eu queria me juntar a equipe de Cloud Computing.
A equipe de Cloud Depois de uma conversa com ele e com outro gestor, eu descobri que era exatamente o que eu queria fazer, trabalhar com Ruby e infraestrutura, duas coisas que eu gostava muito.</p>

                    <p>Yes, it was a journey. I decided to chance my blog engine again.
But this time I decided to post about the whole transition, since I started my blog, back in 2008.
I needed a blog at the time but could not spend time creating something, I just wanted to &ldquo;buy a blog&rdquo; and write. Dreamhost was an awesome service for that. In one hour I bought a domain, installed a Wordpress via one click install and set up my own email via Google apps (at the time it was free).</p>

                    <p>Here we go again for my stats for the last month. :)
Books 
I will start a in a new company this month, so I decided to re-read Deep Work (I really recommend this one). This book is just great for everyone who wants to focus and do the hard work. It has everything to do with my new work schedule. The book about Elon Musk was a good reading as well, this guy has some great ideas.</p>

                    <p>This was not a good month. I spent most of the time sick, recovering from what may be a Labyrinthitis. I still have to confirm that, but I&rsquo;m in slow motion for a while.
But anyways, let&rsquo;s go to the collected data.
Books Books for this month:

&ldquo;Einstein no Brasil&rdquo; (Einstein in Brazil) is a physical book I borrowed from a friend and The Art of The Lord of the Rings I have in my shelf (as a good LotR fan).</p>

                    <p>Back to work this month. :)
After one month vacation, I got back to my routine and got some good results this month.
Books Added three more books to the list:

I have to note here that Mastery is one of the best books I ever read. Both Mindfulness in plain English and The Urban Monk are about meditation and how to live a minimalist life.
Articles I&rsquo;m still trying to find a way to track the articles I read.</p>

                    <p>February was an atypical month because I was on vacation. :)
Much of my stats will reflect my travel around Europe. But no coding was done during this trip.
Books Continuing my goal to read 30 books this year, I read two books this month:

I had plans to visit Amsterdam and Oxford during my travel. Because of that I decided to read the story of Kullervo, which mention a lot about J.</p>
