      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I like colemak, and it is a &lt;em&gt;very good&lt;/em&gt; layout. I found some equivalent
pros and cons, so I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to anyone without a little bit of
philosophy. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;a href=&#34;http://colemak.com/&#34;&gt;Colemak&lt;/a&gt;, it is a keyboard layout
created to make the most used keys stay in the home row as well as make you
swipe between your right and left hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.patrick-wied.at/projects/heatmap-keyboard/&#34;&gt;keyboard layouts heatmap&lt;/a&gt;
for you to understand the benefits of using a keyboard layout that was designed
to help you to be confortable and fast when typing instead of one that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY&#34;&gt;helping the operator to not jam the typewriter&lt;/a&gt;.
I tried some code (python), English and Portuguese texts and it looks almost the
same on the heatmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using Colemak since Dec, 25 of 2013 and here are come pros and cons that I
found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first con is that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to type fast on qwerty anymore, now I&amp;rsquo;m
typing as I never saw a qwerty layout before. The problem is that everyone uses
this crappy layout and sometimes you need to use it to write and it makes you
look like a granpa. The good part is that I almots don&amp;rsquo;t need to use qwerty, all
devices that belog to me I&amp;rsquo;ve changed to colemak (computers, cellphones and so
on), so I just need to use qwerty when I&amp;rsquo;m typing on other peoples devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pro is that my typing speed grew from an average of 75 WPM to almost 100
WPM. I need to consider that I also bought a Kinesis Advantage Pro;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://pothix.com/images/posts/almost-two-years-using-colemak-kinesis.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kinesis advantage photo&#34; title=&#34;Kinesis Advantage&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without this keyboard I&amp;rsquo;m not that fast. Just tried
&lt;a href=&#34;http://10fastfingers.com/user/504663/&#34;&gt;10fastfingers now and got 92 WPM&lt;/a&gt; using
my laptop&amp;rsquo;s keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pro is that I really feel confortable using Colemak, you the same way as
being an experienced Vim user, looks like you don&amp;rsquo;t need to type so much. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, talking about Vim&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced Vim user, but Vim is totally
coupled with qwerty layout. I tried to remap some keys (like hjkl for example)
in order to keep using the home row to navigate but it was not very good. Totay
I&amp;rsquo;m just using plain colemak layout on Vim and it is not so good as it was on
qwerty. For this reason I decided to try a new editor and I&amp;rsquo;m using Emacs
now. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me at least a month to get back to my old typing speed, I was training
everyday on 10fastfinges to get used to the layout. In the beginning you may
feed some headaches because of the mind remapping. It&amp;rsquo;s not so easy to change
something that you thought was the only way of getting things done. It was a
great challenge for me and it just seems right, I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna use a keyboard
layout that was made to avoid jams on a typewriter, Jesus, we&amp;rsquo;re in 2015 and
there is not typewriters anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this post helps a lot of colemak newcommers and the only thing I could say
about my journey is that &lt;strong&gt;I would do it again if I could&lt;/strong&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;
